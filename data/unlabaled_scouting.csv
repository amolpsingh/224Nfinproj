"PERSON PERSON was the headliner in the three-prospect package the ORGANIZATION received from the ORGANIZATION for PERSON last July, but PERSON quickly asserted himself as one of the best starting pitchers in his new system. PERSON signed him for a well over-slot $600,000 as an 11th-rounder in 2016, one month after he infamously threw a 164-pitch complete game at ORGANIZATION (PERSON, Pa.). He impressed the ORGANIZATION so much in his first spring training that they sent him to low Class A at age 18, and he struck out 113 in 94 1/3 innings between the two organizations.PERSON added strength during his first full year in pro ball, boosting his high-spin-rate fastball consistently into the low 90s, and his 6-foot-4 frame still has room to add more muscle. His curveball already had good depth and added power as well, becoming a consistent plus pitch. His changeup isn't as consistent as his other offerings but has the makings of an average pitch.Because PERSON didn't become a full-time pitcher until his junior year in high school, he's just scratching the surface of his potential. There's still some effort in his delivery but he's athletic and toned it down in his first full season, so the ORGANIZATION think he'll throw more strikes. His curveball and competitiveness will serve him well if he eventually moves into the bullpen.",-1
"PERSON made headlines for all the wrong reasons when he threw a nine-inning, 164-pitch complete game at ORGANIZATION (PERSON, Pa.) in May 2016. A month later, the ORGANIZATION selected him in the 11th round and gave him $600,000 to pass up a commitment to GPE. He made such a good impression in his first Spring Training that he earned an assignment to low Class A at age 18, and he continued to stand out before the ORGANIZATION acquired him in the Yu Darvish trade in July.PERSON's best present weapon is his curveball, which has depth and could become a true plus offering once it adds more power. He usually works at 88-93 mph with his fastball and should add more velocity once he fills out his projectable 6-foot-4 frame. His changeup is more of a work in progress, but has some potential.He didn't become a full-time pitcher until he was a junior in high school, so PERSON still has room for lots of growth. He has a quick arm and his pitches should continue to improve as he gets stronger and refines his delivery. ORGANIZATION officials praise his competitive nature.",-1
"PERSON PERSON pitched at FACILITY (ORGANIZATION, GPE.) and GPE (GPE.) JC before embarking on a 14-year big league career. His nephew PERSON, meanwhile, is already following the same path. After turning down the ORGANIZATION as a 25th-round Draft pick, he returned to the ORGANIZATION and emerged as one of the top junior college pitching prospects, leading all Division I ORGANIZATION pitchers in strikeouts (156) and strikeout rate (18.8 per nine innings). The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their fourth-round pick in June, signed him for slightly above slot value and then watched him carve up hitters while reaching PERSON, where he posted double-digit strikeouts in two of his seven starts.PERSON's curveball is nasty, a true plus pitch that he can also manipulate to have harder, slider-like action. He opened his sophomore season throwing in the upper 80s but now sits 91-94 mph and can touch 96. His changeup has come along quickly in his first full season and gives PERSON a third big league-caliber pitch that he uses to neutralize right-handed hitters. PERSON works from the third-base side of the mound and has an athletic but funky delivery that masks everything he throws with deception.PERSON's delivery also can hamper his ability to throw strikes at times, and the ORGANIZATION hope to smoothen it out without costing him any of his natural deception. He might not have the cleanest profile and does come with some risk, but PERSON's bat-missing ability is undeniable and could help him rise through the ranks relatively quickly en route to a back-of-the-rotation role, perhaps even more.",-1

He opened his sophomore season throwing in the upper 80s but ended the year working at 91-94 mph while reaching double-digit strikeouts in his last five starts, including 17 in his final outing. He also has a changeup that he doesn't use very often. PERSON is athletic but has a funky delivery that hampers his ability to throw strikes. It does, however, give him plenty of deception, leading to lots of swings and misses. Some scouts worry that most of his whiffs come out of the zone, either on curveballs down or fastballs up, and wonder how his stuff will play against more advanced hitters. If it all clicks for PERSON, he could rise through the ranks relatively quickly en route to a back-of-the-rotation role, and perhaps even more.",-1
"The GPE continued their recent trend of collecting international players with advanced bats when they signed PERSON out of GPE for $1.5 million, the largest bonus in their 2017 class. He would have come to the GPE for his debut at age 17 last summer, but he fractured his right arm in May and missed the entire Rookie-level PERSON season. He's thriving while seeing his first pro action this summer in the AZL.A switch-hitter, PERSON has a quick, compact swing and exhibits precocious feel for the barrel from both sides of the plate. He makes repeated hard contact, already drives balls to the gaps and should have 20-homer power once he matures physically. Presently an above-average runner, he figures to slow down a bit as he gets stronger. Though PERSON would have broken into pro ball as a shortstop in 2018, most international scouts thought he was destined for second base and the GPE have deployed him there this summer. While his actions and average arm are substandard at short, his fast hands should be an asset when it comes to turning double plays at second. He could become a solid defender at second base if he can quicken his footwork.",-1
"Ranked No. 22 on ORGANIZATION's list of the Top 30 international prospects for 2017-18, GPE endeared himself to evaluators as a ORGANIZATION amateur with his projectable frame and overall potential as a switch-hitting shortstop. The Indians were among the teams intrigued by GPE's upside, so much so that they signed him with a $1.5 million bonus, the largest of all their July 2 signees.Scouts like GPE's balanced hitting approach at the plate, quick hands and short swing. He makes hard contact and has also shown the ability to hit for power, driving the ball with authority into the gaps from both sides of the plate. That will only improve as he adds strength to his projectable frame, leading many to project GPE as at least an average hitter with similar power. On the other side of the ball, GPE shows solid infield actions and a decent glove. There's still room for improvement with his footwork on defense, but there's no questioning his arm strength and accuracy. Because of his skill set, GPE projects to be an average fielder and is likely best suited for second base.",-1
"GPE is a strong and athletic middle infielder with the potential to be a special hitter.

"Prior to the 2018 Draft, the earliest a player from PERSON A&M-Corpus PERSON had been drafted was the ninth round. PERSON's path to easily beating that hasn't necessarily been straight. He was academically ineligible as a sophomore, but then came out and showed very good stuff early in the spring. While he wasn't as dominant all year, it was still enough for the ORGANIZATION to take him in the third round and he went straight to the Class A Advanced California League for his full-season debut.PERSON was up to 98 mph at times during his junior season, sitting more in the 92-95 mph range, throwing the pitch with good sink and showing he could maintain his velocity through starts. He has good feel for his secondary stuff and can throw a distinct curve and slider, though they sometimes blur together into a power slurve. He can really spin it and his breaking stuff does flash plus and he has solid tumbling changeup.Though he has swing-and-miss stuff, PERSON didn't dominate in college as much as one would think, as he has trouble commanding his pitches both within and outside the strike zone. With a funky delivery, he might best be suited for the bullpen, but he was given a chance to start at the start of his pro career.",-1
"One of the best two-way players in college baseball, PERSON doubled as a third baseman and closer for a resurgent GPE program the last two years. Though he ranked among the ORGANIZATION Division I saves leaders thanks to an 88-92 mph fastball and an effective slider, pro teams were looking at his value solely as a position player in the GPE. A strong junior season catapulted him into the second round, where the ORGANIZATION gave him just over $1.1 million, full pick value, to sign, then sent him to the short-season LOCATION for his pro debut.PERSON makes consistent line-drive contact from the right side of the plate and improved offensively in each of his three seasons with the ORGANIZATION. He has the strength and bat speed to hit for more power -- he shows at least solid raw pop in batting practice and more than tripled his career home run total as a junior -- but he'll probably top out at 12-15 homers per year unless he adds more loft to his swing. He puts the bat on the ball so easily that he rarely walks, another adjustment he'll have to make as he progresses in his pro career.PERSON has fringy speed out of the batter's box but a quicker first step that helps make him at least a solid defender at third base. He also has soft hands and a strong arm, though he needs to improve his defensive consistency. If everything comes together, he could be a .270 hitter with 20 homers who's an asset at the hot corner.",-1
"Finding college pitchers with both track record and unreached potential is a rarity. But that's exactly what the ORGANIZATION think they might have found in PERSON, their fourth-round pick in the 2018 Draft. A converted shortstop who didn't pitch much until later in his amateur career, PERSON spent most of his first two years at ORGANIZATION pitching out of the bullpen. He made a successful move to the rotation as a junior and has kept on looking like a future starter in his year-plus with the ORGANIZATION.PERSON stands out because of his athleticism, his live and fresh arm and his upside. He commands his low-90s fastball well, allowing it to play up, and he complements it well with his solid changeup, his best secondary offering. He also mixes in a breaking ball that's still developing, but has the chance to give him three usable pitches.Thanks to his ability to repeat his delivery, PERSON has been a strike-throwing machine. There could be more to unlock here, which would allow him to reach a ceiling as a back-end starter.",-1
"Ranked No. 25 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 international prospects for the 2016-17 signing period, the ORGANIZATION thought highly enough of his skills behind and at the plate to give the ORGANIZATION catcher $3.53 million to sign him in July 2016. He made a solid, albeit unspectacular pro debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2017, then was one of the prospects declared a free agent as a penalty for PERSON's international rules violations. The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $550,000 once the prospects were eligible to sign with a new organization.PERSON is a defense-first backstop, one who can really catch and throw. The teenager threw out 38 percent of would-be basestealers in the ORGANIZATION in 2017. In addition to his strong arm and quick release, he's a very good receiver with soft hands and knows how to control the game well. His offensive skillset remains a work in progress. He does have potential at the plate, relying on a line-drive approach. He has some strength, with some gap power that could develop. His strike zone discipline has improved and will have to continue to do so as he moves up the ladder.PERSON takes his job behind the plate seriously and will have to maintain his 6-foot-2 frame to keep shining back there. At the very least, he looks like a sure-handed backup. If his bat starts to come, he could be a lot more than that.",-1
"GPE has produced a fair share of GPE talent over the years, with PERSON and PERSON the most recent examples to get taken in the first round (both in 2015). There hasn't been much in the way of middle infielders to come from north of the border, but the ORGANIZATION are hopeful that PERSON, who signed for $1.3 million as a second-round pick, will be the first to reverse that trend. PERSON made his pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, where he tallied six hits in nine at-bats before an oblique injury prematurely ended his season. PERSON might be a bit unpolished, but he has considerable tools and upside. He has a decent approach at the plate for his age and experience level, with a natural feel to hit and good bat speed. There should be some gap power in the future as well, and he should compile plenty of doubles and triples thanks to his plus speed and sharp baserunning. PERSON is capable of making the spectacular play defensively, and while his arm might grade out as average, he can reach back for more when needed and he's usually very accurate. He will struggle at times with the backhand play, but most feel he can stick at short. If not, his tools also would fit nicely at the keystone. PERSON needs to add strength to his athletic frame, but that should come as he matures physically. Having turned 18 not long before the GPE, he'll have plenty of time to fulfill his fairly high ceiling.",-1

"After strong performances with the GPE junior national team had pushed him up ORGANIZATION boards in 2017, ORGANIZATION landed an above-slot $1.3 million signing bonus from the Orioles after they took him the second round. An oblique injury limited him to just two games that summer, and ORGANIZATION struggled at the outset of 2018, hitting .212 with a .524 OPS during his first month in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League. He broke out in the second half, raking at a .358 clip (.913 OPS) over his final 36 contests, and authored a 19-game hit streak along the way. ORGANIZATION has natural feel to hit, demonstrating good bat speed and the ability to hit to all fields from the right side of the plate, albeit with below-average power. He does have some pop to the gaps, however, and should be a consistent source of doubles and triples as he adds strength to his athletic frame. Plus speed might be ORGANIZATION's best tool, and club officials rave about his baserunning instincts. ORGANIZATION's defense and arm have improved considerably in the professional ranks to the point where scouts now view him as an above-average defender who can stick at shortstop. With his slow start and torrid finish, ORGANIZATION arguably was PERSON's most improved prospect in 2018. ORGANIZATION officials are quick to praise infield coordinator PERSON and hitting coordinator PERSON for their role in his development, as they each spent a lot of time working with ORGANIZATION and made him a more confident player overall. He doesn't have a very high ceiling, but the tools and skills are all there for ORGANIZATION to develop into an everyday player.",-1
"As a GPE junior in 2018, PERSON flirted with no-hitters in back-to-back early-season starts against PERSON and PERSON, striking out 14 in each outing. The performances sent his ORGANIZATION stock soaring, though he wasn't nearly as dominant the rest of the way and missed time in March with shoulder tendinitis. After the ORGANIZATION made him their fourth-round pick in June, PERSON averaged 15.3 strikeouts-per-nine during his pro debut in the Class A Short PERSON York-Penn League. PERSON was dealt to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION trade in January 2019.PERSON's best pitch is his fastball, which sits around 91-93 mph and peaks at 95. He uses his 6-foot-6 frame to create good plane and extension, and has some crossfire in his delivery that imparts running life on his heater. His changeup has been more reliable than his slider this spring, with each showing signs of becoming a solid offering when at their best.PERSON is more physical than athletic, and he sometimes struggles to keep his delivery together and locate his pitches where he wants. If he can do a better job of maintaining his velocity into the later innings, improving the consistency of his secondary offerings and commanding his stuff, he could be a No. 3 starter. If not, he might be more of a sixth- or seventh-inning reliever because he lacks an overpowering fastball or a dynamic second pitch.",-1
"GPE (GPE) featured the best hitting prospect/pitching prospect duo in high school baseball. That was confirmed during the first two days of the 2018 Draft, as the ORGANIZATION selected shortstop ORGANIZATION with their first-round pick and then signed him for below slot so as to save money for PERSON, who signed for $2.45 million -- well above his slot's recommended value of $652,900 -- after being taken in the third round. PERSON can work in the low 90s with heavy sink on his two-seam fastball and hit 96 mph with his four-seamer. He has advanced feel for a breaking ball, showing the ability to morph his sharp slider into a bigger-breaking curveball or a harder cutter. He also has a deceptive changeup with tumble that lacks consistency but also can be his best pitch at times.At 6-foot-5 and 220 pounds, PERSON has a frame built for durability and also the room to add some more strength. He's athletic and repeats his delivery well, allowing him to throw strikes, and scouts have long praised his competitive demeanor on the mound.",-1
"Many believe that GPE (GPE) PERSON featured the best hitting prospect/pitching prospect duo in high school baseball in GPE Groshans and PERSON. That was confirmed during the first two days of the 2018 Draft, as the ORGANIZATION selected Groshans with their first-round pick and then signed him for below slot to save money for the TCU-committed PERSON, who signed for $2.45 million -- well above his slot's recommended value of $652,900 -- after being taken in the third round. He made his pro debut alongside Groshans in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON can work in the low 90s with heavy sink on his two-seam fastball and reach back for 96 mph with his four-seamer. He has advanced feel for a breaking ball, showing the ability to morph his sharp slider, which flashes above-average potential, into a bigger-breaking curveball or a harder cutter. He also has a deceptive changeup with tumble that lacks consistency but could be another above-average offering for him once developed. An imposing presence on the mound at 6-foot-5 and 240-plus pounds, PERSON has a frame built for durability and also the room to add some more strength. He's athletic and repeats his delivery well, allowing him to throw strikes, and scouts have long praised his competitive demeanor on the mound.",-1
"A standout in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON impressed scouts with his physicality and power potential while performing well in games. It earned him a ranking as ORGANIZATION's No. 23 international prospect for the 2018-19 international period as well as a $1.45 million bonus from the ORGANIZATION, who signed the GPE infielder on July 2. He made his professional debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2019. PERSON advanced for his age, the 6-foot-1, 195-pound PERSON has grown in the past year and his overall game has improved, too. He has a good approach and already shows feel for finding the barrel, with plus bat speed and some natural leverage to his swing that could make him at least an average hitter. He can already drive the ball out of the ballpark, and he's expected to show more power as he refines his swing mechanics and adds strength to his projectable frame. While he runs well, PERSON is likely to lose a step with physical maturation.On defense, PERSON shows good hands and a good arm as a shortstop, though there's a chance he will end up at third base because of his skill set and his body type. To go along with his physical attributes, PERSON is a competitor who has been praised for his intensity on the field and how he really enjoys playing the game.",-1
"Sometimes a player who enters his ORGANIZATION season as the best player in the class struggles with the pressure and the spotlight. Then there are players like PERSON, who somehow managed to surpass expectations during his junior season at FACILITY after helping the ORGANIZATION win the ORGANIZATION World Series and earning ORGANIZATION Most Outstanding Player honors in the process. He capped things off by being a member of ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION over the summer and kept on rolling on both sides of the ball during the spring, batting .411 with a 1.326 ORGANIZATION and 17 home runs. The performance netted him the prestigious ORGANIZATION and PERSON, and the ORGANIZATION made him the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in the ORGANIZATION before signing him with a record $8.1 million bonus. The switch-hitting backstop is the complete package at and behind the plate. He has an advanced approach at the plate, walking more than he struck out at FACILITY, with the ability to make consistent, hard contact and drive the ball from both sides of the plate. More of a gap-to-gap doubles hitter early in his college career, his over-the-fence power started to show up more during his junior season and should continue to emerge in the pro ranks. PERSON is also outstanding behind the plate, with excellent hands, agility and a very strong throwing arm, and he's even a better runner than some give him credit for. With his all-around skills at a premium position, PERSON has one of the highest ceilings among all prospects and could move quickly through the ORGANIZATION as a result. The last time the ORGANIZATION took a switch-hitting college backstop with their first pick, PERSON, it worked out pretty well.",-1
"Since signing in 2014, GPE has moved methodically through the lower levels of the ORGANIZATION system, one rung at a time. His first taste of full-season ball in 2017 saw him take a huge leap forward, and he finished fourth in the LOCATION League in strikeouts and ninth in GPE has always had a good feel for pitching, and in 2017 everything took a step forward, stuff-wise. While he featured a 90-95 mph fastball previously, he sat more 92-94 mph and touched 95-96 more consistently in 2017. He commands his heater well and throws it with a lot of life, leading to a steady ground-ball rate. His secondary stuff improved as well, with a sharper breaking ball, now a slider. His changeup flashes above-average, with more consistent feel for it. He throws all three for strikes, and the increased sharpness led to a much better strikeout rate.The full season of innings in 2017 allowed GPE to work on his full repertoire and when to use it. With his feel for pitching and improving stuff, GPE certainly has an up arrow next to his name.",-1
"Ever since signing with the Phillies in May 2014, all GPE has done is pitch well. It started with his debut that summer in the ORGANIZATION and continued with his GPE debut in 2015. The next step up to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn PERSON wasn't too much of a challenge, as GPE finished with a sub-3.00 ORGANIZATION and landed among the league leaders in ORGANIZATION. The athletic, albeit a bit undersized, right-hander has the chance to have a solid three-pitch mix. He'll throw his fastball anywhere in the 90-95 mph range and he throws it with a lot of life, inducing ground-ball outs at a very high rate. He'll show an average breaking ball, but it's inconsistent, something he'll have to tighten up as he moves up the ladder. He has a feel for a changeup, which could also be a Major PERSON average offering for him. He tends to be a strike-thrower but does not miss a ton of bats, something that sharper secondary stuff will help.More than anything, GPE needs to get out and pitch and log PERSON innings so he can work on his full repertoire. A full season in a rotation has certainly helped him move in the right direction.",-1
"When PERSON, who signed back in May 2014, finished among the LOCATION League top 10 in strikeouts and ORGANIZATION during his full-season debut in 2017, there was a lot of anticipation over what the right-hander might do for an encore. While he was a little more uneven in some aspects of his performance, his pure stuff excited the ORGANIZATION enough for him to be added to the 40-man roster this past offseason.Pure stuff-wise, PERSON's is as electric as perhaps any prospect's in baseball and when he's locked in, he can be virtually unhittable. He uses his three-pitch mix to miss a lot of bats, striking out 10 per nine innings in his first two years of full-season ball. His fastball now comfortably sits in the 92-94 mph range and he can easily touch 95-96 mph, commanding the pitch well. PERSON also throws it with a ton of movement, getting ground-ball outs at a consistent clip. Both his sharp slider and his changeup flash plus at ORGANIZATION throws a lot of strikes, but he's still learning to harness his premium stuff within the zone, and it was inconsistencies with that which sometimes led to him getting hit in the ORGANIZATION State League. He just needs more development time to iron that out and the ORGANIZATION feel he has the athleticism, aptitude and competitiveness to reach his ceiling as a frontline starter.",-1
"After signing in May 2014 out of the ORGANIZATION, GPE spent a summer in the ORGANIZATION before making his GPE debut in 2015. He threw very well in the ORGANIZATION, leaving the ORGANIZATION very excited to see what the future has in store for the young right-hander.Not the biggest guy in the world at 6-foot-1, he reminds some of fellow ORGANIZATION prospect PERSON, though he's a bit more physical. GPE has the chance to have a solid three-pitch mix, highlighted by a fastball that took a nice jump forward in the ORGANIZATION and now touches 94-95 mph with regularity. While his breaking ball and changeup are behind the fastball, his curve does show flashes of being above average, and he has a good feel for his sinking change. While his command will have to improve, he already has a good feel for the strike zone.Even with his lack of size, GPE's arsenal and feel for pitching have the ORGANIZATION thinking they have a starting pitcher on their hands. It may take some time, but the wait should be worth it.",-1
"There are some exciting things brewing on the mound for the ORGANIZATION at the bottom of the organizational chain. PERSON has electric stuff that screams future frontline starter. Perhaps a half-step behind him is PERSON, whose very strong GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION and follow-up in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in 2016 has the ORGANIZATION excited to see what comes next.PERSON stands out already for his advanced feel for pitching that belies his age to go along with very encouraging steps forward stuff-wise. His fastball has jumped velocity wise, and he'll now throw it in the 90-95 mph range. He throws it with sink to get groundball outs and it's possible there's more in the tank to come. He spins a good breaking ball already and has feel for a changeup, both of which are inconsistent but have the chance to be at least PERSON average. PERSON throws strikes, but can refine his overall command to make his stuff play up even more.While the ORGANIZATION might be cautious with this teenager for the time being, his ability to execute on the mound could allow him to move a bit more quickly as he matures, with a future as a No. 3 type starter a possibility.",-1

"The ORGANIZATION were willing to blow past their bonus pool and incur a heavy tax to sign PERSON, who some scouts considered the top player in the 2014 international signing class, for $2.95 million on his 16th birthday in July. After striking out at a 34.8 percent clip and ranking last among qualified hitters in average (.166) during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON played up to his prospect pedigree last season in the Rookie-level GPE, showing vastly improved hitting ability and power, though he struggled to build on that momentum during his full-season debut in 2017.A right-handed hitter, PERSON has good bat speed and makes hard contact, with plus raw power to his pull side that scouts expect will eventually translate to the whole field. After playing shortstop to begin his career, PERSON has since moved to third base, where he profiles a solid defender with giving hands and a strong arm. He's a below-average runner and stands to lose another step with physical maturation. ORGANIZATION officials were encouraged by PERSON's performance in 2016, noting his overall physical and mental progress, and they expect the youngster to continue making strides as he become more acclimated to pro ball.",-1
"PERSON was considered by some scouts to be the top player in the 2014 international signing class. The ORGANIZATION certainly agreed with that assessment, as they were willing to exceeded their bonus pool and incur a heavy tax to sign the GPE native for $2.95 million on his 16th birthday. He was overmatched in his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, where he struck out in 34.8 percent of his plate appearances and ranked last among qualified hitters with a .166 batting average, but has looked better this season in the Rookie-level Appalachian League.A right-handed hitter, PERSON has good bat speed and makes hard contact, though he struggled to do so consistently in his first taste of pro ball. His power is mostly to the gaps right now but should improve as he physically matures and gains a better feel to hit. PERSON is a solid defender at shortstop, one with giving hands, a strong arm and natural instincts, although his present below-average speed and modest range could make it difficult for him to remain at the position long term.PERSON's lackluster pro debut in the ORGANIZATION highlighted his overall rawness, although too much shouldn't be made of the performance given his age and lack of experience. Meanwhile, club officials are optimistic that he will make strides on both sides of the ball after his challenging campaign the year prior.",-1
"  GPE was considered by some scouts to be the top player in the 2014 international signing class. The ORGANIZATION certainly agreed with that assessment, as they exceeded their bonus pool, triggering a heavy tax, to sign the GPE native on his 16th birthday. GPE has fluid actions on offense and defense, and he never seems out of control. He makes solid contact and has gap-to-gap power that should improve as he physically matures. He has a good approach at the plate and shined during ORGANIZATION League games before signing. Defensively, GPE projects to stay at shortstop. He's a solid defender with a strong arm, quick feet and natural baseball instincts.GPE is advanced for his age and he's already given evaluators reason to be excited about the kind of player he could become and the ORGANIZATION felt comfortable enough to skip him over the ORGANIZATION and send him to the GPE and the ORGANIZATION for his pro debut.",-1
"A three-year starter at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, PERSON was a glove-first shortstop who didn't hit much in his first two years with the ORGANIZATION. The son of longtime big leaguer PERSON, ORGANIZATION swung the bat better as a junior, though he missed a chunk of the 2018 season with a hamstring injury. The ORGANIZATION took him in the eighth round last June and went above pick value to sign him for $300,000. He responded with a strong pro debut, spent mostly in the full-season LOCATION, but could build off of that as he got hurt on opening day of 2019 and missed the rest of the season.When healthy, PERSON's calling card is still his defense, and he has the same quick hands as his father, who used to play the infield in the big leagues for parts of 13 seasons. At times, PERSON makes errors because he tries to speed up too much, something that will change once he trusts that his hands are plenty quick enough for the pro game. He has the range, footwork and arm to play shortstop long-term. He has the chance to be an average hitter with some sneaky pop and the ability to make consistent contact. He has an unorthodox setup at the plate, and he'll likely have to fix an issue with the load on his swing, but it's worked for him so far.After PERSON got worn down by the end of the summer, he worked hard to add some strength to his frame to prepare him for the rigors of a full season before the injury bug hit. The ORGANIZATION are eager to see how his baseball acumen and bloodlines help him along the way once he regains health.",-1
"Since 2013, spanning the last five Drafts, a total of 11 outfielders from the ORGANIZATION high school ranks have been taken in the top two rounds. PERSON was the last of four to be selected in 2016, though he didn't start making any noise until the 2017 season. PERSON got bigger and stronger between his pro debut and first full year and did a lot of damage in the rookie-level GPE League as a result.In addition to his added strength, PERSON brought a much better approach to the plate with him in 2017. He walked more than he struck out and that should drive his hit tool, which some feel will eventually be plus. Though he's still not the biggest guy in the world, he makes loud contact and has gap power, pop that should translate into more balls over the fence as he matures. He's an above-average to plus runner who has the chance to develop into a solid basestealer. While his arm is below-average, it isn't a hindrance, and he's played more center field than anywhere else as a pro. He'll keep playing up the middle in 2018, but will also see time in the corners for versatility as an average defender overall.Full-season ball will be a good challenge to see if the 2017 PERSON is the real deal. The Twins believe in the hit tool and even if he ends up in a corner, he could fit the offensive profile quite well once he's done maturing.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION went aggressively after high school hitters at the top of the 2016 Draft, with their first four selections being prep position players. PERSON was the last of the quartet, taken in the ORGANIZATION B and starting his pro career that summer in the ORGANIZATION. The toolsy outfielder went back there in 2017 and played his way to the GPE League in a big step forward, then after struggling out of the gate during his full-season debut in 2018, played very well down the stretch in the ORGANIZATION. He was trying to get going in the ORGANIZATION State League in 2019 when an elbow injury in May required PERSON surgery.More than anything, it seems that PERSON took a while to adjust to the cold climate in GPE Rapids at the start of the 2018 season and his bat warmed up as the weather did. He continued to show elite-level walk rates, he finished fourth in the league in free passes last year, and though his strikeout rate also jumped up, he made much more consistent contact in the second half. His extra-base authority continues to show up more and he could approach average power when all is said and done. He also has outstanding speed, which allows him to steal bases, not to mention leg out the league-leading 11 triples he had in '18.His wheels also serve him well in the outfield, where the ORGANIZATION have more confidence in his ability to play center field long-term. He made strides there and in strengthening his arm, and is now looking more and more like an up-the-middle big league regular.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION had back-to-back picks in the ORGANIZATION, the second of which came as a result of their inability to come to terms with PERSON right-hander PERSON. They used the pick to take PERSON, an athletic outfielder from the ORGANIZATION high school ranks who, ironically, was signed away from his commitment to PERSON.PERSON has an intriguing power/speed combination and put both to more consistent use as a high school senior. Using a loose, whippy left-handed swing, PERSON has plenty of bat speed to spare. Strides with his overall approach give hope he will hit for both power and average in the future. His plus speed makes him a basestealing threat and if everything clicks, he has 20-20 potential. While PERSON has the speed to play center, some feel he lacks the instincts to stay there. His arm is below-average, so that could mean left field long-term, and the ORGANIZATION were having him play corner spots during his pro debut. That puts more pressure on his offense, but there were scouts who felt he'd profile just fine there.",-1
"A solid prospect in high school in GPE, PERSON didn't get drafted in 2016 and went on to PERSON. After a nondescript freshman year, spent almost entirely in relief, PERSON took a nice step forward as a sophomore with the ORGANIZATION. He then threw well during a brief stint in the ORGANIZATION last summer and that carried over to his junior season, where he raised his profile as ORGANIZATION's Friday night starter. The ORGANIZATION, who went heavy after college arms in 2018, did it again in 2019, with PERSON being the first of six college pitchers taken in the top 10 rounds. The right-hander got full pick value in ORGANIZATION B and threw well during his pro debut in the rookie-level PERSON League.PERSON has four pitches, all of which he can throw for strikes. While he'll typically sit around 92 mph, he can get his fastball up to 96 mph consistently and throws his heater with solid cut and sink. His slider, thrown 78-83 mph, is better than his curve, thrown with more power and with the ability to land it in the strike zone and then out of the zone to get hitters to chase. He has feel for a changeup as well.In addition to having four pitches which could all be PERSON average when all is said and done, scouts love the way PERSON competes on the mound. Some see a slightly better version than area standout PERSON, a third-round pick of the ORGANIZATION out of GPE Canyon in 2018, with a bit better command and the potential to be a No. 4 starter at the highest level.",-1
"Signed out of GPE in 2016, PERSON appeared in only one game during his professional debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League after he re-aggravated a hand injury that he initially suffered in a car accident. PERSON healthy in 2018, PERSON established himself as a legitimate prospect by hitting .354/.443/.558 with 10 home runs and 57 GPE over 58 games in the Rookie-level GPE. PERSON ranked among the ORGANIZATION leaders in a host of categories, as he finished third in average, fourth in GPE (.443) and slugging (.558) and tied for first in GPE. Employing a direct and impactful swing, PERSON has natural hitting ability and above-average raw power to his pull side. He got to it during games consistently in 2018, though he's expected to be more of a hit-over-power guy as he moves through the Minors. Scouts like PERSON's chances of becoming at least an average hitter, in part because he controls the strike zone so well, as evidenced by the 33/21 BB/K ratio he posted in 2018.Listed at 5-foot-9, 220 pounds, PERSON isn't particularly athletic, nor does he run well. He's a good blocker, though, and earns praise for his solid arm strength and catch-and-throw skills that helped him throw out 43 percent of attempted basestealers in 2018. PERSON will need to make a slew of improvements to stay behind the plate, but there are some scouts who believe he'll do just that, viewing him as a potential bat-first regular.",-1
"PERSON was a two-way player out of high school in the GPE area in 2016 but went undrafted and headed to LOCATION. The big right-hander worked more out of the bullpen than in the rotation over his first two seasons but opened a lot of eyes as a starter in the ORGANIZATION, leading the circuit in strikeouts. He's been that pitcher ever since and shot up ORGANIZATION boards with a dominant junior season for the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION took PERSON with the ORGANIZATION. 11 overall pick, making him the second pitcher to come off the board in the 2019 ORGANIZATION. A physical beast at 6-foot-6, 260-pounds, PERSON has always shown glimpses of solid power stuff, but without consistency or command of it. That changed this spring as he showed above-average control for most of his junior season. He typically sits in the 94-97 mph range with his fastball, missing a ton of bats thanks to good sink. His slider flashes plus at times and has been a more reliable weapon for him. He has a solid changeup, on which he relied in the ORGANIZATION championship game, but he didn't use it as much during the spring.PERSON has managed to keep his large frame in sync and has repeated his delivery in order to fill up the strike zone more effectively. Given that he doesn't have that many starts on his resume, he's a rare college pitcher with projection. With three pitches, power stuff and natural strike-throwing ability, PERSON has all the ingredients needed to become an impactful Major League starter.",-1
"The son of FACILITY director of strength and conditioning PERSON, PERSON grew up around the game and was a three-sport star at ORGANIZATION in GPE. The D-backs were thrilled to find PERSON still on the board for them in the second round and signed him away from a ORGANIZATION commitment with a $1.2 million bonus, just above pick value, helping cushion the blow of not signing first-round pick PERSON. After an impressive pro debut across two levels, PERSON made the jump Class A Kane County for his first full season and garnered All-Star honors in the ORGANIZATION before representing the D-backs in the ORGANIZATION in July. PERSON has proved to be one of the best prep hitters from his GPE class. He sends line drives to all fields with his compact left-handed stroke, impressive bat speed and mature approach at the plate. Though he's not very physical, his feel for the barrel and sneaky pop should produce at least 12-15 homers per year, not to mention plenty of doubles and triples. PERSON enhances his plus speed with good instincts on the bases and in center field. While he has below-average arm strength, it's playable in center field.More polished than the average high school pick, PERSON could move relatively quickly through the Minors now that he's focused on baseball. His game earns him comparisons to the likes of PERSON and PERSON, though PERSON is more advanced at the same stage of their careers.",-1

"â¢ PERSON to miss season after PERSON high school baseball scene isn't generally thought of as a hotbed for talent, though good players do emanate from LOCATION. PERSON brought scouts to the GPE all spring in 2016, landing in the middle of the first round to the ORGANIZATION, the first high schooler from the area to go that high since PERSON was taken by the ORGANIZATION back in 2003. PERSON hit over .300 during his pro debut and was named the GPE League Player of the Year. His first full season was over before it started, however, when it was announced in early March that he needed PERSON surgery.Once he returns, PERSON has the chance to hit for both average and power from the left side of the plate. He has a knack for barreling the ball consistently, driving the ball to all fields, with more over-the-fence pop to come as he matures. A center fielder and a pitcher in high school, PERSON is athletic for his size. While he did see some time in center during his pro debut, he will most likely move to right field, where his offensive profile should profile well. He has played first base as well and could move there if needed in the future.The elbow injury first occurred at the end of his ORGANIZATION season and the organization thought it just would require rest and rehab, but the symptoms returned when he tried to throw this spring. The ORGANIZATION will have to wait to see what he can do over the course of a full season.",-1
"After the PERSON took PERSON from the ORGANIZATION area high school ranks in the middle of the first round of the 2015 Draft, he went out and won PERSON of the Year honors. A sore left elbow shut him down late that summer and led to PERSON surgery the next spring, ending his first full season before it began.Healthy again, PERSON can get back to showing off his outstanding hit tool from the left side of the plate. He has an innate ability to barrel up the baseball consistently and can drive it to all fields. There should be plenty of over-the-fence power as he matures, though he is more hit over power at present. ORGANIZATION for his size, PERSON played center field and pitched in high school, and he saw some time in center during his pro debut. That said, PERSON profiles best in right field. If his elbow doesn't come all the way back, he has shown he can play a solid first base defensively.The PERSON will finally get to see what PERSON can do over the course of a full season. Expectations might be muted a bit initially as he will have some rust to shake off, but the bat has the chance to be special.",-1
"A strong summer showcase circuit showing put PERSON, a product of the LOCATION high school ranks, firmly on the map for the 2016 Draft. He kept on hitting during his senior season in the ORGANIZATION area, cementing his place as one of the best high school bats in the class. The ORGANIZATION took him No. 15 overall and gave him a full pick value bonus of $2,817,100, the highest a ORGANIZATION prepster has gone since PERSON went in the first round in 2003.While there is a little length to his swing, he's shown the ability to barrel the ball consistently and has considerable raw power. He's more athletic than one would think given his size and played center field for his high school team. While he played some center during his pro debut, he'll likely be a corner outfielder in the future. He moves more than well enough to stay there. He has a strong arm, one that fired 87-90 mph fastballs from the mound.PERSON should fit the offensive profile for an everyday corner outfielder, one who could provide power and run production for a big league lineup in the future.",-1
"PERSON was one of the better pure hitters in the 2016 Draft class, taken by the Twins in the middle of the first round out of ORGANIZATION outside of GPE. After a strong summer debut in the Rookie-level GPE, however, the outfielder needed PERSON surgery and missed all of 2017. There was uncertainty about how he would bounce back after the injury and long layoff, but PERSON responded by earning a promotion, going to the ORGANIZATION and leading the Minors in total bases while finishing third in average and seventh in RBIs.If it weren't for PERSON phenom PERSON, a strong argument can be made that PERSON is the best hitter in the ORGANIZATION. He makes consistent, hard contact and can drive the ball to all fields. He has over-the-fence power the other way and also showed he can turn on pitches when needed, while making a seamless transition up to the pitching-friendly PERSON. He's a sound and consistent right fielder, one who makes all the plays and can stay there long-term with an average arm. He might mix in some first base, where some think he could be a plus defender, to add some positional flexibility.That's more about making sure there's a spot for him when his bat is deemed ready, which might not be too far off in the future. He's already gained a lot of strength; the Twins are excited to see what he can do now that he's completely off of his rehab protocol and doesn't have to rediscover his timing after a year off.",-1
"ORGANIZATION established himself as one of the top LOCATION college performers in the 2018 Draft with a strong performance in the ORGANIZATION last summer. He burnished that reputation by winning Big West Conference player of the year honors this spring, batting .339/.424/.506 at ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION selected him in the fourth round and signed him for $430,000.ORGANIZATION has a disciplined approach and peppers line drives from gap to gap. His bat speed and strength create solid raw power, though his right-handed stroke is fairly flat and has yet to yield many home runs. He's a solid runner with savvy on the bases but not a prime basestealing threat. A center fielder in college, ORGANIZATION's quickness and instincts give him solid range in the outfield. He'll have to prove that he can remain in center as a pro, and if he can't, his average arm should allow him to play in either left or right field. If he has to move to a corner, he'll have to show more in-game power to profile as a regular.",-1
"GPE's 2017 PERSON of the Year, PERSON went 15-0 with a 0.73 ERA at ORGANIZATION, throwing one perfect game and three other no-hitters. Though he had a first-round-caliber arm, concerns about his signability as well as playing for three high schools in four years dropped him to the fifth round. The ORGANIZATION signed him away from a Texas A&M commitment for $700,000, which was more than twice the assigned slot value but less than most clubs figured it would take.After pitching with a high-80s fastball as a rising junior in the summer of 2015, PERSON saw his fastball jump to 93-95 mph the following spring. He showed the same heat and topped out at 98 mph in 2017, maintaining his velocity late into games. He attributes the boost to better conditioning, as his fastball soared once he dropped 40 pounds from his 6-foot-3 frame.PERSON pairs his fastball with one of the better changeups in the 2017 high school class, delivering it with deceptive arm speed and fade. His breaking pitches aren't as impressive, with his slider grading better than his curveball and showing the potential to become an average offering. He throws a reasonable amount of strikes but doesn't have the smoothest delivery, leading some scouts to project him as a reliever in the long run.",-1
"PERSON had an outstanding 2017 senior season at GSP (GPE) PERSON, going 15-0 with a 0.73 ORGANIZATION and four no-hitters to capture PERSON state player of the year honors. He showcased a first-round arm but worries about his signability and his history of playing for three high schools in four years dropped him all the way to the fifth round. The ORGANIZATION signed him for $700,000, more than twice the assigned slot value but less than most clubs figured he would accept, then had him focus on strengthening his shoulder rather than pitching in game action during the summer.After improving his conditioning and losing 40 pounds, PERSON saw his fastball rise from the upper 80s in the summer of 2015 to the mid-90s a year later, topping out at 98 mph. As he has adjusted to pitching every fifth day in pro ball, he worked at 92-93 mph before straining his oblique in June. He also had one of the best changeups in the 2017 Draft, selling it with deceptive arm speed and creating nice fade.PERSON's breaking pitches aren't as advanced, and GPE has had him shelve his slider to focus on his curveball. While he has a durable frame and throws strikes, his less-than-smooth delivery and lack of a present third pitch lead some scouts to project him as a reliever. He'd be a late-inning option if he moved to the bullpen.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION have had success taking high-risk, high-reward prospects and reaping the benefits of those who pan out. They went that route again in the second round of the 2016 Draft when they selected PERSON, who unquestionably had a first-round arm but slid because he has trouble harnessing it. He turned down a scholarship from GPE to sign for $1,024,900.PERSON draws comparisons to PERSON because of his raw stuff and his lanky, athletic frame. His 92-96 mph fastball explodes on hitters with riding life and should add more velocity as he gets stronger. His hard curveball gives him a second potential out pitch.He's not anywhere as close to polished as PERSON was at the same stage of his career, however. PERSON has trouble locating the strike zone, and the action on his fastball and the depth on his curveball don't make that task any easier. He'll need to do a better job of repeating his delivery and refine his changeup to make it as a starter.",-1
"PERSON exemplifies the ORGANIZATION' high-risk, high-reward approach to acquiring amateur talent. He had one of the best pure arms in the 2016 Draft but lasted 63 picks because he rarely could harness it, and PERSON invested a $1,024,900 bonus to see if it could help him reach his lofty ceiling. He had little success as a pro starter before beginning to make progress after moving to the bullpen last summer, only to see his career put on hold when he required PERSON surgery this June.PERSON has an explosive 92-96 mph fastball that already pushes triple digits and has riding life, and he could throw harder if he adds more muscle to his lanky frame. He also can show a wipeout breaking ball with curveball depth and slider velocity, though he has difficulty landing it in the strike zone. He has little experience throwing a changeup and figures to scrap it if he winds up in the bullpen.His athleticism and clean arm action should help him throw strikes, but PERSON has trouble keeping all of the moving parts in his delivery in sync. He has the ceiling of a frontline starter or closer but also the floor of a guy who can't pitch his way past Double-A. When he returns from having his elbow reconstructed, his ability to land his pitches in the zone will determine if he can deliver on his upside.",-1
"PERSON unquestionably had first-round stuff but his difficulty harnessing it helped drop him to the second round of the 2016 Draft. A classic high-risk, high-reward Rangers sign, he turned down an GPE scholarship to turn pro for $1,024,900. PERSON held him to 8 1/3 innings in his pro debut, and he showed off both his bat-missing ability and his wildness with 11 strikeouts and seven walks.It may seem like blasphemy, but PERSON' pure stuff, lanky frame and impressive athleticism earn him comparisons to PERSON. He pitches at 92-96 mph and reaches 99 with a fastball that explodes on hitters with its riding action, and he could pick up more velocity as he develops physically. He also can overpower hitters with a hard curveball but can't always land it for strikes.While PERSON dominated big leaguers at age 19, PERSON is trying to figure things out in short-season ball at the same stage of his career. He has a clean delivery but still is learning to repeat it, and his changeup is still in its rudimentary stages. He gets so much life on his fastball and depth on his curveball that it makes controlling his potential out pitches that much harder.",-1

That performance put him on the A's radar, and they acquired him and reliever PERSON in November in exchange for PERSON, further adding to the organization's glut of promising young shortstops. Evaluators believe PERSON has the potential to stick at shortstop. He's an athletic and instinctual defender with good actions and the plus arm strength needed for the position. PERSON' above-average speed translates on both sides of the ball, though he has gains to make as a baserunner. At the plate, the right-handed hitter is short to the ball and has good feel for the barrel, resulting in lots of line drives and some gap power, and he already has shown on-base skills -- he recorded more walks (41) than strikeouts (39) in his pro debut - thanks to an advanced approach.PERSON has started to grow into his athletic frame since signing and should continue to tack on good strength. His defense-speed combination at an up-the-middle position gives him a possible floor as a big league reserve, though further progress at the plate could very well thrust him into the conversation as an everyday player.",-1

"Signed for just $60,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2016, PERSON ranked second in the ORGANIZATION with 26 extra-base hits and won ORGANIZATION honors in the ORGANIZATION circuit's all-star game during his pro debut the following year. He came to the GPE in 2018 and continued to show solid all-around potential while becoming a full-time center fielder. PERSON has electric bat speed that's the best in the ORGANIZATION system. He's still maturing at the plate, as his right-handed swing can get overly long when he swings for the fences rather than letting his power come naturally. He generates high exit velocities and displays the patience to draw walks, though he won't take off until he focuses on making more consistent contact. After playing mostly right field in his debut, PERSON made a nice transition to center last summer. ORGANIZATION officials think he'll be able to stay there if he continues to hone his reads and routes. Should he slow a bit as he develops physically, his solid arm and offensive upside definitely fit the profile in right.",-1
"Though he signed for a mere $60,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2016 and has yet to make his GPE debut, GPE already has emerged as one of the higher-ceilinged prospects in the system. He broke into pro ball by ranking second in extra-base hits (26), third in GPE (45) and fourth in total bases (109) in the ORGANIZATION and was named ORGANIZATION of the Rookie-level circuit's All-Star Game.GPE has electric bat speed from the right side of the plate and can catch up to any fastball. He has a knack for making consistent hard contact and the patience to draw walks. While his home run potential currently shows up more during batting practice than in games, he could develop at least average power once he adds some much-needed strength.Currently a plus runner who's aggressive on the bases, GPE figures to lose a step once he fills out. He spent most of his first year in pro ball as a right fielder and has the solid arm strength for the position. If he retains much of his present quickness, he has a chance to play center field after seeing brief action there in his debut.",-1
"GPE wasn't a high-profile international signing, garnering a $60,000 when he turned pro out of the ORGANIZATION in July 2016. He has yet to make his GPE debut but already has emerged as one of the more intriguing prospects in the ORGANIZATION system. He ranked second in extra-base hits (26), third in GPE (45) and fourth in total bases (109) in the ORGANIZATION in his first taste of pro ball, also capturing ORGANIZATION honors in the Rookie-level circuit's all-star game.A right-handed hitter, GPE shows a penchant for making consistent hard contact and some patience to draw walks. While his home run potential is more evident during batting practice than in game action, he could develop average power once he adds some much-needed strength to his slender frame. He's currently a plus runner who's aggressive on the bases, though he figures to lose a step once he matures physically.If GPE retains much of his present speed, he has a chance to play center field. He spent most of his pro debut in right field and has the solid arm strength desired at that position. If his bat develops like PERSON hopes, he could be a legitimate five-tool player.",-1
"PERSON was one of the youngest players in the 2018-19 international amateur class, one who didn't turn 16 until late August. Ranked No. 28 on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 international prospects list, he got a $1 million bonus from the ORGANIZATION and made his pro debut in 2019 in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON is an athletic outfielder with intriguing tools. The right-handed hitter has shown a good setup and approach at the plate, with the chance to eventually be an average, if not better, hitter in the future. Some evaluators put a 70 on his raw power and he will eventually learn to translate that consistently into game action. An average runner with solid defensive instincts, PERSON began his pro career in center field, but most feel he'll slow down a tick as he matures and move to an outfield corner.The good news is that he has the chance to fit the right field profile well, one who will be an above-average defender there with a solid arm to go along with the run-producing skills teams covet from that spot. PERSON will be key as ORGANIZATION fans aren't likely to see PERSON stateside until 2020.",-1
"The last player the ORGANIZATION signed in their 2015-16 international class, PERSON was nearly 19 when he turned pro for $14,000 in May 2016. A GPE, he spent most of his first three seasons in GPE ball before holding his own in an all-prospect rotation at low Class A Charleston in 2019. While he's still a work in progress, his stuff has taken a leap forward and could make him a No. 3 starter if he reaches his ceiling.PERSON has added some velocity to his fastball this season, typically operating at 94-98 mph and peaking at 100. His changeup can be equally devastating, arriving in the low 90s with splitter action. He lacked a reliable breaking ball in the past but has increased the spin rate on his low-80s curveball, which shows some signs of becoming a solid offering. PERSON is throwing more strikes than he has in the past, but his ability to refine his command will determine whether he winds up as a starter or reliever. If he can continue to improve at the same rate he has from 2018 to 2019, he could start to advance quickly.",-1
"While the Brewers have given big money to a slew of 16-year-old, up-the-middle prospects in recent years, PERSON was signed at age 19 for just $10,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in February 2018. He made his pro debut that year in the ORGANIZATION, then moved stateside for his GPE debut in 2019, flashing an arsenal of promising pitches in the Rookie-level PERSON. PERSON is a bit older than the typical recently-signed international prospect, but the wiry right-hander has plenty of physical projection remaining in his 6-foot-2, 170-pound frame. His fastball can touch 95 mph and sits around 92-93, and he's already shown an ability to hold that velocity early in his career. His heater plays up because he gets good extension to the plate. His upper-70s curveball with top-to-bottom action is his go-to secondary offering, and he shows some feel for throwing a changeup that he'll need to further develop as he moves through the ORGANIZATION. PERSON uncoils from his delivery but controls his body surprisingly well, all things considered. Both his control and command have a ways to go, but there's a lot to like about the right-hander's potential to develop three Major League-caliber offerings.",-1
"Signed for $690,000 out of GPE at the start of the 2013 signing period, PERSON has become one of the top catching prospects in the ORGANIZATION' system. Part of that is because others have graduated, but part is also because of how far his game has come in a short time.PERSON made his GPE debut in 2015 and performed well, particularly behind the plate. No one runs on him, with a strong arm and a quick release leading to him throwing out 48 percent of would-be basestealers in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON is athletic and agile behind the plate, with soft hands and good blocking skills, showing an ability to work with pitchers that often doesn't come until later in development. He has tools to hit, with a solid approach and an understanding of what he still needs to work on. PERSON's swing is contact-oriented now, but there should be power to come as he adds strength.Just 19 for all of the 2016 season, PERSON still has a ways to go, particularly offensively. But with a floor of a very good backup and a ceiling of an everyday big league backstop, the ORGANIZATION are eager to help him get there.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION gave PERSON $690,000 to sign out of GPE in July 2013 hoping he would develop into a solid all-around, if a bit defensive-minded, catcher. The defense has definitely been there, but the bat has been slow to come, and his first taste of full-season ball in '17 ended in late July with a broken hamate. Healthy in '18, PERSON showed improved hitting ability and even a little bit of power, splitting his season between Class A Columbia and ORGANIZATION Class A St. Lucie. PERSON is an exceptional defensive catcher by all standards. He's a plus receiver who blocks well and already calls a good game, with plus-plus arm strength and similar catch-and-throw skills that enabled him to throw out 42 percent of attempted basestealers in 2018 -- bringing his career caught-stealing rate to just under 47 percent. As a hitter, PERSON has decent contact skills and doesn't strike out a lot, but he also doesn't impact the ball as consistently as one would hope based on his bat-to-ball abilities. Defensive-minded backups don't have to hit a ton, but they do have to show some ability to handle the bat to get there. PERSON did a better job of that in 2018, and the ORGANIZATION believe he'll continue to make improvements with experience.",-1
"Typically young catchers, especially teenagers signed at age 16, are either offensively or defensively-minded early in their career. The ORGANIZATION are particularly excited about PERSON, signed for $690,000 out of GPE in 2013, because he has excelled at the plate and in the field.PERSON is advanced well beyond his years both at the plate and behind it. He receives well and controls the running game, thanks to a solid arm and very quick release. He's athletic and moves well behind the plate. He has a better approach at the plate than normally seen from an 18-year-old, limiting strikeouts and showing a willingness to take walks. He uses the whole field and has strength, with some power likely to come as he advances.PERSON made his GPE debut in 2015, playing as well as he did during his organizational debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2014. The ORGANIZATION could have a very exciting all-around catching prospect on their hands.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION were encouraged with how PERSON, who signed in July 2013 for $690,000 out of GPE, began his pro career, playing well in both his 2014 pro debut in the ORGANIZATION as well as in his GPE debut in 2015 in the ORGANIZATION. A move up to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in 2016 did not go as well, leaving it clear PERSON has a lot work to do, especially as a hitter.The ORGANIZATION are willing to give PERSON a bit of a mulligan, knowing it can take catchers longer to develop and that PERSON was just 19 last year. He showed some of the same contact skills that served him well early on, with a decent approach at the plate; he just wasn't able to drive the ball at all, lacking the strength to do so. He needs to work on his direction to the ball and learn to attack it. Defensively, there's a lot more that's working right now. PERSON has a plus arm that has thrown out around half of all would-be basestealers in his career. He's developed a lot in terms of his game-calling and his overall receiving skills.The ORGANIZATION know better than to give up on catching prospects because there's so much more that goes into their development. PERSON will be just 20 years old for all of 2017 and there's plenty of time for him to develop as an all-around backstop. PERSON case, he has the chops to be a very good defensive backup.",-1

The defense has definitely been there, but the bat has been slow to come and his first taste of full-season ball in 2017 ended in late July with a broken hamate.There are absolutely no questions about PERSON's ability to defend. He is a plus receiver who blocks well and already calls a good game. His cannon of an arm has enabled him to throw out 48.5 percent of potential basestealers in his pro career heading into 2018. The 21-year-old is way behind at the plate. He does have decent contact skills and doesn't strike out a lot, but has absolutely no power to speak of and after posting solid batting averages in the ORGANIZATION and PERSON in 2014 and 2015, he hasn't been able to replicate those results and doesn't show much of a feel to hit right now.Defensive-minded backups don't have to hit a ton, but they do have to show some abilty to handle the bat to get there. PERSON's work behind the plate is so special, the ORGANIZATION will be extra patient in letting his skills in the batter's box develop.",-1
" | Overall:45One of the better all-around prospects in GPE, PERSON was ranked No. 19 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 International prospects list heading into this year's July 2 signing period. The ORGANIZATION liked him enough to give him $1 million, the largest bonus they handed out to an international prospect this summer.PERSON's hands and strong arm stand out the most among his tools. He has solid defensive actions and should get every chance to stick at shortstop even though he has just average speed. Some scouts do think a move to third is in his future, where he could be an outstanding defender. A switch-hitter, he does have work to do at the plate, with a need to clean up his hitting mechanics. He has shown the ability to make consistent contact with some authority, though he might not be a big home run guy.PERSON has been compared at times to former ORGANIZATION shortstop PERSON. The ORGANIZATION would be thrilled with that outcome, an infielder who spent parts of 16 years in the big leagues.",-1
"When organizations sign young pitchers, the hope is there will be growth into the kind of pitcher they ultimately can become. With PERSON, who was ORGANIZATION's No. 15 prospect on the Top 30 ORGANIZATION list heading into the July 2015 signing period and signed for $762,500, it's been quite literal. The right-hander was 5-foot-8 at the time he signed, but now stands at 6-foot or 6-foot-1.The Cardinals, of course, were excited about PERSON' stuff from the get-go, regardless of the size of the package it came from. He'll throw his fastball in the 92-95 mph range while still learning to create movement on a consistent basis, along with fastball command. His secondary stuff is progressing, starting with a curveball that could be above-average in time, a pitch PERSON has confidence in throwing at any point in thte count. His changeup is behind, but there's some feel for it to work with. The teenager is around the strike zone and should get to average control in the future.PERSON has become stronger and more durable as he's grown, with a loose, flexible and athletic delivery. He pitches with confidence, something that should only grow as he moves up the ladder and learns the nuances of his craft.",-1
"Ranked No. 15 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list heading into the July 2015 signing perioid, the ORGANIZATION gave the right-hander $762,500 to sign. PERSON made his pro and GPE debut in 2016, jumping from the ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION and showing a feel for pitching that belies his tender age.PERSON might be small in stature, but there's nothing small about his arm. He pitched typically in the low-90s and touched 94-95 mph during his debut, and there could be more in the tank as his athletic frame fills out. PERSON showed flashes of a solid curveball and the makings of a changeup, but like with many young pitchers, there's work to be done with that. For a 17-year-old pitching professionally for the first time, he impressed with his advanced feel for his pitches and what he needs to do on the mound, likely aided from having trained with PERSON in his academy in GPE. That will only increase as PERSON grows up.It's possible to dream in any number of directions with PERSON. He could be an undersized yet athletic starter with electric stuff, or his stuff could really play up in shorter stints as a lights-out reliever. PERSON will get every chance to start for the time being.",-1
"PERSON signed for $900,000 out of the ORGANIZATION, getting the largest bonus in the FACILITY's 2014-15 international class. More advanced than most of GPE's international bonus babies, he made his GPE debut at age 17 in 2015 but played in just 21 games because of hamstring issues. He stayed healthy and topped the Rookie-level PERSON with 62 hits when he returned there last summer.Though PERSON is still raw offensively, the tools are there to hit for some average and power from the right side of the plate. He already shows a propensity for using the opposite field and has enough strength and bat speed for 12-15 homers per year once he starts turning and lifting pitches more frequently. He's in the process of figuring out pitch recognition and plate discipline.Most scouts thoughts PERSON would lack the quickness and range for shortstop once he's physically mature, and the FACILITY moved him to third base in 2017. He's presently an average runner with nice hands and a strong arm, but he led ORGANIZATION shortstops with 30 errors in 41 games last year. His bat will profile at the hot corner if it develops like GPE expects it will.",-1
"The highest-priced member of the GPE's 2014 international class, PERSON signed for $900,000 out of the ORGANIZATION. The FACILITY considered him advanced enough to bring him to the GPE for his pro debut at age 17 this year.While PERSON doesn't have an obvious standout tool, he doesn't have a glaring weakness. He has a sound right-handed swing, good bat speed and an advanced approach. He could develop into a hitter who produces solid batting averages and on-base percentages with 12-15 homers per year.PERSON isn't a flashy defender at shortstop, though he has reliable hands and his arm plays up because of his quick release. If he loses a step as his 6-foot-2 frame fills out, he'll probably have to move to third base.",-1
"PERSON commanded the largest bonus in the FACILITY' 2014 international class, signing for $900,000 out of the ORGANIZATION. PERSON believed he was advanced enough to come to the GPE for his pro debut at age 17 in 2015, though he never really got untracked while battling hamstring problems. He was faring much better in a return to the Rookie-level PERSON this summer.While PERSON lacks an obvious plus tool, he has a chance to be close to average across the board. He has a quick right-handed bat and has a good grasp of the strike zone and feel for using the entire field for a teenager. He has more power potential than the typical middle infielder, with a chance to hit 12-15 homers per year once he gains strength.Though he needs to slow the game down on defense after making 10 errors in 21 games in the Rookie-level PERSON, PERSON has reliable hands and an arm that plays up because of his quick release. He has good instincts but may have to move to third base if he loses a step off his average speed after he matures physically.",-1
"PERSON PERSON wasn't the only potential star the ORGANIZATION signed during the 2014-15 international signing period. They believed PERSON was the best pitcher available on the amateur market when they paid him $1.8 million, doubling the ORGANIZATION bonus record PERSON had set in 1998. He proved better than initially expected during his 2015 pro debut, advancing to low Class A at age 17 and reaching 100 mph with his fastball. But it will now be up to the ORGANIZATION to further the youngster's development after they acquired him from PERSON for PERSON during the 2016 All-Star break. Because of PERSON's small stature, big stuff and precocious command, he draws some extreme comparisons to PERSON. With little effort in his delivery, he usually works at 94-97 mph with his fastball. Both PERSON's tight curveball and sinking changeup are more advanced than those of the typical teenager, showing the potential to become plus pitches.PERSON repeats his mechanics well, which allows him to put his pitches where he wants. The only question at this point is whether his slight build will allow him to hold up over the course of a long season. PERSON carefully managed his workload early in his career, and that's likely to remain the case as a member of the ORGANIZATION.",-1
"Even before they gave PERSON $31.5 million, the ORGANIZATION already had blown well past their bonus pool for the 2014-15 international signing period. They previously landed the top two pitchers on the market, spending $1.8 million on PERSON and $1.5 million on GPE righty PERSON. PERSON's bonus doubled the previous record for a ORGANIZATION set by PERSON in 1998.PERSON may stand just 6 feet and 165 pounds, but his small stature belies big-time stuff. He already can reach the upper 90s with his fastball and shows the ability to spin a tight curveball. He displays feel for a sinking changeup as well, giving him the three pitches needed to start.PERSON has advanced pitchability, too, repeating his delivery and throwing strikes much more easily than a typical 17-year-old. He's so precocious that he needed only four starts in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION to persuade GPE that he was ready to make his GPE debut.",-1
"PERSON was signed by GPE for $1.8 million during the 2014-15 international signing period, a record for a ORGANIZATION prospect, doubling the amount that PERSON received in 1998. His immediate success against full-season competition caught the ORGANIZATION' attention, and they acquired him for PERSON during the 2016 All-Star break. But PERSON's 2017 season was over before it began, as he opened the year on the disabled list with right forearm tightness before undergoing PERSON surgery in GPE. He had worked his way back and seemed poised to return in earnest early in the 2019 season before it was announced that he underwent a second PERSON surgery in April. Though he may be small in stature, there's nothing diminutive about PERSON's stuff when healthy. His smooth delivery and lightning-quick arm produce a heater that can touch triple digits, though he typically works in the 94-95 mph range with late movement. PERSON's curveball shows plus potential but lacks consistency at times in 2016, while his changeup, thrown with fastball-like arm action as well as considerable sink, gives him a true chance for three plus pitches. Beyond the stuff, PERSON repeats his mechanics well and demonstrates advanced control and command for a hurler his age.With PERSON's second TJ surgery comes yet another setback in his once promising career. He'll still be 22 when he returns in 2020, but he also hasn't thrown a competitive pitch since '16, and has never pitched above the Class A level. On top of that, the right-hander will forever face questions about his durability, and it's only to fair to wonder whether he might be ticketed for a bullpen role upon his return.",-1

"The ORGANIZATION had to wait patiently until GPE's 16th birthday to sign him, which they did for $900,000 in August 2013. He impressed as a 17-year-old during his stateside debut in 2015, showcasing a promising blend of hitting ability and raw power, but was limited to just 24 games the following year due to a back injury. PERSON healthy in 2017, GPE has already turned in his longest season to date while playing for Class A Hagerstown.GPE is already loaded with upper-body strength and has plenty of room left to grow into his athletic and projectable frame. The right-handed hitter has a quick bat and generates good power to his pull side, and club officials believe he'll have at least average over-the-fence pop once fully developed. His issues with recognizing spin speak to his youth and inexperience, but the overall approach is advanced for his age and offers a solid foundation for offensive growth.After playing third base exclusively during the 2015-16 seasons, GPE has seen increased time at first base this season, partly to ensure that he stays healthy. He has the makings of an average defender at both corner infield spots, with agility, range and a strong arm.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION believe they landed one of the top players in the 2013 international free agent class in GPE, who signed for $900,000 on his 16th birthday. Making his stateside debut last year at age 17, the ORGANIZATION third baseman showcased an intriguing blend of hitting ability and raw power in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League before finishing the season with a brief taste of the Class A Short PERSON York-Penn League.Though already a physical specimen with tremendous upper-body strength, PERSON is just beginning to grow into his projectable frame. He has a quick bat and generates good power to his pull side, the combination of which could lead to at least average over-the-fence pop down the road. His pitch-recognition issues highlight his youth and inexperience, but the overall approach is advanced for his age and offers a solid foundation for offensive development.GPE split his time between third base and shortstop during his debut before moving to the hot corner full time in 2015. He has the makings of an above-average defender there, with the agility, range and strong arm needed to stick at the position long term.",-1
"  Among the top players in the 2013 international free agent class, GPE was one of the youngest and had to wait until his 16th birthday in GPE to sign with the Nationals. He was again one of the youngest players the next year in the ORGANIZATION, where he made his professional debut.Despite his youth, GPE earns praise for his makeup and baseball IQ, while his physical build and strength help him in all facets of the game. He generates good bat speed and raw power, though he's still learning to tap into it in games. His swing is a little long, but with some fine tuning he should be able to consistently make hard contact.GPE split his time between third base and shortstop during his debut, but his size means he'll likely settle at the hot corner.

"Signed for $100,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2014, PERSON created trade interest with other clubs almost as soon as he made his GPE debut two years later. He tied for the Rookie-level PERSON lead with six triples in only 32 games and ranked fourth in the short-season LOCATION with eight homers in just 23 contests, a tantalizing power display for an 18-year-old middle infielder. Pitchers exploited his free-swinging ways when he first got to low Class A in 2017 before he settled down and batted .280/.336/.460 in the second half.Though he's just 5-foot-11, PERSON has wiry strength that combines with his quick hands to give him plus raw power. He's learning that he doesn't have to sell out for home runs, and when he does his whippy left-handed swing gets too long and he piles up strikeouts and harmless flyballs. If he develops more patience and uses the entire field, he could hit for a decent average while still hitting 15-20 homers on an annual basis.PERSON has more than enough arm for shortstop but his speed and range are average, so it's unclear if he'll stay at the position. He's too young to move yet, though he did see extensive action at second base last year and has played sporadically at third base in the past.

He finished the year with 34 extra-base hits in 66 games, an impressive showing for an 18-year-old.PERSON has surprising power for someone listed at 5-foot-11, generating easy plus raw pop from the left side of the plate thanks to his quick hands and wiry strength. His whippy stroke has considerable bat speed and he has some natural hitting ability, giving him the chance to hit for a solid average as he matures. To do so, he'll have to quiet his approach, tighten his strike zone and use the opposite field more often.It's unclear whether PERSON will remain at shortstop. He has a plus arm but his range and speed are closer to average, and he'll need to improve his consistency. Because GPE has several young shortstop prospects, he'll also get time at second and third base, and his bat has a chance to be special and profile wherever he plays.",-1
"Other teams started asking about PERSON in trade talks as soon as he made his GPE debut in 2016. Signed for $100,000 out of the ORGANIZATION Republic two years earlier, he immediately demonstrated enticing power potential for a middle infielder. He ranked second in total bases (205) and fifth in homers (19) as a 20-year-old in the Class A Advanced PERSON last year, though his 2019 season ended in last May when he injured his non-throwing shoulder while sliding into a base.PERSON stands just 5-foot-11, but his combination of wiry strength, whippy swing and bat speed could develop into plus power. To get all the way there, he'll have to improve as a hitter, because he still gets too aggressive and pull-happy instead of letting his home runs come naturally. A natural left-handed hitter who has scuffled against southpaws in pro ball, he resumed switch-hitting in 2019 after previously batting from both sides as an amateur.PERSON significantly upgraded his defensive profile last season, erasing any doubts that he could stay at shortstop. Though he's an average runner, he has improved his instincts and range. His plus-plus arm allows him to make throws and plays that many shortstops can't.",-1
"Signed for $100,000 out of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON spent his first pro season in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION and returned there to start 2016 before coming to the GPE and breaking out. He tied for the Rookie-level PERSON lead with six triples in just 32 games and before tying for fourth in the short-season LOCATION with eight homers in just 23 contests. All the more impressive, he was only 18 years old.PERSON has easy plus raw power from the left side of the plate and more home run upside than most middle infielders. He has quick hands and surprising strength for someone listed at 5-foot-11 and 160 pounds. In order to hit for average at higher levels, he'll need to tighten his strike zone and do a better job of using the entire field.PERSON has average speed and solid arm strength, and the ORGANIZATION believe he can stay at shortstop if he works on his defense. He also has seen action at second and third base, and he could profile offensively at both positions.",-1
"In three years at ORGANIZATION, PERSON went from focusing solely on making contact to trying to get the most out of his raw power while moving from first base as a freshman to shortstop as a sophomore before settling in at the hot corner as a junior. After hitting eight total home runs during his first two season, PERSON doubled his combined total as a junior, slugging 16 homers in 56 games for the ORGANIZATION while maintaining his feel to hit and on-base skills. The ORGANIZATION made him their third-round pick in June, and PERSON began his pro career in the Class A ORGANIZATION. PERSON has good hand-eye coordination, controls the strike zone extremely well and makes consistent contact from the right side of the plate. He turned his stroke loose more often during his junior campaign, but continued to walk nearly as much as he has struck out while producing more power. He's a well below-average runner who can clock some bottom-of-the-scale times down the line when he takes a big swing.Though he lacks quickness, PERSON has good reactions at third base and should be at least an adequate defender with more experience there. His reliable hands and solid arm strength fit at the hot corner, as does his offensive profile. First base is probably his only other option in pro ball because his speed would make him a liability on an outfield corner.",-1
"As a high school junior in 2015, GPE helped PERSON win the ORGANIZATION, then went on to join the GPE pitching staff. After a freshman season spent largely in the bullpen, he jumped on the national radar as a sophomore All-American starter. He kept on performing as a junior as the ORGANIZATION' Friday night starter and signed for slot value after the ORGANIZATION selected him in the fourth round of the 2019 Draft.While he's not the prototypical starting pitcher in terms of height, the 6-foot right-hander does have a lot of arm speed and strength. And he's worked hard to turn himself into more of a pitcher compared to the thrower he was earlier in his amateur career. He can still go get 96-97 mph at times, but is more comfortable sitting in the 91-94 range with a fastball that has cutting and some sinking action to it. He throws both a slider and a curve, and while the former might be a tick ahead of the latter, some feel he might be better served focusing on the curve to differentiate from his fastball more. He sells a future average changeup well and knows how to pitch backwards when needed.While GPE doesn't have the cleanest arm action, with a little stab in the back, he repeats his delivery well and tends to be in sync, leading to a lot of strikes. That gives him the chance to stick in a rotation long-term, with the ceiling of a No. 4 type starter.",-1
"Ranked No. 19 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list heading into the July 2015 signing period, PERSON received $1.2 million from the ORGANIZATION to sign out of Venezuela.PERSON reminds some in the organization of fellow ORGANIZATION shortstop PERSON in terms of his maturity and feel for the game at such a young age. He has a good feel for hitting with a line-drive approach. PERSON is quick to the ball and makes consistent hard contact, showing an ability to drive the ball to the gaps. While he's only 5-foot-11, he has some strength and bat speed, and it's not out of the question that he'll develop some power in the future. PERSON is a very smooth fielder, potentially a touch better than PERSON, with excellent hands, actions and plenty of arm. He runs well, which gives him ample range and should allow him to be an excellent baserunner. PERSON is just getting started in pro ball and will be 17 for all of the 2016 season. For a system deep in shortstop prospects, he gives them one more with a ton of upside.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION have never shied away from pushing young infielders up the organizational ladder if they felt they could handle the challenge, with players like ORGANIZATION and PERSON making their big league debuts at age 21 in recent years. PERSON, who signed in July 2015 for $1.2 million and made it to Double-A in 2018 before he turned 20, appears to be on a similar path.PERSON might be among the most unassuming-looking top prospects in the game given his small frame, but he has tools on both sides of the ball. He can flat-out play shortstop, and should be able to play there long-term thanks to his strong arm, excellent hands, range and plus instincts for the position. While he's not a burner, he has above-average speed, and he maximizes it both defensively and as a hitter, leading the organization in stolen bases in 2018. He has a very good approach at the plate that leads to consistent contact, and he's shown he's not afraid to draw a walk. He may never win a home run derby, but the 2018 Futures PERSON showed more extra-base thump in '18, with a bit more to come.In another system, PERSON would be the heir apparent at shortstop. With PERSON there in the big leagues, PERSON got a lot of time at second base in the ORGANIZATION last fall, perhaps a sign of things to come.",-1
"When teams acquire young international talent, as the ORGANIZATION did by giving PERSON $1.2 million to sign in July 2015, it often comes with the understanding that while the raw tools might be plentiful, it might take time for them to be refined and the player to mature. When a teenager shows tremendous skills and beyond-his-years maturity, that's when an organization thinks it might have someone special. And that's how the ORGANIZATION feel about PERSON.During his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, the ORGANIZATION shortstop finished second in batting average and third in ORGANIZATION, and the ORGANIZATION feel the numbers are legit. That's largely because of his advanced approach, one that saw him walk twice as often as he struck out in 2016. The left-handed hitter has plus bat speed with the chance to be a 60 hitter when all is said and done. While he's never going to have a ton of power, he's not a slap hitter, either. PERSON is definitely a shortstop long-term, using his above-average athleticism and speed well in the field as well as on the basepaths.While PERSON might not be the pure tool package that PERSON is, he has the chance to be a really good up-the-middle player. Because of his off-the-charts makeup, the ORGANIZATION felt comfortable pushing him and he had a solid GPE debut in the full-season LOCATION League in 2017 at age 18.",-1
"Ranked No. 19 on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 international prospects list in 2015, PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION that July for $1.2 million. His pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, where the infielder led the circuit in on-base percentage and finished second in batting average and third in ORGANIZATION, gave the ORGANIZATION confidence to leap him all the way up to the full-season LOCATION for his GPE debut in 2017. He more than held his own as one of the youngest position players in the league.PERSON has an advanced approach at the plate that belies his age and experience. He works counts and draws walks while making consistent hard contact with a simple and quick swing from the left side of the plate. PERSON needs to continue to add strength, and while over-the-fence power will likely never be a huge part of his game, he should mature into impacting the ball more with extra-base authority, eventually becoming a plus hitter. He has above-average speed at present, which helps him on the basepaths and in the field. He has the arm, hands and range to play shortstop long-term and his makeup should allow him to maximize his tools.Now on a faster track because of the aggressive promotion in 2017, PERSON's skills and maturity should allow him to keep streaking up the system. The ORGANIZATION obviously have Amed PERSON at short in GPE, and while the organization doesn't have to worry about it just yet, no one worries about PERSON's ability to slide to second base if needed.",-1
"Before reversing course this June, the FACILITY had shied away from taking high school arms with early picks since drafting PERSON in 2014's second round. They grabbed GPE right-hander PERSON in the second round and doubled down with PERSON in the third, signing them for a combined $4.1 million. One of the few pleasant surprises in a down LOCATION prep class, he landed a $2 million bonus. PERSON viewed PERSON as a projectable right-hander with a nice delivery but not enough present stuff to buy him away from an GPE commitment until his fastball jumped to 91-95 mph during his senior season. He uses four-seamers at the top of the strike zone and two-seamers at the bottom, with his extension creating deception that's more notable than the life on his heater. He has a lot of projection remaining in his 6-foot-1 frame and could continue to add more velocity.PERSON gets good depth on a mid-70s curveball that should become a solid offering once he adds more power. He also has a slider and changeup but didn't use them much as an amateur. He's athletic and possesses a whippy arm action that allows him to fill the strike zone.",-1
"PERSON went from an unheralded northern GPE high schooler to the best hitter in college baseball during his three years at GPE, batting .374/.495/.688 with 50 homers in 160 games. The ORGANIZATION winner as a sophomore in 2018, he surpassed PERSON as the highest drafted player in GPE history when the FACILITY took him No. 3 overall this June. He signed for $7,221,200, a GPE record for both the franchise and for a corner bat.PERSON has a sweet right-handed swing, plenty of bat speed and strength and no discernible flaws at the plate. He's a natural hitter with natural power to all fields and he doesn't try to do too much. He uses the entire field and won't chase pitches when opponents try to work around him, and he could be a .300 hitter with 30 homers and 80 walks on an annual basis.Though PERSON worked out at third base for some clubs before the GPE, he likely will be limited to first base. He's a below-average runner but moves well enough around the bag. He does have some arm strength and ran his fastball into the low 90s when he pitched early in his college career, but the majority of his value -- and it will be considerable -- will come from his bat.",-1
"Signed as a teenager in October 2013, the switch-hitting PERSON didn't start getting really noticed until a robust 2017 in the ORGANIZATION when he slashed .345/.390/.472 in 62 games. A hamstring issue really hampered him during his full-season debut with PERSON in 2018, though he did make some good strides in the second half.A very lean kid listed at 170 pounds, PERSON has some surprising 50-60 level raw power on the 20-to-80 scouting scale and ran into some balls last year that left the ballpark quickly. He has shown solid bat-to-ball skills from both sides of the plate, though he was much better from the left side, where he also has more extra-base ability. Although his leg injury compromised his best tool, he is an above average base runner with speed that makes him a basestealing threat. PERSON can also cover a lot of ground in the outfield. Not an instinctive defender, he has the arm for the corner spots but could still hold his own as a center fielder.It remains to be seen if PERSON's 6-foot-2 frame can support more weight and muscle, but he somehow needs to find more strength to take advantage of his raw power ability. With his offensive skills, he projects as a fourth outfielder.",-1
"PERSON, a native of GPE, really put himself firmly on the map during the ORGANIZATION home run derby held over the 2015 All-Star Game weekend in GPE, advancing to the finals and getting to swing with the Major Leaguers in the main event on Monday. PERSON's annual tour through GPE this spring gave PERSON the chance to raise his stock, and he took advantage, landing in the second round and getting full pick value -- $1,214,100 -- to sign with the D-backs.PERSON's left-handed power is what stands out the most, as he consistently squares up the baseball. He's more power than hit, but it's easy power, and while he may never hit for a high average, the home run pop should play in games. His play behind the plate is a bit more crude. He has an average arm that's accurate, even though he needs to improve his footwork. His hands work decently, and he should become an adequate overall receiver in time.The D-backs let PERSON jump over the rookie-level ORGANIZATION to go to the ORGANIZATION for his debut, where he was teaming up to make a very good catching trio with fellow 2016 draftee PERSON and ORGANIZATION prospect PERSON.",-1
"Developing catching can be a tough task for any farm system. Helping a high school catcher reach his potential? That can be an even longer process, especially when that young backstop comes from a cold-weather climate like GPE. But the D-backs' scouting staff liked PERSON's left-handed power bat enough to take him in the second round and preach patience to the player development staff.They are more than willing, especially given PERSON's plus work ethic and makeup. He's strong with good bat speed and has the makings of a good swing that should continue to evolve. He's more power over hit currently and will improve as he incorporates his lower half more, refines his approach and improve his pitch recognition. PERSON's defense is a work in progress -- he committed 20 passed balls during his pro debut -- though he made strides during his first summer and at instructs last fall. His average arm should be playable, especially as he continues to improve his footwork and release.The D-backs knew it would be a long game to get PERSON headed in the right direction defensively, but with the improvements they've seen already, there is no reason to move him from behind the plate, with the hope being he becomes an offensive-minded big league regular behind the plate.",-1
"When the D-backs took PERSON in the second round of the 2016 Draft out of the GPE high school ranks, they were excited to bring his power potential into the organization and knew it might take time for the other parts of his game to develop, especially behind the plate. True to projections, PERSON's bat is starting to show up, and then some. Now it's a question of whether his catching can keep up.After struggling during his pro debut in 2016, PERSON showed the ability to make adjustments, see pitches and start tapping into his considerable raw power. He drew walks and drove the ball to all fields in the ORGANIZATION in 2017 and if that continues, his plus raw power will show up more consistently in games. Defensively, PERSON has solid arm strength, and has thrown out just over 30 percent of potential basestealers in his young career heading into 2018, but his receiving, blocking and game-calling still have a ways to go.The D-backs are pleased with the strides he's made defensively and he reported to Spring Training with a transformed body, looking much leaner and more athletic. If that helps him behind the plate, then PERSON could develop into the big league regular catcher, albeit a bat-first one, the D-backs envisioned.",-1
"Seven of the ORGANIZATION' eight most expensive signings on the 2018 international market were shortstops, no surprise for an organization that stockpiles middle infielders every year. That group included PERSON, whose father PERSON caught for eight years in the big leagues. Signed for $500,000 out of the ORGANIZATION, he has impressed in his pro debut in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION in 2019.Though PERSON will need time to add strength and to develop, he's a switch-hitter with intriguing offensive potential. He has a sound, quick swing from both sides of the plate and uses a mature approach. He could grow into solid raw power once he matures physically, giving him more pop than most of GPE's infield prospects. It's evident that PERSON grew up around the game because his instincts allow him to play quicker than his average speed on the bases and in the field. With his solid arm strength, he's capable of playing anywhere in the infield. He has divided his first pro season among second base, third base and shortstop while PERSON (who signed for $2.1 million) gets most of the ORGANIZATION reps at short.",-1
"An unheralded international prospect when the ORGANIZATION signed him out of the ORGANIZATION in January 2016, PERSON spent his first two pro seasons in GPE ball before finally getting his first full-season exposure with PERSON in 2018. He's done nothing but excel since then, showing improved stuff while making a relatively quick climb through the ORGANIZATION' system. He broke out in earnest in 2019, earning midseason All-Star honors in the ORGANIZATION State League before advancing to Double-A in mid-May. While PERSON has long shown a loose, quick arm, his stuff has really begun to tick up as he's added strength to his durable frame. He generates easy velocity, sitting 92-94 mph and bumping 95 in most outings, and is a candidate to add a few more ticks based on his remaining physical projection. His hard slider, while above average, can be inconsistent, at times featuring more curveball-like action than true slider bite, but it's still a very effective pitch for him that should continue to improve. His changeup, much like his breaking ball, is a bit of a work-in-progress, though he does impart good diving action on that pitch. He generates a healthy number of whiffs both inside and out of the zone, especially with his fastball-slider pairing, and consistently avoids hitters' barrels.To go along with his improving stuff, PERSON also has proved a workhorse early in his career and pitches deep into games. He shouldn't have any problems sticking as a starter, provided he can make gains with control and command and continue to refine his secondary arsenal, and it's almost a given that PERSON's stuff would play up in shorter bursts should the ORGANIZATION ever move him to the bullpen.",-1
"At 6-foot-5 and 204 pounds, PERSON was one of the most physically imposing players on the 2017 international market when he signed for $500,000 as a 16-year-old Dominican that July. His body and reputation grew in his first year in pro ball, as he added 25 pounds and topped the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League with 10 homers last summer.A switch-hitter, PERSON is more effective left-handed but his gargantuan raw power is obvious from either side of the plate. He has an extremely aggressive approach and a naturally long swing, which resulted in a 41 percent strikeout rate during his pro debut. While it's easy to dream on his bat speed and strength, he's going to have to make much more contact to deliver on his power potential. Though PERSON moves surprisingly well for his size, he already has lost a step since signing and could slow further if he continues to get bigger. He could become an average defender on either outfield corner if he works diligently on his defense and maintains his current athleticism. His arm earns average to solid grades from evaluators.",-1
"PERSON's notoriety as a switch-hitter and switch-pitcher who could throw in the upper 80s with equal effectiveness with either arm sometimes overshadowed the fact that he was one of the best catchers in the 2018 Draft. GPE made him the first prep backstop selected, signing him for $2,815,900 as the 23rd overall pick. If he reaches the big leagues, he'll join PERSON as the only members of the ORGANIZATION to do so.The ORGANIZATION often prioritize slugging over hitting ability and defense at catcher, but PERSON doesn't fit their usual profile. He's extremely athletic for his position and could develop into a ORGANIZATION behind the plate. He has promising receiving and framing potential, and his plus arm plays even better because he has such a quick transfer.A proficient hitter from both sides of the plate, PERSON controls the strike zone and drills line drives to all fields. He has a contact-oriented approach with solid bat speed, and while he's not loaded with raw power, he has the hitting ability to get the most out of what he has. He's close to an average runner and has good instincts on the bases and in all phases of the game.",-1
"PERSON attracts attention because he's a switch-hitter as well as a switch-pitcher who can throw in the upper 80s and is equally effective with either arm. However, his ambidextriousness isn't as significant as his considerable all-around ability as a catcher. The ORGANIZATION made him the first high school backstop selected in the 2018 Draft, signing him for $2,815,900 as the 23rd overall pick.Proficient from both sides of the plate, PERSON consistently makes hard contact and uses the entire field. He needs to get stronger but his hitting ability and solid bat speed eventually should translate into double-digit home run totals. With close to average speed, he's faster than most catchers and shows good instincts on the bases and in all phases of the game.Agile behind the plate, PERSON has promising receiving and framing skills. He has a quick transfer that helps his arm play as plus at times. PERSON athletic for his position, he elicits comparisons to PERSON and could profile as an everyday player at second base if desired.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, GPE) featured one of the best position player/pitcher combinations in the 2019 Draft, though both PERSON and right-hander PERSON came with strong commitments to ORGANIZATION and high price tags. The ORGANIZATION selected them both, signing PERSON for $2,740,300 as the 30th overall pick and taking a fruitless 20th-round flier on Leiter. While some clubs rated PERSON as a second-rounder because he lacks a true plus tool, GPE saw him as a worthy first-rounder who combines a chance to be a solid hitter and defender with a high baseball IQ.PERSON demonstrates nice feel for the barrel, using a compact right-handed swing to drill lines drives to all fields. He does have the bat speed to grow into double-digit home run power once he gets stronger, though he understands his priorities are to make contact and get on base. He got a little quicker as a high school senior, flashing plus speed at times and continuing to show good instincts on the bases.Though PERSON's range and arm don't dazzle at shortstop, he makes all the plays. He positions himself well and has soft, quick hands that help him get rid of the ball quickly. PERSON adore his makeup and have no doubts that he'll get everything he can out of his physical ability.",-1
"PERSON was a late popup before the 2018 Draft as an Illinois high schooler, impressing scouts enough with his size and projectability that the ORGANIZATION made a run at signing him to an over-slot bonus in the 13th round. He chose instead to attend PERSON (Ill.) CC, where he led national ORGANIZATION pitchers with 19.1 strikeouts per nine innings. While some teams passed over PERSON due to the sizable gap between his ceiling and floor, the Brewers were thrilled to find him still on the board in the second round and signed him for slot value. PERSON's fastball topped out in the low 90s as a high school senior, but after adding 20 pounds and cleaning up his delivery, he's reaching 98 mph and showing the ability to work at 94-97 mph for innings at a time. PERSON look at his 6-foot-6 frame and how easy and loose his arm looks while pumping mid-90s heat, and many of them come up with the same physical comparison: a young PERSON. He still has room to add more strength and to further improve his mechanics, so it's easy to project him topping 100 mph in the future.The quality of PERSON's secondary arsenal lags behind his heater. His mid-80s slider is below average and he struggles to land it for strikes, but the Brewers like the pitch's action and believe it'll improve as he develops better feel. His changeup is non-existent and will be an area of focus in pro ball. His control is surprisingly good for a hurler with such long levers, and it's easy to envision him making further gains on that front given his fluid delivery. PERSON's development will require a ton of patience and he ultimately may be more of a reliever than a starter, but he has a rare arm.",-1
"GPE gave seven-figure bonuses to three Venezuelans in 2017: catcher PERSON ($3.1 million), who died of cancer four months later; and infielders GPE ($1.4 million) and PERSON ($1.6 million), who quickly emerged as two of the best position prospects in a rebuilding farm system. GPE was advanced enough offensively and defensively to make his GPE debut at age 17 last summer, though he missed six weeks after straining his left shoulder on a swing. One rival club told the ORGANIZATION Sox they considered him the best prospect in the organization.With a controlled but quick right-handed swing and an advanced approach for a teenager, GPE should hit for a high average. He controls the strike zone and employs the entire field, and his hitting ability and deceptive strength give him the chance to develop 20-homer power. While he's only an average runner and could lose a half-step as he matures physically, he has good instincts on the bases.GPE also shows nice savvy in the field, where he covers more ground at shortstop than his speed might suggest. He's a fluid defender with soft hands and the arm strength to make all the required throws at short. In the event he slows down and requires a shift to third base, he has the offensive potential to profile there.",-1
"One of three Venezuelans to receive seven-figure signing bonuses from the ORGANIZATION in 2017, GPE turned pro for $1.4 million. He's no relation to PERSON, who died of cancer four months after signing for $3.1 million. His tools are fairly similar to those of C.J. PERSON's, GPE's top shortstop prospect, though GPE is much further away from the big leagues.Though GPE receives more praise for his instincts than his tools, he has the ability to contribute both offensively and defensively. He has good actions at shortstop, where his savvy allows him to cover more ground than his fringy speed would suggest. He has the arm strength for the position, though he needs to be mindful not to drop his arm slot and lose accuracy on his throws.With a nice right-handed swing and signs of an advanced approach, GPE should hit for average. He's not very physical but has some loft in his stroke and should develop some gap power once he gets stronger. He won't be a basestealer, but runs the bases well.",-1
"After the ORGANIZATION missed out in the ORGANIZATION sweepstakes, they used their surplus international bonus pool money to land PERSON ($1.85 million) and PERSON ($1.35 million) last December. PERSON and signed as a catcher, PERSON had unusual tools for the position and moved to center field for his pro debut. He needed just a week in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION to persuade the ORGANIZATION that he was ready to come to the GPE, where he has thrived in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League.Based on the early returns, PERSON's bat could play almost anywhere on the diamond. He's advanced in terms of his patience, plate discipline and ability to make repeated contact. He offers promising power potential as well thanks to his bat speed and strength, and he should hit more home runs once he adds some loft to his right-handed swing.PERSON's best tool is his speed, which earns 65-70 grades on the 20-80 scouting scale, and his worst is his fringy-to-average arm. As a result, GPE deemed him a better fit in center field than behind the plate. He's still in the early learning stages in the outfield, but once he improves his reads and hones his instincts, he should be at least an average defender in center.",-1
"When the ORGANIZATION failed to sign PERSON after the 2017 season, they regrouped and spent their surplus international money on GPE position players Raimfer GPE ($1.85 million) and PERSON ($1.35 million) in December. PERSON and signed as a catcher, PERSON had atypical athleticism for the position and moved to center field before his 2018 pro debut. He showed enough in one week in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION for GPE to decide he needed a tougher challenge and to bring him to the GPE at age 17.PERSON has advanced discipline and bat-to-ball skills for a teenager. His bat speed and strength also give him plenty of raw power, which translated into him topping the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League with a .555 slugging percentage. He should develop even more pop as he adds more loft to his right-handed swing.PERSON's speed earns well-above-average grades from some evaluators, a major factor in the ORGANIZATION' decision to move him from behind the plate. He's still learning as a center fielder but should become at least an average defender once he improves his reads and routes. He has average arm strength and enough offensive ability to profile as a regular if he has to shift to a corner.",-1
" The most electric arm in the state of GPE for the 2015 Draft, PERSON didn't show a ton of feel for harnessing his stuff until late in the season. It was enough for the ORGANIZATION to take him in the second round and sign him away from GPE with a bonus slightly above pick value.PERSON has a strong 6-foot-3, 240-pound frame and a very quick arm, and when he keeps his mechanics under control he looks like a future ace. PERSON can work at 93-95 mph fastball and hit 98, with some late life when he keeps it down in the zone. His curveball can be a true 12-to-6 hammer and reach the mid-80s. The problem is that PERSON can't hold his delivery together, often flying open and overthrowing. That causes his fastball to straighten out and his curve to lose its shape, and prevents him from keeping either pitch near the strike zone. He has yet to show much aptitude for throwing a changeup.",-1
"The best prospect from the ORGANIZATION' spending spree during the 2015-16 international signing period, PERSON landed a $2 million bonus out of the ORGANIZATION. He made his pro debut last summer in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION, where he hit .254/.366/.316 with more walks (34) than strikeouts (28). He stood out by showing more polish than a typical 17-year-old. An advanced left-handed hitter with a mature approach, PERSON already recognizes pitches well and uses the whole field. He lacks size and strength but understands his limitations, focusing on stroking line drives and not worrying about driving the ball. With his hitting ability and bat speed, he could grow into double-digit home run power while providing high batting averages and on-base percentages. PERSON has solid speed and already shows some savvy on the bases. He has good instincts in the field as well and should be able to stay at shortstop. He's not the flashiest defender, but his feet, hands and arm all work well.",-1
"GPE invested heavily in the international market during the 2015-16 signing period, with PERSON receiving the third-largest bonus in its crop at $2 million. Extremely mature for his age, the ORGANIZATION made his full-season debut last August at 18 and didn't look out of place in the low Class A ORGANIZATION. While he may not have as high a ceiling as former top PERSON infield prospects PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, he still offers plenty of upside and has a high floor.Despite his struggles in high Class A this year, PERSON is an advanced hitter who already recognizes pitches, uses the whole field and doesn't try to do too much. He makes repeated contact, drilling line drives to all fields while managing the strike zone well. Though he lacks size, he has a quick left-handed swing and some sneaky power that could translate into 12-15 homers annually once he adds some muscle.PERSON has average speed but plays quicker than that on the bases and in the field because of his instincts. He's still learning as a basestealer but already shows a propensity for making plays at shortstop. His hands, range and arm are all solid and should allow him to play a variety of positions if needed.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION ranked second behind only the ORGANIZATION in international spending during the 2015-16 signing period, handing out $16.4 million in bonuses. The best player from that crop is PERSON, who landed a $2 million bonus out of the ORGANIZATION. His maturity has led GPE to push him aggressively, and while he was able to handle low Class A at age 18 in 2017, he scuffled as the youngest regular in the high Class A ORGANIZATION last year.Though he batted just .207/.291/.273 in 2018, PERSON still displayed an efficient left-handed swing and an advanced approach. He recognizes pitches well and uses the entire field, though his rough season demonstrated his need to add strength. He won't ever be a slugger but needs more muscle in order to reach his potential as an above-average hitter with some occasional pull power.PERSON's instincts allow him to play above his average speed on the bases and in the field. He has a good internal clock at shortstop, as well as the solid hands, range and arm to make plays there. His tools should allow him to play second base and third base if he needs to fill a utility role, though he should hit enough to be a regular if he gets the chance to catch his breath.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION shelled out $900,000 to sign GPE out of GPE in July 2014 when he was ranked No. 15 on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list. There wasn't much to show for the investment, at least not offensively, over his first two summers of pro ball, but particularly at the end of his first taste of full-season ball in 2017, things started to click.The ORGANIZATION never doubted GPE's ability and were more than willing to be patient for his considerable tools to start showing up. It didn't help that the start of his 2017 season was delayed by a hamstring injury, but he did start swinging the bat well over the last month and change of the year. He's starting to add strength, with more to come, and that combined with his bat speed should allow him to impact the baseball from both sides of the plate. He makes all the plays at shortstop, where he will be able to play long-term, with a plus arm.In terms of raw tools, GPE rates higher than rookie shortstop J.P. Crawford and might end up with similar offensive tools to those of PERSON. He's a long way away from reaching that ceiling, but the ORGANIZATION are confident he's starting to figure it out.",-1
"PERSON was thought to be one of the best shortstops in the 2014-15 international signing class, ranking No. 15 overall on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list at the time. The ORGANIZATION signed him for $900,000 that July and have watched him shine defensively and show glimpses with the bat, though far from consistently. Despite the offensive issues, the ORGANIZATION thought enough of his toolset to add him to the 40-man roster following the 2018 season.Though he has yet to show it for any extended period of time, PERSON has provided flashes of being able to do everything well while playing a premium position. His defense is definitely still his calling card, and he'll show off his plus arm and above-average range at times, looking smooth and flashy at one moment, then out of sync at other times. He has average raw power from both sides of the plate but hasn't come close to tapping into it with a contact-first approach. He does have the bat speed to eventually develop into an average hitter.PERSON is one of the most enigmatic prospects in the system. Based on raw ability, he might be considered a top 10 prospect. Based on production, he's not there, but the organization is willing to be patient to figure out the puzzle.",-1
"When the high school season began back in 2017, PERSON was a bit of an unknown quantity because he had missed the previous summer after tearing his left ORGANIZATION and meniscus that May. A big senior season in GPE sent him soaring up ORGANIZATION boards and the A's were even more confident his tools would play after a pre-ORGANIZATION workout, so they nabbed him with the ORGANIZATION. 6 overall pick and gave him a franchise-record $5,303,000 to sign. His pro debut that summer was uneven, at best, but he turned in a solid full-season debut in 2018 as a ORGANIZATION All-Star.PERSON's tools are undeniable, though he is still learning to use them consistently on the field. While he hit close to .300 in 2018 and led his league in hits, he still needs to refine his overall approach to see more pitches and work counts more effectively. He does have the bat speed that should allow him to continue to hit for average, while that improved approach should allow him to tap into his very good raw power more than he's been able to so far in his brief pro career.With excellent speed and athleticism, PERSON has the skills to play center field, the only spot he's manned so far as a pro, while he has the arm strength to profile in right field should he slow down as he matures. His power will have to show up for him to profile well there, but there's plenty of time for that, and all facets of his game, to develop.",-1

PERSON continued to impress during a pre-ORGANIZATION workout for the A's at the GPE, so much so that they gave him a franchise-record $5,303,000 bonus after selecting him sixth overall. Though the results were mixed during PERSON's pro debut in the Rookie-level PERSON, he did make strides during the second half, posting an .823 OPS with 10 extra-base hits over his final 22 games after producing a .468 OPS in the first half.PERSON is loaded with loud, promising tools. He generates well-above-average bat speed from the right side of the plate, albeit with a swing that currently has some holes and overall inconsistencies. That should improve as PERSON gains pro experience, however, and it could make him an average hitter in time. PERSON's plus raw power likely will be his calling card and could translate to 25-plus-homer seasons during his prime. Beyond his offensive tools, PERSON also possesses the plus speed and athleticism needed to play center field, where he spent his entire pro debut, though some evaluators peg him as a future right fielder on account of his remaining physical projection and plus arm strength. It may take PERSON some time to learn to harness his tools and refine his game, but the final product could be that of a run-producing, everyday outfielder who also adds value with his baserunning and defense.",-1
"PERSON missed the entire showcase circuit last summer and fall after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus in his left knee in May 2016. When he returned to the diamond this spring, he quickly displayed some of the best all-around tools available in the 2017 Draft while hitting .590 with 12 home runs in 28 games as a senior. He then blew away A's club officials during a pre-Draft workout at the GPE, so much so that they gave him a franchise-record $5,303,000 bonus after selecting him sixth overall. PERSON generates well-above-average bat speed from the right side of the plate. Some evaluators put similar grades on his speed and arm strength, though the consensus is that those tools are more plus than plus-plus. He should be a solid defender as well, though his instincts draw mixed reviews and he may wind up in right field rather than center.The one thing PERSON doesn't have is a history of solving quality pitching while swinging a wood bat. Some scouts worry that there's a lot going on with his swing and believe he'll have to streamline it. If he hits and taps into his power, he has 25-25 potential and should become a star.",-1

PERSON parlayed a very strong junior season at the GPE school into a fifth-round selection and above-slot bonus in the 2018 GPE, then went out and pitched extremely well during his pro debut in the Rookie-level Appalachian League.The Royals think they might have gotten a steal in the big left-hander, as his stuff during his debut all ticked up. He looked like a late-first-round type of college lefty, showing flashes of four above-average pitches across the board with plus command of it, albeit in a small sample size. His fastball touched 95 mph with good run and sink, and he used his slider very effectively, backdooring and backfooting it at will. He mixed in his power curve and changeup very effectively.PERSON got to spend some time with fellow lefty and 2018 draftee PERSON and should benefit from working with the other college arms from the GPE class.

"After a very strong Cape Cod League season last summer, scouts were excited to see what PERSON did for an encore in his junior year at ORGANIZATION. A transfer from ORGANIZATION College the year prior, PERSON really struggled out of the gate, at least in part under the weight of his mother undergoing cancer treatments across the country, but he started to swing the bat better as the spring wore on, showing enough to become the ORGANIZATION' fifth-round pick and reaching full-season ball in his debut.PERSON does have a really good left-handed swing when he's at his best, using the whole field well, giving some the belief he'll hit for average at the next level. After he started slowly, he might have tried too hard to catch up and was jumping at the ball and wasn't on time with his swing during games, though he did reel off a long hitting streak to bring his average up. There's some pull power to tap into, though he's definitely a hit over power type of offensive player. With a thicker build, PERSON's range is a little limited, and a hamstring injury this spring didn't help, but he has the chance to be adequate at third with a solid arm. If third doesn't work, he could be an offensive-minded second baseman or perhaps handle left field. PERSON played both corner outfield spots and some second while focusing mostly on third during his summer debut. But it's the bat the ORGANIZATION like the most, with the thought they might have found a Day 2 steal with this selection.",-1
"PERSON needed a shortstop to replace PERSON, now with the ORGANIZATION. So the ORGANIZATION went back to the ORGANIZATION, GPE, area, a region that had brought them standouts like PERSON and PERSON in the past, to find ORGANIZATION, a junior college transfer from GPE Joaquin Junior College. ORGANIZATION had a solid season as PERSON's leadoff hitter, though a hamstring injury kept him off the field for a stretch this spring. The ORGANIZATION saw enough of his tools to select him in the second round of the 2019 ORGANIZATION, inking him for a below pick value bonus of $697,500 and sending him to the rookie-level GPE League for his pro debut.With a strong and sturdy build, ORGANIZATION is an athletic shortstop who should be able to stay at the position. He has good hands and more than enough arm for the spot and his speed, which also gives him some basestealing ability and helps him in terms of range. At the plate, he's shown the ability to make hard contact with good bat speed. He has gap power to all fields and can drive the ball very well the opposite way. While his hamstring issue slowed him temporarily, he was back to full strength when the ORGANIZATION rolled around.Even though it was tough to get a lot of looks at ORGANIZATION because of the injury and there wasn't a ton of resume for the ORGANIZATION transfer, the ORGANIZATION loved his combination of tools at a premium position.

Three years of pitching at FACILITY later, topped off by an outstanding junior season as the ORGANIZATION' Friday night starter, PERSON became a fifth-round pick of the ORGANIZATION and signed for below his slot's recommend value. While PERSON still doesn't have wow stuff, he does throw harder than his high school days and has shown a very good feel for pitching. His fastball typically sits in the low-90s, but hitters don't see it because PERSON uses his 6-foot-7 frame well to create deception and gets excellent extension so his average heater gets on hitters in a hurry. With good movement up in the zone, he gets a lot of strikeouts with his fastball above the bat. His best secondary pitch is his changeup and he sells it well. His slider is fringy, but he mixes it in effectively.PERSON has done an outstanding job of throwing quality strikes as ORGANIZATION's ace and all of his stuff plays up because of his ability to command the ball, his size and the deception in his delivery. His ceiling is somewhat limited, but he has the chance to move quickly as a No. 4 or 5 type starter.",-1

He's strong enough to have some pop, with some in the organization thinking he'll reach at least 10 home runs annually down the road thanks to his strong hands and forearms. Defensively, it's likely going to take a while. His arm may be closer to average than the above-average some amateurs initially thought, and he'll grow into being an average receiver. PERSON has off-the-charts makeup and loves to catch, with the kind of presence teams covet behind the plate and the leadership to run a game well. Because he won't be outworked, there is a belief he will eventually reach his ceiling. With average grades across the board, he has the chance to be a solid every day catcher at the big league level.

"When PERSON was a Draft prospect at his ORGANIZATION high school in 2016, he was thought to be a potential all-around catcher in the future, one whose bat appeared ahead of his glove. After his first two summers of pro ball, he still has a ways to go, but it actually seems like his defense is more advanced than his offensive game.PERSON looks like could be a plus receiver down the road and does a lot of things well behind the plate. He's very mobile with soft hands, receiving and blocking well, showing an ability to get really low. He has very good framing skills and is arm is solid average and accurate, allowing him to throw out 36 percent of potential basestealers during his full-season debut in 2017. At the plate, the left-handed hitter does make consistent contact, but hasn't shown the ability to impact the baseball on a consistent basis. He does have strong hands and forearms, but hasn't been able to incorporate what overall strength he does have to drive the ball.Patience is always needed for catchers develop, especially ones from high school, as the added responsibilities can slow your progress. PERSON now looks like he at least has the tools to be a capable backup. If the bat can come around as some expected when he was an amateur, there's plenty of time for him to evolve into an everyday catcher.",-1
"The state of PERSON was teeming with scouts this past spring, as the high school ranks produced first-rounder PERSON who was taken 20th overall by the ORGANIZATION and GPE, taken in the second round by the ORGANIZATION and signed for $900,000, more than $200,000 below pick value.GPE was the best offensive catcher in the 2016 prep ranks and ended up the second high school backstop taken after GPE PERSON. He has a smooth left-handed swing with a ton of bat speed. Very strong, he barrels up a lot of balls, producing easy power. He has 20-homer potential and could hit for a decent average. He still has work to do behind the plate, though most feel he has the tools to stick behind the plate. He has a solid and accurate arm and moves well behind the plate, though he'll have to improve his receiving and blocking skills.It can take high school catchers a while to put it all together considering the rigors of the position. PERSON will be vital, but the end result could be an offensive minded everyday backstop in the big leagues.",-1
"Drafting high school catchers can be a risky business, and teams need to play the long game patience-wise in terms of development. That's even more true when that catcher hailed from a cold-weather state. The ORGANIZATION knew all of this when they took GPE in the second round of the 2016 Draft out of the ORGANIZATION prep ranks. His defensive work has been exemplary and he took a step forward with the bat in 2018, playing across two levels of ORGANIZATION A.There are few questions about GPE's ability to defend at this point. He's an outstanding blocker and receiver, with some thinking he'll be a plus defender overall. His above-average arm plays up because of its accuracy and his ability to transfer quickly as well as throwing from his feet or his knees, as he's thrown out 32.6 percent of potential basestealers heading into 2019. There could be more in GPE's left-handed bat as well. While he's big and strong, he employs a more conservative, contact-first swing. He did improve offensively in 2018, but the ORGANIZATION would like to see him let loose a little more to unlock more of his raw power.If that happens, then the ORGANIZATION could have a very intriguing every day catcher on their hands. But even if he stays the course, he has the tools necessary to have a successful backup backstop career.",-1

He served as designated hitter in the ORGANIZATION due to a shoulder injury. But he made the jump to short-season Class A in '18, where he caught more innings than anyone else in the LOCATION, while posting a .271 batting average with a .371 on-base percentage.A strong 6-foot-4, PERSON's arm strength is his defining trait as a catcher. He's well below two seconds with his pop time -- often below 1.9. Despite his size, the ORGANIZATION seem confident in his framing abilities, too. Offensively, PERSON's swing can get long, and it's got a few too many moving pieces. But he seems to understand the strike zone well enough, and he should develop a fair amount of power.PERSON has big strides to make on offense and some tweaks on defense.

He has advanced catch-and-throw skills, with pop times consistently in the mid-1.8-second range. His bat lags behind his defense and could slow him down some at the next level. He put up good numbers this spring, though scouts don't particularly love his swing. He is strong and physical, but his pop comes more from strength than from bat speed.GPE's name was moving up ORGANIZATION boards as PERSON approached with some late helium as teams looked for catchers who actually can stick behind the plate.

PERSON selected PERSON again, this time signing him for a well over-slot $800,000 in the fourth round.PERSON's curveball is a legitimate out pitch that climbs into the low 80s and has sharp break. He works at 90-93 mph with life on his fastball and usually touches 95-96 with less movement a couple of times each game. PERSON started using his changeup more often late this spring, and it shows the potential to become at least an average pitch.PERSON's delivery is smoother when he pitches in the low 90s but features effort and head movement when he dials up more velocity. Scouts who envision him as a starter like his three-pitch mix and believe he can improve his control and learn to pace himself better.

"ORGANIZATION began 2016 as the top-rated high school position player, then got surpassed by fellow GPE outfielder PERSON (who went ORGANIZATION. 1 overall) and fell to the ORGANIZATION at ORGANIZATION. 18 because of worries about his age (19 years, 1 month on GPE day) and signability. He tore up ORGANIZATION ball after signing for $3,282,000, a franchise record for a hitter, but batted just .260/.326/.348 with two homers in 101 Class A games in his first full season. GPE sent him to the FACILITY in July as part of a four-player package for PERSON, PERSON and PERSON Kahnle.Though ORGANIZATION failed to post big numbers in 2017, there were positives. He recognized pitches, made consistent contact and showed a willingness to use all fields, all of which bode well for him hitting for a high average. GPE believes his size, strength, bat speed and left-handed stroke will translate into at least average power once he learns which pitches he can drive.Sometimes compared to a more athletic version of PERSON, ORGANIZATION could have average or better tools across the board. He figures to slow down a bit as he matures physically, so he's unlikely to remain in center field despite spending most of his first two pro seasons there.

While he currently employs a line-drive approach, he has big raw power and will tap into it once he adds some loft to his swing.ORGANIZATION entered pro ball as a solid runner and a center fielder, but he should slow down as he starts to fill out and most scouts believe he'll wind up on an outfield corner. Evaluators grade his arm anywhere from fringy to above average. He has drawn comparisons to a more athletic version of PERSON.",-1
"ORGANIZATION entered 2016 as the top-rated high school position player for the GPE, then dropped to the ORGANIZATION at ORGANIZATION. 18 because of concerns about his signability and his age (at 19, he was old for a prepster). He slugged .570 in GPE ball after signing for $3,282,200, a franchise record for a hitter, but managed just a .395 mark at two Class A levels the next two seasons. The FACILITY acquired him in July 2017 as the headliner in a four-player package for PERSON, PERSON and PERSON Kahnle.ORGANIZATION still impresses scouts with his smooth left-handed swing, pitch-recognition skills and willingness to use the entire field. He makes repeated contact and club officials believed he could start to hit for more power in 2019 after adding strength in the offseason, though that hasn't happened. He has the size, strength and bat speed to produce 20 homers per season if he can stop hitting so many grounders and drive the ball more consistently.Compared to the likes of PERSON and PERSON, ORGANIZATION could have at least average tools across the board when he's fully developed. After playing primarily center field in his first two pro seasons, he spent the bulk of his time in right field last year. His average arm isn't a liability but ultimately could land him in left field.",-1
"The most productive hitter on the GPE national team that won a gold medal at the 18-and-under World Cup in GPE last September, ORGANIZATION began 2016 as the top-rated high school position player in the GPE. Eventually passed by fellow GPE outfielder PERSON, who became the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick of the ORGANIZATION, ORGANIZATION still was held in high regard. The ORGANIZATION took him with the 18th selection and paid him a well-over-slot bonus of $3,282,000, a club record for a position player.ORGANIZATION has everything he needs to hit for significant average and power. He has a smooth left-handed swing, bat speed and power, though he won't fully tap into his raw pop until he adds some more loft to his stroke. He recognizes pitches well, shows signs of promising plate discipline and generally uses the entire field.Presently a solid runner who broke into pro ball as a center fielder, ORGANIZATION could lose a step as he matures physically and wind up on an outfield corner. His arm draws average to solid grades from evaluators, so right field could be his ultimate destination. Some scouts liken him to a more athletic version of PERSON, who won a World Series ring with the 2000 ORGANIZATION.",-1
"PERSON wasn't a regular on the showcase circuit, in large part because he was a star quarterback at ORGANIZATION (PERSON, N.C.). He led the state with 4,340 passing yards and the ORGANIZATION to a 3-AA state title in 2017, then continued to shine in 2018. Despite his success on the gridiron, it was clear that PERSON, the best prospect from GPE Hanover since the ORGANIZATION made PERSON the seventh overall choice in the 1993 Draft, had a brighter future in baseball, and the D-backs were thrilled to find the high-ceiling lefty still on the board for their second pick in the first round. PERSON's 2019 GPE high school player of the year and a catalyst behind back-to-back state 3-A baseball championships, PERSON has shown glimpses of what he can become by working with a riding 90-93 mph fastball early in some games, but he'll also sit in the upper 80s at times and dip to 85 mph late in contests. He has natural feel for spinning the ball and has promising depth on his curveball, though it currently parks in the low 70s. He also can throw a lateral-breaking slider and flash an interesting changeup, though he doesn't use either offering much at this point.There isn't a lot of history with PERSON and his projectability is more attractive than his present stuff. But he's a quality athlete with a good arm action and delivery, fills the strike zone and still has the room to add 40-50 pounds to his lanky 6-foot-5 frame.",-1
"PERSON had built himself into a potential first-round pick coming out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks in 2017 thanks to his stuff, most notably his plus curve, and his projectability, landing at ORGANIZATION. 29 on ORGANIZATION's Top 200 Draft prospects list that spring. He ended up sliding a bit into the third round, where the ORGANIZATION took him and gave him a well-above-pick-value bonus of $2 million to sign him away from ORGANIZATION. While he did have two stints on the disabled list, with a back strain and ankle sprain, during his first full season, he did have a solid, albeit unspectacular performance in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON entered pro ball with a three-pitch mix that has now grown to four. His fastball will sit in the low 90s, often touching 95 mph, and there's still reason to believe there's more in the tank. While his curveball was his calling card as he entered pro ball, it wasn't as sharp in 2018, thrown in the 81-82 mph range. He added in a hard 86-87 mph slider that grades out as average and can mix in an average changeup as well. He needs to continue to get stronger and maintain his mechanics on his delivery in order to help him command the baseball more consistently, though there are no real red flags there.PERSON will focus on getting his curveball back to the plus offering it was in order to give him a true swing-and-miss out pitch. The ORGANIZATION love his competitiveness on the mound, thinking that mentality should help him take the next step forward towards being a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"A product of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks, PERSON's name was mentioned in many first round conversations as the 2017 PERSON approached. A bit of a velocity dip during the spring, to go along with a commitment to ORGANIZATION, allowed him to drop to the third round, where the ORGANIZATION gave him $2 million, more than $1 million above pick value, to sign.One of the best pitchers on the GPE national 18-and-under team last summer, PERSON has a very solid three-pitch mix, starting with perhaps the best breaking ball in the 2017 high school class. It's a true 12-to-6 curve thrown with low-80s power. His fastball was in the low 90s and hit 94 mph last summer, though he was more in the 88-92 mph range this past spring and needs to show he can maintain velocity deep into starts. That should come as he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame. PERSON has a loose, quick arm and repeats his delivery well, allowing him to already fill the strike zone. He mostly needs to add strength and develop his changeup to reach his upside as a frontline starter.",-1
"PERSON was one of many high school pitchers in the 2017 Draft class who were in many late first-round conversations. He ended up sliding a bit to the third round after a bit of a velocity dip during his senior season combined with his commitment to ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION used their bonus pool wisely and had $2 million, more than twice pick value, to sign him and he had a strong, albeit brief, debut in the ORGANIZATION League.Armed with a strong three-pitch mix and the ability to throw all of it for strikes, one of the biggest things PERSON needed to do was add strength to his 6-foot-3 frame and show he could maintain velocity throughout starts and through a season. Once listed at 170 pounds, PERSON was up over 190 thanks to strength and conditioning efforts during the offseason. That should help him keep his fastball at least in the low-90s consistently and make the times he touches 94-95 mph much more frequent. His curve ball is the pitch that separates him from other young arms, perhaps, a true 12-to-6 power breaking ball. He hasn't needed his changeup a ton in the past, but he has good feel for it.The ORGANIZATION are very excited to see what PERSON can do after his productive offseason. His stuff, projectability and feel for the strike zone all point to a young arm who could be a relatively fast mover.",-1
"PERSON's father, PERSON, pitched in the GPE system for parts of four seasons. PERSON has plenty of arm strength, but his future is as an infielder. A big summer on the showcase circuit put him high on follow lists, and while an uneven spring caused his stock to fall a little, the D-backs saw enough to take him in the 11th round and give him an above-pick-value bonus of $500,000 to sign him away from his GPE commitment.There are plenty of tools to be excited about with PERSON. It starts with his arm, which grades out as an 80 in terms of pure strength, though he'll need to work on accuracy with his throws across the diamond. He has good enough hands and range to stay at shortstop long-term. This spring, there were more questions about his bat. He has some raw power and bat speed, but there was enough swing-and-miss to worry some scouts about how his bat will translate at the next level, though he got off to a good start during his pro debut in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION League.Clearly the D-backs feel good about PERSON being able to continue to hit and become an all-around shortstop, even if it takes a while. If all else fails, he can always follow in his dad's footsteps to the mound, where he was 93-95 mph as a raw thrower in high school.",-1
"PERSON was a standout on the summer showcase circuit in 2017, but an uneven spring as a senior raised questions about his bat and caused his stock to fall a little. The D-backs saw enough to take him in the 11th round and give him an above-pick-value bonus of $500,000 to sign him away from his GPE commitment. The signing is already looking like a steal for ORGANIZATION after PERSON slashed .329/.417/.538 across two levels in his pro debut. There are plenty of tools to be excited about with PERSON. It starts with his near top-of-the-scale arm strength, though he'll need to work on accuracy with his throws across the diamond. He's an athletic shortstop with the hands and feel for the position, and there are mixed opinions as to whether he'll be able to remain there or have to move to second or third base. PERSON showed enough swing-and-miss as a senior that some scouts worried about how his bat would translate at the next level. He quickly addressed those concerns by hitting to all fields with a clean right-handed swing in his pro debut, and there's reason to believe he'll unlock some more power as he adds strength to his lean, athletic frame. The D-backs feel good about PERSON being able to continue to hit and become an all-around shortstop, even if it takes a while.",-1
"While PERSON (29th overall in 2018) didn't go as early in the first round of the Draft as his brother, GPE (12th overall to the ORGANIZATION in '15), he has a higher ceiling because he's a better pure hitter and much more athletic. He compiled an impressive amateur resume that includes ORGANIZATION with the GPE junior national team in 2017 and '18, and a trip to the ORGANIZATION finals in '17. After PERSON signed for an above-slot $2,578,138, he performed as advertised in his pro debut.One of the best pure hitters among high schoolers in the 2018 Draft, PERSON has a quick left-handed swing and advanced feel for the barrel. He controls the strike zone and uses the entire field, exhibiting no obvious shortcomings at the plate. While he focuses on making hard contact rather than worrying about home runs, his strength and hitting ability should translate into average or better power.PERSON's considerable offensive upside presents a bit of a dilemma, because GPE's current plan to keep him at catcher will take a toll on his bat and add to the development time he'll need in the ORGANIZATION. He's quicker than most backstops and has a solid arm, though he'll need to improve his throwing accuracy and bolster his receiving skills to stay behind the plate. He has enough arm and agility for third base, where he played for PERSON, and may be worth a try at second base.",-1
"PERSON PERSON went third overall in the 1985 Draft before winning 142 games during a 16-year big league career. His son, the consensus top prep prospect in the 2019 Draft class, beat him by one spot when the ORGANIZATION took him No. 2 overall after he performed well at several 2018 summer showcase events and he was named the ORGANIZATION national high school player of the year in 2019. PERSON signed for full pick value, $7,789,900, the third-highest Draft bonus in history.A rare potential five-tool shortstop, PERSON didn't always make consistent contact on the showcase circuit last summer, but scouts aren't worried about his bat, especially as he showed improvement on that front this past spring. The right-handed hitter shows good barrel control and some willingness to use the entire field, so he should hit for average as he modifies his aggressive approach. His raw power and speed are both plus tools, which, combined with his baserunning instincts, could make him a 20-20 player.PERSON covers plenty of ground at shortstop, has quick hands and possesses the arm strength to make all the necessary throws -- as well as pump mid-90s fastballs from the mound. His love for the game is evident, and scouts praise his makeup as much as his physical ability. That could allow him to move a bit more quickly than the typical high school draftee.",-1
" PERSON drew some mild scouting interest as a senior at GPE (PERSON) PERSON in 2016, but not enough to divert him from attending PERSON A&M. He won LOCATION Freshman of the Year honors and helped the Aggies reach the ORGANIZATION World Series in 2017, then shifted to shortstop as a sophomore. He may have been the best pure hitter among the half-dozen college shortstops who were first-round candidates in 2019 and the ORGANIZATION nabbed him with their second first-round pick, signing him for full pick value (just over $3.1 million) and sending him straight to full-season Rome for his pro debut.His outstanding hand-eye coordination allows PERSON to put the bat on the ball with ease. A left-handed hitter who's a bit unorthodox at the plate, he tends to get caught out on his front foot but still has the dexterity to slap singles to the opposite field. He also has the bat speed and leverage in his still-projectable 6-foot-4 frame to turn on balls, hinting at average power in his future.PERSON grew up around the game because his father PERSON is the head coach at PERSON-Dallas, and his instincts are apparent on the bases and in the field. He has a knack for stealing bases despite average speed and makes plays at shortstop. His arm is more accurate than strong, leading some scouts to project him as a second baseman, and he has the versatility and selflessness to fit anywhere in the infield.",-1
"An inconsistent summer showcase performance in 2016 carried over to an up-and-down senior year of high school in 2017, cementing ORGANIZATION's decision to head to the ORGANIZATION of GPE. He knew he'd be a Draft-eligible sophomore and two years later, he used a very strong season after missing most of his freshman year with injury to catapult himself into first-round conversations. He ended up landing in the second round, but the ORGANIZATION gave him late first-round money (just over $2.2 million) to sign and after a quick stop in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION, he headed to the ORGANIZATION in his first summer of pro ball.ORGANIZATION's offensive profile stands out the most. The 6-foot-3 infielder has the chance to hit at the next level with a knack for barreling up the baseball that was on display all spring. Added strength to his wiry frame translated into more ability to drive the ball, with the chance for future average power. He will have to refine his approach in terms of his swing and miss to reach his ceiling. A good athlete and plus runner, ORGANIZATION can steal a base as well.The jury is out whether he can stick at shortstop in the long-term. Some see a move to second base, but those who think his actions and hands are what's holding him back think he'd be best off in center field, where his athleticism would play well. The ORGANIZATION sent him out as a shortstop and will likely give him every opportunity to stick there.",-1
"Projectable and unpolished, PERSON majorly jumped on radars early in the spring with performances that had scouting directors running in to get a look. While he leveled off some as the spring progressed, his potential is exactly what the ORGANIZATION look for when they go after high school pitching, nabbing him in the fourth round and giving him an above-pick value $800,000 bonus to sign him away from his ORGANIZATION of GPE commitment.Out of the gate last spring, PERSON was up to 96 mph with his fastball, albeit with a lack of command, and he didn't back that up consistently. At times, he matched that velocity, while in other outings he was been more in the 91-93 mph range. He complements his fastball with a hard curve, showing an ability to spin the ball well, and some feel for a changeup. He rushes his delivery, and slowing his mechanics down will allow him to repeat it consistently and throw more strikes.His arm strength, size and upside all appealed to the ORGANIZATION, who have shown time and time again that they're not afraid of being patient in letting young pitching talent develop. That philosophy could help PERSON fulfill his potential as a big league starter.",-1
"PERSON is one of those prototypical high school pitchers who jump on the radar by showing a velocity spike in the spring before their Draft. The GPE prep standout did just that, and while his stuff backed up a little bit as PERSON approached, the ORGANIZATION saw enough they went above pick value to sign him in the fourth round of the 2016 Draft. In PERSON, the ORGANIZATION see a very good athlete on the mound, one with some current strength and certainly with the possibility of adding more as he matures. He showed a power arsenal and the ability to miss bats with all three of his pitches. He was consistently throwing 92-94 mph during instructs after a long year for the teenager. He has a hard curve that he can spin well and land for strikes when his mechanics are right, and he has feel for a changeup, with both secondary offerings having the potential to be at least average down the road. PERSON has already addressed some issues with his delivery, cleaning up a problem when his front side would get wide and open up too quickly, thus impacting his command. Now more direct to the plate, he could eventually have average control.There is still work to be done, and the ORGANIZATION have enough experience with high school pitching to know not to rush PERSON. With patience, he could develop into a strong left-handed rotation option.",-1
"PERSON's $600,000 bonus was the largest given to a left-hander on the international amateur market in 2015. The ORGANIZATION liked the GPE's projectable 6-foot-4 frame and his ability to reach the low 90s, and he has developed into one of the hardest-throwing young southpaws anywhere in the Minors. They've handled him carefully, limiting him to a total of 153 1/3 innings in his first three seasons, though he still advanced to Class A at age 19.PERSON's fastball topped out at 95 mph in 2017 and sat at 93-96 and peaked at 99 last season with typical four-seamer riding action. His secondary pitches can vary wildly in consistency, with his breaking ball showing flashes of becoming a plus power curve but also devolving into a slurve when he doesn't stay on top of it. His changeup is less reliable, showing some life but often arriving too firm in the low 90s.Since coming to the GPE in 2017, PERSON has had no problem throwing strikes. But his low-three-quarters arm slot and his mechanics lead some scouts to worry about his ability to master his secondary offerings and his command. He has the upside of a frontline starter and the fastball to serve as a high-leverage reliever if he can't stick in the rotation.",-1
"PERSON's $600,000 bonus was the largest given to any left-hander during the 2015-16 international amateur signing period. His projectable 6-foot-4 frame and a fastball that already crept into the low 90s at age 16 were his biggest selling points. He spent his first two pro seasons in GPE ball, posting a 3.28 ERA with 100 strikeouts in 98 2/3 innings.PERSON pitched with a 91-93 mph fastball and touched 95 last season as an 18-year-old, has topped out at 98 this year and should continue to add velocity as he gets stronger. He also has improved his curveball, which should become a solid pitch though it's still inconsistent. His changeup is in the rudimentary stages.Though he got roughed up during his 2017 GPE debut, PERSON continually challenged hitters. His command isn't as advanced as his control and he's still a teenager with a lot to learn. But as a lefty who could regularly work in the mid-90s, he has plenty of upside and will get plenty of time to develop.",-1
"PERSON's raw power and history on the high school showcase circuit put him in position to go in the early rounds of the 2018 Draft, but he didn't perform as well as a senior and scuffled in front of a large audience of scouts at the ORGANIZATION in March. Committed to PERSON and considered extremely difficult to sign, he lasted until GPE took him in the 21st round. After signing for $185,000, he had no problems adjusting to the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League.With his bat speed, strength and some loft in his right-handed stroke, PERSON offers impressive power potential. Some scouts questioned how well that pop would play in games because he didn't always make consistent contact as a prepster, but he has surprised the ORGANIZATION with a more advanced approach than they expected. In his debut, he has done a nice job of keeping his swing compact and balanced.Though PERSON lacks speed, he may be able to handle third base. He moves well at the hot corner, has reliable hands and earns average to solid grades for his arm strength. He'll have to work hard to maintain his conditioning because his only other option is first base.",-1
"Based on his power and track record of performing on the high school showcase circuit, PERSON entered 2018 as a consensus early-rounds prospect. But he didn't hit well last spring and particularly struggled in front of a large audience of scouts at the ORGANIZATION in GPE, in part because he was having vision issues. After signing him away from a ORGANIZATION State commitment for $185,000 in the 21st round, the ORGANIZATION helped him find contact lenses that worked and watched him hit like the old PERSON in his pro debut.Because he could see the ball better, PERSON made better contact as a pro than he did as a senior, and he also surprised GPE with a more advanced approach than expected. He does a nice job of keeping his right-handed swing compact and balanced rather than selling out for home runs. With his bat speed, and strength and loft in his stroke, his power comes naturally.Despite below-average speed, PERSON moves well at third base and may be able to remain there. He has reliable hands and average to solid arm strength. He'll have to maintain his conditioning because if he loses a half-step, his only other options are first base and ORGANIZATION.",-1
"When the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the second round of the 2016 Draft, they knew it might take a while for his raw tools and athleticsm to come into focus on the field, especially since his focus was split at his GPE high school as a standout wide receiver and outfielder. He wasn't even able to start his pro career in earnest until 2017 because of a back injury. The ORGANIZATION didn't want to get too excited about his debut in the ORGANIZATION that summer, but it was hard not to be encouraged by his 2018 that saw him play across both levels of A ball.While PERSON had a very productive first taste of full-season ball, what makes him an even more intriguing prospect is that he still has a lot to learn, especially at the plate. He does have a good feel to hit and showed he's more than willing to draw walks, but there is a lot of swing and miss there and he does need to work on the consistency of his swing. Once he does that, he should be able to hit for average and power. His speed works on both sides of the ball, and he showed the ability to steal a base and run down everything in center field. PERSON showed he can be a plus defender at all three outfield positions, and his plus arm certainly would play in right. He and top prospect Jo Adell form a super-athletic outfield prospect duo that could be ready to join PERSON in about a year.",-1
"A two-sport standout who started at ORGANIZATION in GPE as a wide receiver on a team that won state championships in 2013 and 2014, the ORGANIZATION were keen on adding his tools to their system when they took him in the second round of the 2016 Draft. It took longer than anticipated, with a back issue tangling negotiations, but he eventually signed for a bonus equaling the pick value for ORGANIZATION. 60 overall.A quality athlete, PERSON should improve on the diamond now that he'll be focused on one sport. He has both bat speed and strength, though there is some work to be done on his left-handed swing so he can develop a consistent approach and realize his offensive potential. PERSON's plus speed should allow him to play center field, though he played right in high school. He has more than enough arm for the corner spot, firing low-90s fastballs off the mound in the past. PERSON was working throughh is back issue after signing, but once he gets going he has the chance to profile as an ultra-toolsy up-the-middle player, something the ORGANIZATION system sorely needs.",-1
"PERSON is a product of a strong high school program at ORGANIZATION in GPE, one who excelled both on the diamond and on the gridiron as a wide receiver. The ORGANIZATION loved his upside and athleticism enough to take him in the second round of the 2016 Draft, but they had to wait to see him play until 2017 as a back issue was found in his post-Draft physical. The wait was worth it, as he was one of the more exciting players in the Rookie-level Appalachian League.Despite having split his focus among two sports in high school, missing his summer debut and then being out for a short spell with a thumb injury in 2017, PERSON has a very good feel to hit and the ORGANIZATION feel he could be at least an above-average hitter in time. He makes consistent hard contact, recognizes pitches well and should grow into at least average power. A plus runner who can steal a base, PERSON has more than enough speed to play center field and a plus arm that would fit perfectly well in right.The ORGANIZATION were excited to see what PERSON could do over the course of a full, healthy season as he continues to grow into his athletic frame, and he hasn't disappointed, playing across two levels of A ball and forming an exciting 1-2 outfield punch with 2017 first-rounder Jo Adell.",-1
"It's never a bad thing to try and target up-the-middle athletes in the GPE. For the past two years, the ORGANIZATION have gone that route early, taking PERSON in 2015 then taking PERSON a year later, also in the second round. A back issue found in his physical delayed his signing and the ORGANIZATION erred on the side of caution and held him out of play last summer.PERSON didn't play in games during instructional league games in GPE last fall, but he did finally see some action in their GPE instructs program after that and he is ready to hit the ground running in 2017. PERSON has bat speed and strength, with the chance to eventually be an above-average hitter with solid average power from the left side of the plate. PERSON runs well and has a strong arm that would work well in right field, though the ORGANIZATION believe he could stay in center long term because of his athleticism. He has the kind of build and athleticism that reminds some of a ORGANIZATION type player.PERSON needs reps and to get on the field so he can start sharpening his raw tools and reach his considerable ceiling. If it all clicks, he has a chance to be a five-tool player manning an outfield spot in the big leagues on a daily basis.",-1
"PERSON burst onto the prospect scene last spring at FACILITY CC, and he might have gone in the first three rounds of the 2018 Draft if his asking price hadn't pushed him to PERSON. A 36th-round choice by the ORGANIZATION last June, he didn't pitch in the fall while recovering from surgery to repair the labrum in both of his hips, then performed well at two heavily scouted tournaments at the beginning of the 2019 season. There was a lack of consistency, but his upside potential landed him in the second round, where he signed for a below-slot bonus of $925,000.When he's at his best, PERSON can operate at 91-94 mph and reach 96 with his fastball, which plays up with late life and downhill plane, and backs it up with a mid-80s slider. At other times, he'll work around 90 mph with his heater and lose velocity and sharpness on his slider. He can achieve good depth on his curveball and some tumble on his changeup, though the latter offering can get too firm.PERSON has the athleticism and easy arm action to throw strikes but struggles with control and command. His 6-foot-6 frame not only creates difficult angle but also has projection remaining. He has considerable untapped potential and could become a mid-rotation starter if he figures everything out.",-1
"The Pirates have long coveted big, projectable and athletic high school arms in the GPE, so it should come as no surprise they liked PERSON, who set what is believed to be a national high school record with 37 touchdown receptions as a junior wide receiver in 2016. The GPE prepster gave up football to focus on baseball as a senior, and his stock went up as a result, landing in the second round, where PERSON gave him an above-pick-value bonus of $1.825 million to sign him away from his GPE commitment.PERSON is more about future projection than now stuff, though he showed flashes, especially late in the state playoffs. He has a loose, quick arm, but was pitching at 85-88 mph in the late innings for much of the spring. PERSON sat at 92 mph and touched 94 during the postseason. He throws his heater with sink, something the ORGANIZATION love, and he uses his 6-foot-5 frame well to create extension and angle. PERSON's slider has promise -- an upper-70s breaking ball currently with good tilt that will improve as he adds power. He has feel for a changeup, though it's a work in progress, and his athleticism helps him repeat his delivery and throw strikes.There is a lot more in the tank for PERSON, with the potential to eventually have two plus pitches and the ability to command them once he adds strength. It will take some time, but he has the chance to be at least a mid-rotation starter when all is said and done.",-1
"A two-sport high school standout who starred as a wide receiver as well as a pitcher, PERSON left the gridiron for good to focus on baseball as a senior. He started rising up ORGANIZATION boards among prep pitchers and landed in the second round, where the ORGANIZATION went above slot ($1.825 million) to keep him from attending PERSON, then sent him to make his brief professional debut in the ORGANIZATION League.At 6-foot-5 and closing in on 200 pounds, PERSON is the prototypical athletic and projectable high school right-hander. He's been up to 94 mph consistently already, and with his frame, he's likely to add strength and velocity as he matures and he throws his fastball with excellent extension, angle and sink. His slider was up to 82-85 mph in the ORGANIZATION and could give him a second plus pitch in time. The changeup is behind the other two pitches, but he has a feel for it and there's confidence it will catch up and be at least an average offering. PERSON has a clean delivery and that plus athleticism helps him repeat it, which points to an ability to throw strikes consistently. The ORGANIZATION are no strangers to being patient with projectable prep pitchers, which will come in handy as they help PERSON hopefully reach his ceiling as a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"A star for PERSON during the 2015 18U World Cup in GPE, PERSON continued to boost his GPE stock the following spring with a dominant senior year. It all led to PERSON becoming the highest-drafted Alabama prep since 1971 (ORGANIZATION, fourth overall) as PERSON selected him with the seventh-overall pick in June and signed him away from a ORGANIZATION commitment with an above-slot bonus.

"The highest-drafted Alabama prepster since ORGANIZATION went fourth overall in 1971, PERSON gave up a ORGANIZATION scholarship to sign for $4,145,900 as the ORGANIZATION. 7 choice in 2016.

But he made just four starts in his 2017 pro debut before undergoing PERSON surgery and missing all of last season.If he can regain his health and previous stuff, PERSON could be the best pitcher in the ORGANIZATION system. Before he got hurt, he not only had an upper-70s curveball with tight spin and impressive depth, but also showed the aptitude to land it for strikes or use it as a chase pitch. He also had a 90-94 mph fastball and showed similar velocity when he logged a few innings in GPE's instructional league program last fall, and he could add more power to his heater as he gets stronger.PERSON's changeup gives him a solid third offering with which to attack hitters. All of his pitches play up because he commands and mixes them well. The ORGANIZATION expect to turn him loose in 2019 and hope he can reach his ceiling as a ORGANIZATION. 2 starter.",-1
"GPE's best prep pitching prospect since PERSON went 12th overall to the ORGANIZATION in 2006, PERSON helped PERSON win the 18U World Cup in GPE in September.

Despite some signability concerns, the PERSON selected PERSON with the seventh overall pick and then lured him away from a ORGANIZATION commitment with an above-slot, $4,145,900 bonus. PERSON featured one of the better curveballs among high schoolers in the 2016 Draft class, a 76-80 mph bender with good depth, though he can fall in love with his breaking ball at times. He also throws an 88-94 mph fastball with deceptive angle and some late life. Both pitches figure to add more velocity once PERSON strengthens his athletic frame.PERSON has feel for a changeup that has shown signs of developing into a plus pitch as he has used it more as a senior. With his loose, whippy arm and clean delivery, he shouldn't have trouble remaining a starter in pro ball. PERSON has a ceiling of a No. 2 starter and a relatively high floor for a high school pitcher.",-1
"GPE looks like one of the better investments in the ORGANIZATION's deep 2017 international class, signing for $28,000 out of the ORGANIZATION at the relatively advanced age of 18. In his 2018 pro debut, he finished among the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION leaders in GPE (0.73, second), opponent average (.162, third) and K/BB ratio (6.8, sixth). PERSON deemed him suitably advanced to bring him to the GPE for the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League playoffs.Though GPE is very much a work in progress and has been knocked around in Class A this year, he displays the potential for three solid or better pitches. His fastball presently sits at 91-93 mph and touches 96 with some sink, and he could add more velocity as he gets stronger. His low-80s slider stands out more for its velocity than its bite but he will flash some sharp ones.GPE also shows some feel for a changeup with some fade, though it's not as consistent as his other offerings. While he was a bit old for the ORGANIZATION, his ability to throw strikes and keep the ball down in the zone was apparent. He has a ceiling of a mid-rotation starter but will need plenty of development time to get there.",-1

PERSON strong right now, he has room to add strength as he physically matures. There's more pop in the bat than you might think now, with more to come in the future. Right now, he's more of a line-drive hitter to all fields. He has good instincts for his age and has a decent approach from both sides of the plate. An above-average runner, he plays a very solid center field, covering a good amount of ground with a solid average arm. It will take some time to discover exactly what PERSON can become, but he has the chance to be a very good all-around center fielder down the road, with a move to right field -- depending on how he matures -- not out of the question.",-1

A line-drive hitter who uses the whole field, he has good instincts for his age as well as a decent approach from both sides of the plate. He's an above-average runner who plays a solid center field, where he covers a good amount of ground and shows a slightly above-average arm.Just 18 years old, PERSON will need time to come into his own as a player.

PERSON's development at the plate in the coming years will help to bring his ultimate ceiling into focus, but it goes without saying that the ORGANIZATION, much like GPE, believe it could be considerable.",-1
"While many international amateur free agent pitchers are signed because of big arms and the hope of premium velocity, PERSON stood out for his advanced feel for pitching at his age, not to mention his left-handedness, and the ORGANIZATION gave him $300,000 to sign at the start of the 2017-18 signing period. He was as advertised during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2018.Just 18 for the 2019 season, PERSON had a really good delivery and pitchability as he entered pro ball, but he lacked physicality. He's started to add strength, and his stuff is starting to tick upwards. His fastball usually sits in the 88-91 mph range, but he reaches back for 92-93 mph with ease. He throws a little across his body and the ball jumps out of his hand, with the ride on his fastball, thanks to high spin rates up in the zone, allowing the pitch to play above-average. He throws two distinct breaking balls, both are legitimate weapons, and he has some feel for his changeup as well.It's a small sample size, but PERSON did fill up the strike zone during his debut in the ORGANIZATION. Now he's coming to the GPE to see how his feel for pitching will allow him to climb the ORGANIZATION' ladder.",-1
"The GPE landed PERSON during the same 2017-18 international signing period that also netted the organization rising prospects PERSON and PERSON. While those two players were both plagued by injuries in '18, PERSON excelled in his first taste of pro ball at age 17, beginning in the ORGANIZATION and then moving stateside to the Rookie-level PERSON, where he was named a postseason All-Star after producing a .343 average, the circuit's third-best mark.The switch-hitting PERSON possesses one of the more advanced bats in GPE's system, as some evaluators have pegged him as a plus hitter. He has preternatural feel for finding the barrel from both sides of the plate to go along with an advanced approach and present pitch recognition. And while he's currently lean and somewhat undersized, PERSON does have a projectable frame that portends modest game power in future years.PERSON's speed is another plus tool, one that gives him impact potential on the basepaths and translates to above-average range at shortstop, where he's an above-average defender with average arm strength. What's more, club officials are quick to praise the teenager's maturity, makeup and intelligence, qualities that they believe help make him a special player.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION' 2017 international class has a chance to be special, highlighted by three potential impact hitters in PERSON, fellow ORGANIZATION switch-hitting shortstop PERSON and GPE outfielder PERSON. His $125,000 bonus was a fraction of what PERSON paid GPE ($1.5 million) and GPE ($1.3 million), and he already looks like a bargain. PERSON hit his way to the GPE as a 17-year-old last summer, finishing third in the ORGANIZATION batting race (.343) as the rookie circuit's third-youngest qualifier.PERSON has advanced feel for hitting and pitch recognition, along with a sweet swing from both sides of the plate. He commands the strike zone but makes contact so easily that he doesn't draw many walks. While he's small and not physically mature, he has quick hands and snap in his wrists that should produce at least gap power.PERSON has plus speed and is very aggressive on the bases, so he could be a prolific basestealer once he improves his reads and jumps.

He has a quick, clean arm action and plenty of room to add muscle on his 6-foot-4 frame, so he has the potential for consistent mid-90s heat once he's fully developed. His size and high three-quarters arm slot create steep downhill plane that add to the difficulty of barreling his fastball.PERSON's slider also is trending up, showing the potential to become a solid pitch in the low 80s with some depth. He didn't use his changeup much as an amateur and will need it to keep left-handers in check. While he'll require time to develop, he's so young and projectable that the payoff could be worth the wait.",-1

He deals at 91-95 mph with ground-ball-inducing sink on his heater and pairs it with a hard curveball. He also shows promising feel for his changeup.PERSON has a compact delivery and repeats it easily.

He made just three starts in 2018 before going down with an elbow injury that required PERSON surgery.Prior to getting hurt, PERSON showed signs of developing a plus fastball and curveball, though both offerings need more consistency. He worked at 92-94 mph and tops out at 96 mph with good sink on his heater and his curveball featured power and depth. His changeup had its moments too, though it wasn't as effective as his top two pitches.PERSON has a very compact delivery and is learning to repeat it efficiently. He should have at least average control but his command isn't yet as advanced, so he's more hittable than a lefty who can provide three solid pitches should be. If he can return to health and make the necessary refinements, he could be a No. 3 starter.",-1

He built upon that progress at ORGANIZATION A Delmarva in his first full season, finishing among the top five in the circuit in both ERA (2.86) and innings pitched (132). PERSON compensates for his lack of a true plus offering by demonstrating advanced feel for his craft. His arsenal is centered on a bowling-ball fastball that registers at 91-94 mph with exceptional late sinking action that has helped him to record ground-ball rates of 58 and 55 percent in his first two seasons, respectively. PERSON's low-80s slider flashes above average, and he has good feel for locating, and he rounds out his arsenal with a changeup that plays nicely off his fastball and has average potential.

He has the upside of an everyday shortstop who hits for average, swipes some bags and plays solid if unspectacular defense at a premium position.",-1
"PERSON was an under-the-radar international signing in the summer of 2014, one who pitched sparingly in the ORGANIZATION in 2015. He was set to make his GPE debut in 2016, but an elbow injury that required PERSON surgery put that off until 2017, but he was back impressing in the ORGANIZATION this summer.The Twins think the teenager has the chance to be a starter long-term. He has a premium fastball, one that has improved considerably since he's signed. He'll sit in the 95-98 mph range and can occasionally touch triple digits. He features two breaking balls that both have the chance to be better than average, an 86-87 mph slider and a curve he throws in the 80-82 mph range. He has a changeup, but it's not a real weapon at this point.PERSON's command and control are a work in progress, unsurprising given his age and his proximity to elbow surgery. As he puts that further in his rearview mirror, he might have the highest ceiling of any arm in the system.",-1
"The Twins have had their fair share of large international expenditures, like PERSON and current shortstop prospect PERSON. Then there have been smaller signings, like PERSON, who got just $150,000. After missing the 2016 season due to PERSON surgery, PERSON had a breakout GPE debut in 2017, finishing with a strong outing in the GPE League playoffs and putting him firmly on the prospect map.PERSON has exciting raw stuff that was clearly too much for Rookie-level hitters. His fastball now sits at 95-98 mph and he can touch triple digits. He throws two distinct breaking balls and both are viable weapons, with his slider having the chance to be a wipe out plus pitch down the road. His changeup is behind those two secondary offerings, but he has a feel for it and it could be PERSON average in time.PERSON has definitely been control over command, with his pure stuff helping mask any issues in that regard at the lower levels. But the Twins are very encouraged with the strike-throwing strides he made in 2017 and feel he could climb the ranks as one of the better pitching prospects in baseball as he ascends through the organization.",-1
"After signing in the summer of 2014 for just $150,000, PERSON pitched sparingly in the ORGANIZATION League the following year, then missed all of 2016 because of PERSON surgery. He eased his way back with a solid performance across two rookie levels in 2017, then really jumped on the prospect radar by excelling at two levels of full-season ball, topping 100 innings for the first time and helping ORGANIZATION Myers win the ORGANIZATION State League title in 2018.PERSON's stuff continues to get better the more he matures and the further removed from surgery he gets. His fastball touches triple digits and will often sit in the 96-98 mph range, with an ability to maintain velocity deep into starts. Throwing with plenty of sink, PERSON misses bats and gets a ton of ground-ball outs off of his fastball. When he committed to throw the harder version of his slider, in the 87-89 mph range, it trended toward plus, but he would back off of it at times. Continued separation between that and his slower curve will help, as will further refinement of his changeup.The right-hander filled up the strike zone in the ORGANIZATION and was still pretty consistent up a level as a teenager, pointing to perhaps better-than-average control in the future. His stuff, command and strength all add to a big up arrow next to his name, with a future as a frontline starter a distinct possibility.",-1
"GPE (Ill.) PERSON graduated the tallest man in recorded history (PERSON, who grew to 8-foot-11) in 1936, and 79 years later it produced a towering pitcher. PERSON' best prep pitching prospect since the ORGANIZATION made PERSON a first-rounder in 2010, the 6-foot-8 PERSON went in the third round and signed for $1.1 million. He has the highest ceiling of the three high school lefties the ORGANIZATION gave seven-figure bonuses to in 2014-15, eclipsing PERSON and PERSON's a lot of room on his skinny frame to add strength, and it's easy to envision PERSON becoming a true power pitcher once he fills out. His 88-94 mph fastball could sit in the mid-90s, and his already-formidable upper-70s curveball with depth could become an absolute hammer. He commands his bender extremely well, showing the ability to throw it for strikes or to get hitters to chase it out of the strike zone.PERSON tends to fall in love with his curve, one of the best in the 2015 high school ranks, and needs to work more on his changeup, which lags behind his main two pitches. He has tremendous athleticism and coordination for a still-growing pitcher his size, so his control and command should be fine despite some struggles in those areas this summer.",-1
"The best Illinois high school pitching prospect since the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the first round in 2010, PERSON went in the third round in June and signed for $1.1 million. He adds to the stable of talented prep southpaws grabbed in the last two PERSONs by the GPE, joining PERSON and PERSON had one of the best curveballs in the 2015 high school PERSON class, a 75-78 mph bender with depth that should add more power as he fills out his skinny 6-foot-8 frame. He commands his curve well though he tended to rely on it too often as an amateur.For now, PERSON pitches with an 86-90 mph fastball that tops out at 92. With his arm action, athleticism and projection, he could regularly work in the mid-90s in the future. He has the beginnings of a changeup but didn't need it much in high school and doesn't trust the pitch.",-1
"GPE' best high school pitching prospect since the ORGANIZATION made PERSON a first-round pick in 2010, GPE signed for $1.1 million as a third-rounder in 2015. He's a product of GPE (Ill.) High, which graduated the tallest man in recorded history (8-foot-11 PERSON) in 1936, and GPE towers over most players at 6-foot-8. He had a rough first full season as a pro, recording a 5.06 ERA in the short-season LOCATION as his mechanics and control got out of whack.GPE has the potential for a well-above-average fastball and curveball. He has a ton of projection remaining in his skinny frame, which should mean more power for a heater that already can reach 94 mph with sink and a curve that can be a hammer in the upper 70s. Neither pitch was at its best when he had trouble maintaining his normal three-quarters arm slot last summer, when he often pitched with an 86-88 mph fastball and lost some faith in a diminished curveball.GPE knows he needs to work on his changeup and overemphasized it at times last year. He has good athleticism and body control for his size, so he's equipped to figure out his delivery and improve his control and command. His ceiling remains sky-high, though it may take him longer to develop than initially expected.",-1
"PERSON expected to sign with the Brewers at the start of the 2015 international signing period that July, but a groin injury squashed that deal and he wound up joining the ORGANIZATION for $25,000 six months later. He was the youngest pitcher (age 18) in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON in 2018, though his rocky season ended shortly afterward because of a sore back. He has come back better than ever this year, adding a slider and improving his velocity and control.PERSON has the potential for three solid or better offerings, starting with a fastball that ranges from 93-98 mph with late sink that induces a lot of swings and misses as well as weak grounders. He didn't have much success with his curveball in 2018 and now relies more on a power slider in the mid-80s. He also sells a fading changeup with deceptive arm speed.At least 50 pounds heavier than his listed weight of 160, PERSON has learned how to adapt to his bigger body. After displaying advanced pitchability in the past, he saw his walk rate jump from 3.0 per nine innings in 2017 to 7.3 last year, but he's back to throwing strikes. He has the upside of a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"Though he was eligible to sign out of GPE in July 2015, PERSON had to wait six months before the ORGANIZATION offered him a $25,000 bonus. His success during his 2016 pro debut in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION prompted GPE to jump him to low Class A last season, when he was the youngest player in the LOCATION League at age 18. He handled the challenge with aplomb and helped GPE win the ORGANIZATION championship, then encored by pitching in the ORGANIZATION All-Star Future Game in 2018.PERSON combines promising present stuff with projectability and pitchability. He already has a 90-94 mph fastball that reaches 97 mph with late life, and his quick arm and room to add strength to his 6-foot-3 frame bode well for developing a consistent plus heater. His changeup is his best secondary offering, as he throws it with deceptive arm speed and fade, and has similar upside.PERSON has good shape to his curveball and can throw it for strikes, and it shows flashes of becoming a solid pitch now that he has added power to it in 2018. He misses bats, generates a lot of ground balls and has the upside of a No. 3 starter. After showing advanced pitchability for a teenager in the past, his control has regressed this season, which could slow down his timetable for arriving in the big leagues.",-1
"PERSON was eligible to sign out of GPE in July 2015 but didn't find any takers until the ORGANIZATION offered him a $25,000 bonus six months later. He fared well in his pro debut in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION, striking out 61 in as many regular-season innings and spinning six shutout frames in the playoffs.PERSON already works in the low 90s and hits 94 mph with late life on his fastball. Given his arm speed and projectable frame, he projects to develop a plus heater. He presently shows more feel for his changeup than his curveball, and both could develop into solid secondary offerings if they become more consistent and he adds some power to his breaking ball.Making his GPE debut ahead of schedule and at a higher level than expected when he reported to low Class A in May, PERSON is already generating some momentum. He also impressed during instructional league and is one of the more intriguing starting pitching prospects in GPE's system. With his stuff, pitchability and physique, he easily profiles as a No. 4 starter and could grow into more than that.",-1
"A part-time starter as an GPE freshman in 2017, PERSON exploded as a sophomore. He batted .406/.462/.671 to win ORGANIZATION player of the year honors, set school and league records with a 32-game hitting streak and continued to rake in the ORGANIZATION. He missed some time with back issues as a junior but still posted strong numbers en route to a fifth-round selection by the ORGANIZATION in the 2019 Draft. PERSON viewed PERSON as one of the more polished hitters in the college ranks. He has fine hand-eye coordination and a disciplined, balanced approach that allows him to make repeated contact to all fields. He has quickness in his left-handed stroke and strength and leverage in his 6-foot-3 frame, giving him solid raw power that he taps into without selling out for home runs.Most of PERSON's value will come from his bat, but that could be considerable value as he has the upside of a .280 hitter with 20 homers on an annual basis. Though he's a below-average athlete with speed and arm strength to match, he can play an adequate left field when he's fully healthy.",-1
"PERSON, a ORGANIZATION high school product signed away from going to Vanderbilt by the Cardinals in the second round of the 2015 Draft, really struggled during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION. He learned from adversity, and he had a strong second summer in the GPE. A jump up to full-season ball in 2017 didn't go well, but PERSON righted the ship a bit when he went down to the Class A Short-Season New York-Penn League.PERSON was drafted largely because of his potential with the bat. He can drive the ball to all fields when he stays up the middle with his approach and there is raw power, though he has yet to tap into it. PERSON broke into pro ball as a third baseman, but he has made the move to the outfield. He's played both corners, with a strong enough arm to profile in right if needed.Perhaps pushed too aggressively to start the year, PERSON might be a one-level-per-year player, but his work ethic and makeup should allow him to see it through.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION went high school heavy at the start of the 2015 Draft, using their first three selections for three from the prep ranks. Two were hitters, with PERSON going in the first round and PERSON, the native of GPE, being signed away from his ORGANIZATION commitment in the second.Though he struggled during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON has all the makings of a solid hitter. He has a solid setup at the plate and excellent bat speed. There's definitely power there, though he gets into trouble when he tries to pull too much. He has more than enough strength to drive the ball the other way and when he stays up the middle, he makes hard contact. PERSON pitch selection and strike zone knowledge will help as well. Defensively, PERSON has the arm for third base, but the rest of his defensive game at the hot corner is a work in progress, particularly his footwork. He would profile well from an outfield corner should a move be necessary.For now, the ORGANIZATION will let PERSON stay at third and see if he can make progress. Either way, it's his bat that will eventually push him up the organizational ladder.",-1
"The second of four accomplished hitters the ORGANIZATION selected in the first four rounds of the 2015 Draft, PERSON went 66th overall and signed for $1.2 million. He'll need to find a defensive home but there are few concerns about his bat.PERSON has enough power potential to profile just about anywhere on the diamond. He combines bat speed and strength and can really do some damage when he turns on a pitch. Though his right-handed swing can get a bit long at times, he has a good approach and makes consistent hard contact.PERSON played third base in high school and broke into pro ball there, but the consensus among scouts is that he'll need to move to left field. He doesn't have the quickness for the hot corner, and his footwork and throwing accuracy need a lot of work.",-1
"GPE shortstops with solid all-around tools aren't always easy to find in any Draft class. That's why PERSON, who looks and plays a lot like ORGANIZATION shortstop PERSON, was high on lists entering this spring. The ORGANIZATION product continued to perform as a junior and was the first of five college shortstops taken in the first round as a result, getting $3.9 million as the ORGANIZATION. 14 overall pick.Nearly all of PERSON's tools grade out as at least above-average. He has the chance to be a plus hitter, with very advanced bat-to-ball skills. He's never overmatched and always seems comfortable in the box, handling good velocity and offspeed stuff equally well, while walking more than he's struck out in his college career. Even when he's off-balance, he keeps his hands back and shoots the ball the other way to left field. And while he'll never sell out his hit tool for power, he'll show pop in batting practice and it's easy to dream on 15-18 homers annually at the next level.While PERSON does show off a plus arm at times, the one area there's a split camp might be his ability to play shortstop in the big leagues. Most give him a chance to stick there, given his makeup and instincts, unless the team he's on has a better defender on the roster.",-1

Signed for $2.1 million as the 26th overall pick, he was slowed by tendinitis in his knees during his pro debut, but his five-tool potential was evident in his first full season.While PERSON isn't as raw on the diamond as a lot of two-sport stars, he will also need time to refine his tools into skills. He has impressive hand-eye coordination and bat speed from the right side of the plate, though he's still working on pitch recognition and plate discipline and lost some needed development time in 2019 to a broken hamate and an ankle injury. He's starting to drive the ball more consistently and could produce 25 or more homers annually as he gets stronger.PERSON's most obvious tool is his well-above-average speed and he shows the aptitude to become a premium basestealer. His reads and jumps are less polished in center field, though he has the quickness to outrun a lot of his mistakes and should get better with more experience.

Though he was bothered by tendinitis in his knees during his pro debut, his upside was apparent.For an athlete who divided his attention between multiple sports, PERSON isn't nearly as raw as might be expected. His impressive hand-eye coordination should allow him to make consistent contact from the right side of the plate, and his pitch recognition and selectivity are surprising considering his inexperience. PERSON entered his senior season unsure about his power potential, but he began to drive the ball more consistently and has the bat speed and strength for average pop. PERSON's well above-average speed and his strong arm can make him a quality defender anywhere in the outfield. He's still learning as a basestealer and needs to upgrade his reads and routes in center field.

The ORGANIZATION do a nice job of finding and developing high-ceiling athletes, and he definitely fits that mold.",-1
"When the D-backs took ORGANIZATION in the fifth round in 2017, they made him the first player to be drafted out of GPE (N.J.) High since PERSON in 2009. PERSON signed for $500,000, forgoing his commitment to GPE, then showcased innate feel for squaring up the baseball during his pro debut. That continued for him in 2018 with a move up to the ORGANIZATION, where PERSON produced a .327/.396/.465 line and garnered honors as a mid-season All-Star. PERSON may be stocky and lacking in physical projection, but there is plenty to like about his offensive profile. His quick bat and excellent control of the barrel enable him to make consistent line-drive contact from the right side, where he covers the plate well and shows a discerning eye. Those qualities should help him succeed at higher levels and, in general, give him the upside of an above-average hitter who's capable of hitting 15-plus homers and reaching base at a high clip. A better athlete than his stout frame suggests, PERSON is an average runner with good instincts on both sides of the ball. He impressed club officials last year with his improvements at third base, and he'll likely add more positions to his resume going forward as the D-backs look to increase his versatility.",-1
"PERSON was well known within scouting circles entering his senior season at ORGANIZATION (Ala.) High, but the difference between his present stuff and his projection was wide enough that he was expected to continue his career at ORGANIZATION rather than turn pro. The industry's perception of PERSON changed quickly when he showed better velocity in the spring, and he vaulted up teams' Draft boards as a result. In the end, it was the Brewers who secured the rights to the young right-hander's promising future, signing him for $1.45 million after selecting him in the second round. After topping out at 91 mph with his fastball on the summer showcase circuit, PERSON operated at 90-93 mph as a senior and touched 97, while also impressing scouts with his ability to create leverage to the plate using his 6-foot-6 frame. In terms of secondaries, PERSON' slider shows more potential than his curveball, and he'll flash a changeup as well. PERSON, like so many young pitchers, struggles to repeat his arm slot, making it difficult for him to stay on top of his breaking pitches and control his entire arsenal.

GPE put up better numbers as a junior, albeit without much hard contact. He does have bat speed and a little pop to his pull side, but he tends to be off-balance often when he swings.At worst, GPE has a career as a defensive-minded utilityman ahead of him, with the upside of being a glove-first regular at shortstop.

The ORGANIZATION made GPE the ORGANIZATION. 37 overall pick that June, signed him for $1.8 million and then sent him straight to Class A Delmarva for his professional debut. GPE is a gifted defender at shortstop, with the range, actions and arm strength, as well as the soft hands and outstanding internal clock, needed to stay at the position long-term. There are questions about GPE's bat, though, and he didn't assuage any concerns by hitting .216 with an elevated strikeout rate in his pro debut. That said, he does have bat speed and a little pop to his pull side, with solid understanding of the strike zone. The ORGANIZATION believe GPE's emphasis on making contact early in the count instilled an element of panic in his swing, and they worked with him in during hitter mini camps in the fall on developing a better foundation to hit.

"Hailing from the baseball powerhouse PERSON in the ORGANIZATION area, ORGANIZATION entered his senior season as one of the better pure bats in the prep class. He struggled that spring and slid to the second round of the 2017 Draft. While he definitely hit the proverbial wall during his first full season of pro ball, overall he's looked very much like the advanced bat the ORGANIZATION hoped was still in there when they selected him.A LOCATION League All-Star in 2018, ORGANIZATION has an innate ability to barrel the ball in the strike zone, with an approach that gives him the chance to be a plus hitter in the future. The ORGANIZATION would like to see him impact the ball a bit more, and while some power did show up in his first full year, there might be more in there with a high percentage of line drives and fly balls a good indicator of what's to come in the future as he gets stronger. Added strength and better knowledge of what it takes to play a full season should help ORGANIZATION offset the fatigue he felt at the end of '18.The bat is going to have to play because of his fringe-average defense. Both his speed and his arm are scraping average, meaning he's likely destined for left (though right field would be a fit in ORGANIZATION).

It shows in his advanced approach at the plate, with the ability to control the strike zone enough to tap into his considerable raw power from both sides of the plate. He entered pro ball with a reputation as an offensive-minded backstop and though his bat is ahead of his glove, the Mariners were pleasantly surprised with his defensive tools, particularly his framing and game-calling, not to mention excellent leadership skills.The one part of his defensive game that's behind is his arm, but PERSON was on a throwing program during the offseason and worked on using his lower half more.

A dearth of college catchers further pushed him up teams' Draft boards, and the ORGANIZATION were pleased to find him available ahead of their third-round pick. The switch-hitting backstop swung the bat well in the second half of his junior season, using an advanced approach at the plate to hit for average and power while drawing a ton of walks. It's a power-over-hit profile from both sides of the plate, though some question whether PERSON will hit enough at the next level to tap consistently into that raw pop. His defensive game, however, lags behind his bat. The big-bodied catcher lacks agility behind the plate, with blocking, receiving and catch-and-throw skills that leave something to be desired. PERSON catching is always hard to find, and PERSON did it for three years at ORGANIZATION. His bat is his calling card to the ORGANIZATION and gives him a chance to develop into a offensive-minded backstop if can also make gains on the other side of the ball.",-1
"No one roots for a high school player to struggle, especially not in his Draft year. But sometimes such adversity can work to a team's advantage. Case in point is PERSON, who entered his senior year at powerhouse PERSON in GPE as one of the best prep bats in the country. When he scuffled for a chunk of the season, his stock fell and the ORGANIZATION were thrilled he slipped far enough for them to grab him in the second round with the 50th overall pick in the 2017 Draft.PERSON did look more like the hitting prospect people thought he was during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION. He has an advanced approach at the plate and drew a ton of walks, controlling the strike zone very well for his age, with the chance to be a Major League average, if not better, hitter from the left side of the plate. There is plenty of power to tap into, though trying to muscle up led to him being too pull happy in high school, one of the main reasons for his struggle. The ORGANIZATION tend to preach hit over power in the Minors, so that should be a good fit.The bat will have to play because he's an average defender with a fringy arm who is likely limited to left field as a pro. The good news is it looks like he's rediscovered his swing and should have the profile for an outfield corner spot in the future.",-1

A change in his approach this spring, perhaps to try to show more power, hurt his results. He was too pull-happy, while he was able to drive the ball to all fields previously. His bat is his carrying tool, as he is a fringy runner and an average defender in left field.PERSON's track record, rather than his senior season, is what the ORGANIZATION were banking on when they took him so early. He's now working to rediscover the approach that was so successful for him earlier in his amateur career.",-1
"A classic grinder who gets the most out of his tools, GPE improved in each of his three college seasons at ORGANIZATION. He earned all-star honors in the ORGANIZATION in 2018, a prelude to a breakout junior season in which he batted .397/.478/.651 and topped ORGANIZATION Division I with 29 doubles. PERSON's first pick (second round) in the 2019 Draft, he signed for $1.3 million as the 43rd overall choice.GPE's strong suit is his ability to make consistent line-drive contact from the right side of the plate. He manages the strike zone well and has developed reliable gap power with the potential for perhaps 15-20 homers per season if he turned his swing loose more often. He shows average speed out of the batter's box and more quickness once he gets going, but he's not much of a threat to steal.GPE played both second base and shortstop for the ORGANIZATION and spent most of his time on the Cape at third base. Though PERSON deployed him at shortstop at the beginning of his pro career, he's best suited for second base because his arm strength is merely average. He has reliable hands and his overall game has drawn some comparisons to GPE Dozier's.",-1

He has added significant velocity as a pro and averaged 14.2 strikeouts per nine innings in GPE ball during his GPE debut last year. He has continued to miss bats at a high rate while making the jump to full-season ball in '18.PERSON's fastball can be unhittable at times, usually ranging from 92-97 mph and topping out at 99 mph. Besides its velocity, his heater also stands out for its natural life, cutting and running to either side of the plate. PERSON depends heavily on his fastball because his slider is still a work in progress.Used exclusively as a reliever, PERSON has a fastball suited for high-leverage situations, but also will require a lot of development. In addition to refining his slider, he also needs to improve his control and command. While he has impressive arm speed, he also has a lot of effort in his delivery and that impedes his ability to provide consistent strikes.",-1
"Opponents pitched around PERSON so much during his 2017 senior season at ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, GPE) that he drew 57 walks, the ninth-highest total in prep history. The first position player drafted by the ORGANIZATION last June, he signed for a slightly over-slot $497,500 in the fourth round. He led the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League with 46 free passes in his pro debut, then stumbled in his 2018 encore before getting back on track in low Class A this year.PERSON has the bat speed, strength and discipline to hit for power and average from the left side of the plate. He struggled last year when he got away from his approach, but he's thriving now that he has regained his patience and is driving the ball to all fields. Unlike some prospects who pile up walks, he's not overly passive and looks to do damage when he gets a pitch to hit.A quarterback in high school, PERSON has a stocky build with deceptive athleticism. He shows fringy speed out of the batter's box but is an average runner underway. With solid arm strength, he's capable of playing either outfield corner and did some catching in high school.",-1
"PERSON was one of the better hitters in his GPE class as a GPE prep star in 2016, but concerns about his size and his lack of an obvious defensive home, on top of his strong commitment to GPE, caused him to fall to the ORGANIZATION in the 20th round. The ORGANIZATION took him in the third round two years later as a GPE-eligible sophomore, after PERSON had hit 27 home runs with a .378 OBP in two seasons with the ORGANIZATION, and signed him for a little more than $1 million. PERSON, if any, scouts, question PERSON' ability to hit. He has an innate knack for barreling the ball up from the left side and a long track record of doing it against quality competition. PERSON is listed at 5-foot-7, but he has above-average raw power and gets to it in games because his barrel control is exceptional. His frame is a bit thick, however, and PERSON has below-average speed. After manning left field in college, PERSON spent his professional debut at second base, showing fringy range but solid hands and instincts, as well as adequate arm strength. The ORGANIZATION think he can become a passable defender there -- at least good enough so any defensive shortcomings don't detract from his power-over-hit, bat-first profile.",-1
"Most of the international signings that make a splash involve six or seven figures and a 16-year-old with a ridiculous ceiling. PERSON has the ceiling right, but he signed at age 19 and received just $15,000 to sign in July 2016 out of GPE. His 2017 pro debut in the GPE League was up-and-down, but he started showing why the Royals are excited about him with a move to full-season ball in 2018, though his season was delayed by a death in the family early and cut short by some fatigue at the end of the summer. He wasn't able to make much progress in 2019, as a fractured rib suffered in GPE Training kept him off the mound until June.Projectable at 6-foot-4, PERSON is still growing into his body and his fastball. He easily sits around 94 mph and touches 97 mph regularly, with many feeling he could be sitting in the 96- to 97-mph range at some point in the future. At its best, the right-hander's curve is better than his changeup, though the latter is more consistent. With his long levers, it's hard for him to repeat his mechanics on his breaking ball, but it has the potential to be a plus pitch. He's showing an increasing ability to land all three pitches for strikes.PERSON's fatigue at the end of the year led to some minor arm issues, but those mostly stemmed from him not being physically prepared for a long season. The hope is to get him through a full season healthy, with a full slate of starts, as he continues to mature both physically and mentally to the rigors of being a starting pitcher.",-1
"PERSON signed at the relatively advanced age of 19 out of GPE and received the lowest signing bonus in the ORGANIZATION' 2016-17 international class at $15,000. He also posted a 5.49 ERA in the Rookie-level GPE League during his 2017 pro debut -- yet he has one of the highest ceiling among the system's pitchers. One club official said PERSON could rank as PERSON's best mound prospect by the end of 2018.In his first taste of pro ball, PERSON routinely worked at 94-97 mph and showed the arm speed and projectability to reach triple digits in the future. He already has an advanced changeup that could become a plus pitch and helped him limit left-handers to a .222 average in 2017. His curveball isn't as consistent but has enough power and depth to become at least an average offering. His repertoire recalls PERSON's at the same stage of their careers, but PERSON has the advantages of a bigger frame and a better delivery. He's doing a better job of repeating his mechanics this year, enhancing his chances of remaining if he remains a starter. If he continues to make the necessary refinements, he could fit into the middle of a big league rotation.",-1
"When the ORGANIZATION acquired PERSON from GPE as part of the ORGANIZATION deal in December 2015, the club knew that it was getting a raw, but highly projectable young right-hander. Just 17 at the time and fresh off of his professional debut in the ORGANIZATION, he's since made steady progress, highlighted by a promotion to Class A Wisconsin in 2017 and a return to the level the following year. PERSON has added strength to his wiry frame since signing, but it's his remaining physical projection which has the ORGANIZATION excited. His fastball has ticked up into the low 90s consistently, and he continues to show good feel for spinning a breaking ball while also making strides with a changeup. PERSON has average control of his entire arsenal, though he'll need to learn to pitch down in the zone with more consistency to be successful at higher levels.PERSON joined the ORGANIZATION in the same deal that netted the organization fellow right-hander PERSON. While PERSON has made a rise through PERSON's system this year, PERSON, with added strength and better stuff, could take a similar path.",-1

"Yet another recipient of GPE' largesse during the 2015-16 international signing period, PERSON turned pro for $350,000 out of the ORGANIZATION. His bonus was an investment in his power potential, which was evident when he homered 13 times in 52 games while batting .328/.383/.661 between two Rookie leagues in his 2016 pro debut. He made his GPE debut ahead of schedule in late July and went deep twice in the second game after his arrival.Already 6-foot-3 and 190 pounds when he turned pro, PERSON has impressive strength and loft in his right-handed swing. The ORGANIZATION have faith in his ability to hit for average as well as for power, though he'll need to do tone down his extremely aggressive approach to make consistent contact against better pitching. After coming to the ORGANIZATION, he drew two walks and struck out 30 times in 105 plate appearances.PERSON moves well for his size, though he may lose some of his presently average speed as he matures physically. He's raw defensively but could become an average right fielder with more experience. He has the solid arm strength desired at his position.",-1

"The highest-priced player in the ORGANIZATION' 2016 international class, PERSON earned a $275,000 bonus as a projectable right-hander who could reach the low 90s with his fastball at age 16. The ORGANIZATION missed 2017 with an elbow strain but caught attention by hitting triple digits with his heater while making his GPE debut last summer.PERSON is still growing into his 6-foot-3 body but already parks at 93-97 mph and touches 100 with his fastball, which has some riding life up in the strike zone. His mid-80s slider is inconsistent but can be overpowering when he stays on top of it and creates sharp bite. He mainly relies on throwing the ball by hitters at this point but will have to refine his changeup and use it more often if he remains a starter.While PERSON has a quick arm and doesn't have much effort in his delivery, he has a ways to go in terms of repeating his delivery and throwing strikes. He's too young to definitely project as a reliever, but if he does wind up in the bullpen, he could be a closer if he develops enough control and command. He still has room to add strength and could wind up sitting in the upper 90s with his fastball in shorter stints.",-1
"â¢ 7/10: PERSON returns in rehab startUndrafted out of high school, PERSON honored his commitment to ORGANIZATION and blossomed into one of the top college pitchers in the nation. His combination of stuff and control improved in each of his three years there, and he became the highest drafted player in program history when PERSON made him the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick and signed him for $7.5 million, a record in the bonus pool era. A lengthy junior campaign during which PERSON accrued 114 2/3 innings prompted the ORGANIZATION to limit his workload after signing, though it certainly didn't keep the right-hander from having an impressive pro debut that concluded with four abbreviated starts in the ORGANIZATION State League. He dominated early in his first full season, first in the ORGANIZATION and then after a promotion to Double-A PERSON, though his progress was slowed by a shoulder injury in mid-June. With plus command and the ability to induce whiffs with three different pitches, PERSON has the ingredients needed to headline a starting rotation. A plus-plus splitter in the mid-80s that dives at the plate is his best offering, and he's adept at locating the pitch down in the zone or below it. PERSON sets it up with a 92-97 mph fastball that he commands exceptionally well despite its running life. His mid-80s slider took a step forward as a junior, consistently grading as a plus offering, and he also has developed the ability to manipulate it into a harder cutter when he desires. PERSON has long shown a knack for pounding the zone and attacking hitters. He finished first in ORGANIZATION Division I in K/BB ratio (12.1) and fourth in walks per nine innings (1.0) as a sophomore and posted similar numbers as a junior while finishing third among D-I hurlers with 156 strikeouts.That PERSON was shut down in 2017 at ORGANIZATION and again in the summer with PERSON due to a tired arm and flexor strain in his forearm raises concerns about his durability. However, he did his part by staying healthy throughout his 2018 campaign, and neither his athletic frame nor his clean delivery have a glaring flaw. With his plus stuff and plus command, it should surprise no one to see him move quickly through the ORGANIZATION' system.",-1
"PERSON was too raw to get drafted out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks three years ago, but blossomed at ORGANIZATION. His combination of stuff and control put him atop most Draft boards as PERSON approached and that's exactly where he went. He became the highest drafted ORGANIZATION player in history when the ORGANIZATION took him No. 1 overall and signed him for $7.5 million, a record in the bonus pool era, but still more than $500,000 below pick value.PERSON gets swings and misses with three different pitches, the best of which is a mid-80s splitter that dives at the plate. He sets it up with a 92-97 mph fastball that he commands exceptionally well despite its running life. His mid-80s slider took a step forward this spring, consistently grading as a plus offering, and he also has developed the ability to turn it into a harder cutter when he desires.While there was some concern about his health after being shut down in 2017 at ORGANIZATION and again last summer with PERSON due to a tired arm and flexor strain in his forearm, he answered questions by staying healthy throughout his 2018 campaign and he has an athletic frame and clean delivery that shows no glaring flaw.

"Regarded by some as the best prep player from GPE in the 2016 class, ORGANIZATION impressed early on when there were general managers aplenty going to see amateur games during Spring Training. And while concerns about his signability made him a wild card headed into the GPE, the ORGANIZATION took a gamble by selecting ORGANIZATION in the 11th round, and then gave him $1.2 million, second-round money, to forgo his commitment to PERSON. After scuffling at the outset of his pro career, ORGANIZATION turned the corner during his second tour of the Rookie-level PERSON in 2018.The 6-foot-5 left-handed hitter already controls the strike zone well and shows good feel to hit, with knowledge of where the barrel of the bat needs to be. The in-game power he showed during his senior year has returned as he's grown into his large frame, and there should be even more on the way as he continues to add strength.A good athlete who also played football, ORGANIZATION began his career at the hot corner but now sees the bulk of his time at first base, where most evaluators expected him to land. His athleticism serves him well at the position, giving him above-average range and aiding him with his footwork around the bag.",-1
"In what was a down year for GPE talent in PERSON, ORGANIZATION was regarded by some as the best prep player in the state. While he impressed early on when there were general managers aplenty going to see amateur games during Spring Training, concerns about his signability made him a wild card headed into the GPE.

He showed in-game power during his senior year, and there should be more as he fills out his frame and adds strength. A good athlete who also played football, ORGANIZATION has a solid arm at third, though most see a move to first base in his future. He might be athletic enough to handle left field. Regardless, it's ORGANIZATION's offensive upside that has the ORGANIZATION excited.",-1
"PERSON spent most of his college career at GPE in the bullpen, enjoying sporadic success and seeing his stuff dip when he got a chance in the rotation as a junior. The ORGANIZATION still saw some starter potential in him and have been pleased with his initial results since drafting him in the 12th round in 2018. The lone negative on his pro rÃ©sumÃ© is a pair of positive tests for a drug of abuse, which resulted in a 50-game suspension to begin this season.In his first full year as a pro, PERSON has sat at 92-93 mph and topped out at 95 with decent life on his fastball, which parked more around 90 mph when he started for the ORGANIZATION. His best pitches are his pair of solid breaking balls, a low-80s slider with bite and an upper-70s curveball with depth. His changeup lags behind his other offerings and will need continued development if he's to remain in the rotation.At 5-foot-10, PERSON lacks the size desired in a starter but compensates by using a high-three-quarters delivery to create downhill plane. He has filled the strike zone in pro ball after battling his control at GPE, though his command may never be better than average. A potential back-of-the rotation starter, he has hit 97 mph as a reliever in the past and might have sharper breaking stuff in shorter stints.",-1
"PERSON PERSON became the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in the 2017 Draft as a shortstop at ORGANIZATION (PERSON, GPE), but the year before he played second base in deference to PERSON. PERSON became an immediate starter at second base for ORGANIZATION, where he generated first-round buzz with an outstanding sophomore season in 2018. His numbers and his stock dipped a bit last spring, allowing the GPE to sign him for $1,050,300 as a second-rounder, and he celebrated getting picked by homering seconds later in a regional playoff game.Like GPE 2018 first-rounder PERSON, PERSON has drawn offensive comparisons to PERSON. Using a compact right-handed swing, he controls the strike zone and barrels the ball exceedingly well. He's geared more for line-drive contact, but he has the bat speed and hitting ability to produce 15-20 homers per year.PERSON should hit and he'll have to if he's going to become a regular. He has fringy speed and isn't much of a factor on the bases. He has similar arm strength and range, and while he gets the job done at second base, his tools would be stretched on the left side of the infield.",-1
"GPE and raised in the GPE, GPE went to high school in GPE for several years before moving to GPE for his senior campaign in 2016. That he was part of a program for international students at a GPE school likely caused him to fly under the radar during the spring, and it looked as though GPE would go undrafted until the ORGANIZATION took him in the 39th round and signed him for $200,000. He rewarded the organization for its investment by turning in an eye-opening full-season debut in 2018. Spending the entire year in the ORGANIZATION, GPE produced a .285/.363/.445 line with 50 extra-base hits and 44 steals over 125 games at ORGANIZATION A Lansing.A switch-hitter with different profiles on each side of the plate, GPE projects to hit for more average as a lefty. He'll demonstrate an advanced approach from that side, with a swing that produces line-drive contact across the entire field. His right-handed stroke is more power-oriented, but it also comes with natural swing-and-miss tendencies. He'll draw walks from both sides and generally gets on base at an above-average clip, while his above-average speed makes him a menace on the basepaths. GPE's 44 steals tied him for third in the ORGANIZATION, but he'll need to refine his technique and do a better job reading pitchers after being thrown out 13 times.Much of GPE's future value is tied to his ability to stick in center field. He's a solid, if unspectacular defender up the middle, with good range and instincts, as well as arm strength that's among the best in the system and allows him to profile in right field. He saw near equal time at both spots last season, recording 15 outfield assists overall.",-1
"After his strong showing on the 2014 summer showcase circuit, GPE appeared poised to become a first-round pick in '15 as part of a Draft class that lacked both impact talent and depth behind the plate. But elbow concerns caused the GPE (Calif.) High graduate to fall to the second round, where the ORGANIZATION signed him above slot value for $1,482,500. In GPE, GPE underwent PERSON surgery. One year later, the 19-year-old backstop made his long awaited pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, and did so as a catcher rather than first base or designated hitter.One of the more interesting prep hitters in the 2015 class, GPE makes hard contact from the left side of the plate thanks to a smooth and controlled swing that has little wasted movement. He's physically strong and gets good use of his lower half, and scouts believe his impressive raw power could develop into above-average power.There were questions about whether GPE would stay behind the plate long-term even before the elbow surgery. When healthy, his arm strength is his best defensive tool, though he'll need to shorten his arm stroke and clean up his transfer skills. Once GPE recovers from his surgery, a true evaluation of his defensive skills can be made. But he should get to impress with the bat before then, as club officials expect him to be ready to go offensively by spring training.",-1
"GPE appeared to be poised to become PERSON's fifth first-round pick, but the ORGANIZATION, GPE area standout's elbow concerns dropped him to the second round, where the ORGANIZATION signed him for slightly above pick value. It was announced soon after that GPE needed PERSON surgery.In addition to the elbow, there were some questions about whether GPE would stay behind the plate long-term. When healthy, his arm strength is his best defensive tool, though he'll need to cut down on his long release. He had improved his overall mobility, though there's still work to be done there. Regardless of where he plays, GPE had one of the more interesting high school bats in the 2015 class. He makes hard contact from the left side of the plate and and has above-average power potential. Once GPE recovers from his surgery, a true evaluation of his defensive skills can be made. He should get to impress with the bat before then.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION were excited about PERSON's upside and feel for pitching when they went above slot to sign him in the fourth round of the 2016 Draft out of the Miami-area high school ranks. While he pitched well in his debut that summer and did reach full-season ball in '17, it's still mostly about potential for PERSON, who missed all of the '18 season with a stress reaction his back. Any hopes for progress in 2019 were dashed when he needed surgery to repair a stress fracture in his back.While all signs had pointed to a successful rehab and PERSON gave a lot of focus to conditioning, the recurrence of his back issues is concerning. The hope is that he can get back to refining the four-pitch mix that excited everyone in the organization. He throws both a live four-seam and sinking two-seam fastball, touching the upper-90s with the former at times, and backs it up with a hard slider that flashes plus. His changeup might be as good, if not better and he flips in an average curveball as well. With a relatively clean delivery, he should be a good strike-thrower.PERSON has been pinpointed as a breakout candidate ever since he was drafted. If he can get healthy and get a full season's work in, he can finally start living up to those expectations.",-1
"GPE opened many eyes before the 2016 Draft with a strong performance in the GPE state high school All-Star game, helping convince the ORGANIZATION to not only take the Miami-area right-hander in the fourth round, but to give him a well-above pick value bonus of $850,000 to sign. While some of GPE's numbers have been pedestrian, the ORGANIZATION have a hard time containing their excitement about his stuff, feel for pitching and makeup. However, the club will have to wait to see him perform in 2018 as a stress reaction in his back this spring landed him on GPE's disabled list to start the year.GPE has the chance to have a usable four-pitch mix at his disposal when all is said and done. His fastball averaged around 95 mph in 2017 and touched the upper-90s at times with good movement. The right-hander will throw an electric four-seamer and a distinct two-seam fastball that has very heavy sink. His slider might be his best secondary offering right now, a hard breaking ball that flashes plus, but he'll also show an above-average, if not better, changeup and he can mix in a more traditional curveball as well. He throws a ton of strikes and has made very good strides in refining his delivery since signing.GPE is a solid athlete who has done a very good job taking care of his body to help him maximize the considerable tools he has. He's a strong breakout candidate, one who could start moving up pitching prospect lists soon.",-1
"GPE development people know better than to get too fired up about a high school draftee after just 11 1/3 innings of professional work, so the ORGANIZATION are trying hard to temper their enthusiasm for PERSON, their fourth-round selection from the ORGANIZATION high school ranks last June. But his stuff, makeup and feel for pitching have many excited to see how his career unfolds.While PERSON's debut was brief, it was nonetheless impressive, as he missed a lot of bats and generated weak contact on the ground. He does it with a legitimate four-pitch mix. His fastball during his debut generally sat in the 91-94 range, thrown with good sink and there could be more in the tank as he matures. He has two distinct breaking pitches. His slider is less polished than the curve, but they don't run into each other and both eventually could be at least average. He has plus feel for his changeup and, at least in the early going, he threw all of them for quality strikes thanks to his ability to repeat his delivery well.With his aptitude and maturity, the temptation will be to rush PERSON, but the ORGANIZATION will want to manage his innings and give him time to focus on getting physically stronger. It would surprise no one internally if he's the best pitching prospect in the system before too long.",-1

But he missed all of 2018 after hurting his throwing shoulder and having rotator-cuff surgery, then played just 21 games this year before injuring his left shoulder sliding into a base and requiring season-ending labrum surgery.With PERSON's size, bat speed and developing strength, he has more power than the typical shortstop. To get the most out of his power potential and hit for average, he'll have to improve his plate discipline and guard against his right-handed swing getting too long. He has the plus speed and aggressive mindset to steal bases.Assuming his arm bounces back, PERSON has all the tools to remain at shortstop.

He rounds out his repertoire with a hard curveball and a changeup that has been effective against lower-level hitters.The key to PERSON's future will be his ability to throw strikes, which never has been his strong suit. His control has been much better in his second year in pro ball than it was in his first, and he also has tightened up his breaking pitches. He hit 98 mph with his fastball in short stints in college, giving a hint of what he could become as a reliever.",-1
"After leading PERSON (ORGANIZATION, Fla.) to its second state 4-A baseball championship title in three years, PERSON appeared headed to PERSON after he went unpicked on the first day of the 2019 Draft. He was on campus in GPE Rouge beginning the process of enrolling in school when the GPE called and offered him late second-round money ($955,000) in the fourth round, which changed his mind. The son of 17-year big leaguer PERSON, he began his pro career sharing shortstop with 2019 second-rounder PERSON in GPE ball.PERSON offers more offensive potential if not quite the same defensive brilliance as GPE. A right-handed hitter, he handles the bat well, understands the strike zone and makes repeated line-drive contact. If he adds some needed strength, he could develop into a .270 hitter with gap power.Growing up around the game helped PERSON develop a high baseball IQ and he has more advanced instincts than most players his age. He makes the most of his average speed on the bases and puts himself in position to make plays at shortstop. He has quick hands and solid arm strength, tools that will allow him to play anywhere in the infield.",-1
"Taken by the ORGANIZATION in the 14th round of the 2016 Draft, PERSON is a physical right-hander who compensates for fringy stuff with late movement and advanced pitchability. It's why the organization felt comfortable turning to him when Double-A PERSON needed a spot start in late May, and again with PERSON Class A St. Lucie the following week. Those two outings aside, PERSON spent his age-20 season in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League, posting a 2.01 ERA over 71 2/3 innings while making 13 starts. PERSON' fastball sits at 89-91 mph with plus sinking action that helped him induce ground-ball contact at a 58 percent clip in 2018. His curveball is an above-average offering as well as a potential out-pitch for him, and he also demonstrates feel for throwing a fading changeup in the mid-80s. PERSON already understands how to sequence his pitches and is consistently around the strike zone. PERSON strong and durable, PERSON completed at least five innings in 10 of his 15 starts in '18. The ORGANIZATION have a track record of developing mid-to-late round high school pitchers that have average stuff but good feel for their craft. PERSON certainly fits that description, and the organization believes he has the qualities needed to reach the big leagues as a back-end starter.",-1
"After signing for $800,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in August 2015, PERSON cut his right arm in a household accident and delayed his pro debut until '17. The ORGANIZATION tried to jump him to the short-season LOCATION for his GPE debut last summer at age 19, but that proved to be too much for him. He did a better job of showcasing his all-around tools in the Rookie-level PERSON League.PERSON has some of the best bat speed in the system but will need to add more muscle to his skinny frame before he can translate it into power. He has a nice right-handed swing and bat-to-ball skills, but his ORGANIZATION experience showed he'll need to refine his approach at the plate. An average runner out of the batter's box, he's a step quicker once he gets going.PERSON's athleticism and solid arm strength give him a number of defensive options. He broke into pro ball as a shortstop and may have enough quickness to stay there. He spent the majority of his time in 2018 at third base and the ORGANIZATION believe he may be able to handle center field in the future.",-1
"PERSON reportedly had an agreement in place with the ORGANIZATION on a $2.1 million signing bonus well before the 2014 international period began, but the deal never came to fruition, which allowed the ORGANIZATION to land the then-17-year-old for $375,000. He made his GPE debut two years later with PERSON's Rookie-level ORGANIZATION affiliate and advanced to Class A Short-Season in 2017, excelling in the second half after a slow start. It will now be up to the ORGANIZATION to further PERSON' development after they acquired him, PERSON and PERSON in December in the ORGANIZATION trade. The switch-hitting PERSON shows more impact potential from the left side of the plate, the side from which he hit five of his six FACILITY home runs (all coming during the second half). Equally impressive was his progress as a righty, especially considering there was talk about him scrapping switch-hitting prior to the season. PERSON could hit for a solid average as well as some power with additional gains in each batter's box, while his above-average speed should net him plenty of doubles and triples as well as stolen bases.On the other side of the ball, PERSON draws raves for his upside at shortstop, where he projects as a plus defender with plenty of range and arm strength for the position. He also receives high marks for his intensity and leadership, both on and off the field. PERSON will need time to develop, but the profile could be that of an everyday middle-infielder who contributes in all facets of the game.",-1

PERSON' power could increase as develops physically, and his contact skills and above-average speed should net him plenty of doubles and triples. Meanwhile, his plate discipline proved to be more advanced than expected during his 2015 professional debut in the ORGANIZATION.

He also receives high praise for his intensity and leadership qualities at the position. Should PERSON not be able to stick at the position, his skill sets would also be a fit at second base.

"The best prospect to come out of ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, Ga.), a program that has produced big leaguers PERSON and PERSON, and 2010 first-rounder PERSON, PERSON' speed and athleticism set him apart from most others in the 2019 Draft, and he was also viewed as one of the better prep hitters in the class. Those qualities and PERSON' overall high ceiling made him the ORGANIZATION' top target, and they signed PERSON's 2019 GPE high school player of the year for below slot value at $5.2 million, after selecting him with the ORGANIZATION. 6 overall pick. He quickly rewarded the organization with a torrid start to his career in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON has game-changing speed, uses his quickness to beat out bunts and grounders and has the instincts to develop into a premium basestealer. He has a quick left-handed stroke and controls the bat very well, making consistent contact and using the entire field. While he won't be a slugger, he looked a little more physical during this spring and has the bat speed and deceptive strength to hit 10-15 homers on an annual basis.The biggest question with PERSON is where he'll eventually make his defensive home. He has solid arm strength and a chance to stick at shortstop, but doesn't have the most fluid actions and might fit better at second base or center field. He draws comparisons to PERSON, though he has considerably more pop than the former batting and stolen-base champ.",-1
"As the 2017 GPE approached, many felt PERSON, a GPE high school standout, was set on heading to the ORGANIZATION of GPE for college. The ORGANIZATION, never ones to shy away from aggressively acquiring prep pitchers in the GPE, knew he was signable, and went just a bit above slot to sign him for $300,000 in the sixth round. He was able to advance to full season ball in 2018, though he was shut down in July with forearm tightness.PERSON is healthy and back on track for 2019 so he can get back to developing his interesting three-pitch mix. He'll actually throw a pair of fastballs in the 90-95 mph range, a two-seamer with sink that can elicit weak contact on the ground as well as a four-seamer. As he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame, there could be more velocity to come. Like many young pitchers, his secondary stuff still needs work, but his feel for his slider and changeup all point to them being at least solid average pitches in the future. There's not a lot of track record, but PERSON has thus far filled up the strike zone consistently.A tireless worker, PERSON could be poised to make a large jump up this list as he continues to refine his stuff and mature physically and mentally. The key in 2019 will be to get in a full season's worth of healthy innings.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION took three high school pitchers in the top 10 rounds of the 2017 Draft. PERSON and PERSON were the team's top two selections. PERSON, a product of the LOCATION prep ranks, went in the sixth round, and while many thought he was unsignable away from his ORGANIZATION commitment, the ORGANIZATION were able to get him for $300,000, just a bit over pick value. Somewhat surprisingly, PERSON is the only one of the three to start his 2018 season in full-season ball, albeit after hanging back in extended spring camp. Projectable at 6-foot-3, his stuff has already taken a nice step forward since entering pro ball. PERSON will throw both a two- and four-seam fastball, 90-95 mph, with the potential for there to be more in the tank. His secondary stuff is developing, but both his slider and his changeup have the chance to be solid- to a tick-above-average offerings in the future.The ORGANIZATION rave about PERSON's makeup, a reason why he was able to make the jump to the LOCATION. Outside of a trip to the disabled list because of forearm tightness in GPE, he has a big up arrow next to his name.",-1
"After displaying first-round potential on the high school showcase circuit in 2016, PERSON was hampered by a broken hamate bone in his right hand last spring. The ORGANIZATION took him in the second round and lured him away from a ORGANIZATION commitment with an over-slot $1.3 million bonus. He's the best athlete and fastest player in a system thinned by promotions and trades in recent years.PERSON has well-above-average speed and knows how to use it to reach base and create havoc once he does. He employs a compact left-handed swing geared to produce line drives and ground balls that he can beat out. He draws walks but can get too passive at times, and his inability to drive the ball in 2018 points to his need for increased strength.PERSON's quickness also plays well in center field. He could cover plenty of ground on speed alone, but he also has fine instincts and takes good routes. His average arm is better than most at his position.",-1

Though he didn't go quite that high after a senior season in which he broke the hamate bone in his right hand, he still commanded an above-slot $1.3 million bonus in the second round to give up a scholarship from PERSON. He's one of the top all-around athletes in a system that has been ravaged by trades in the last two years.PERSON's best tool is his well above-average speed. He uses his quickness to reach base, steal bases once he does and track down flyballs from gap to gap. His instincts and direct routes enhance his defensive prowess in center field, and his average arm stands out as better than most at his position.At the plate, PERSON has a compact left-handed swing designed to produces line drives from gap to gap. He has more strength and bat speed than most speedsters, showing some promising power to his pull side. If he reaches his offensive ceiling, he could be a .270 hitter with 15 homers and 30 steals per season.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION are very excited about PERSON, a high school pitcher they got in the fourth round of last year's Draft. They are nearly as intrigued with GPE, the prep arm they selected two rounds later.GPE has less polish than PERSON currently, but the finished product has the chance to be pretty good. In a small sample size, he threw the makings of a three-pitch mix, in the strike zone, missing a decent amount of bats and inducing weak contact. His fastball is his best pitch right now and while it's only 90-91 mph right now, GPE throws it with a lot of life and given his athletic and projectable body, there's a good chance there's more velocity to come. His curveball has the chance to be an excellent breaking ball, though it's inconsistent right now. So is his changeup, but he did show some feel for it during his brief debut.It may take some time for GPE to put things together as he focuses on gaining strength. But when he does, he could move up this list in a hurry. He and PERSON already showed they like to push each other and compete, which can only be a good thing.",-1
"A projectable, athletic left-hander, GPE draws comparisons to a young PERSON and modeled his delivery after him. He'll get a chance to one day join him in the PERSON rotation after the ORGANIZATION drafted him 30th overall and signed him for $2,003,400 last June. The club plans on bringing him along slowly and had him pitch just 7 2/3 innings in his pro debut.GPE has the potential for three solid-or-better pitches. His fastball currently sits around 90 mph and tops out at 94, but he figures to add more velocity when he gets stronger and already misses a lot of bats because it features a high spin rate that creates riding life. His curveball has downer action when he stays on top of it and could turn into a plus offering if it adds more power as expected, and his changeup has similar upside but less consistency.GPE has a sound delivery and uses a high three-quarters arm slot to create downhill plane. He does a good job of repeating his mechanics, though his command still wavers, as is true of most young pitchers. If he can add the necessary polish, he could become the most well-rounded lefty starter among PERSON' deep group of southpaw mound prospects.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION not only have PERSON in their rotation, but also the next version of him coming through their system in GPE, who patterned his delivery after the four-time All-Star's and started earning comparisons to him in high school. Signed for $2,003,400 as the 30th overall pick in 2016, he topped the short-season LOCATION in strikeouts (87) last summer and easily would have led in strikeout rate (13.7 per nine innings) if he had enough innings to qualify. His encore will be delayed until 2019, however, because he was diagnosed with an elbow injury during Spring Training that required PERSON surgery.GPE' fastball sits in the low 90s and peaks at 95 mph, but it plays as a plus pitch because it features a high spin rate that creates riding life and he also hides it well. He added some velocity during his first full year of pro ball and could pick up more as he continues to strengthen his lean frame. His changeup is similarly effective and his downer curveball should become a solid third pitch once it develops more power.GPE has sound mechanics and employs a high three-quarters arm slot to create downhill plane. Though he's athletic and repeats his delivery, his control and command are still works in progress. He walked 5.7 batters per nine innings in his first two pro seasons, and if he can pound the strike zone more efficiently once he returns to health, he could become a No. 2 starter.",-1
"GPE PERSON (ORGANIZATION, Fla.) has produced four quality prospects in the last three GPE, starting with PERSON third-round outfielder PERSON and GPE fourth-round left-hander PERSON in 2014. Right-hander ORGANIZATION (PERSON's brother) fell to the ORGANIZATION in the 22nd round in 2015 only because he was intent on attending PERSON, while PERSON became the highest pick of them all -- 30th overall as a first-rounder this June. He turned down the ORGANIZATION to sign for $2,003,400.PERSON works with three pitches, all of which should become at least solid offerings. His 89-91 mph fastball tops out at 93 and plays better than its radar-gun readings because he commands it well and delivers it on a steep downhill plane. His curveball has downer action when he stays on top of it and could become a plus pitch if it adds more power as he gains strength, while he's improving the quality of and his trust in his changeup.His athletic frame still has a lot of projection remaining it and garners him comparisons to a young PERSON. PERSON has a sound delivery that he repeats easily. With his stuff, savvy and mound presence, he has what it takes to become a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"PERSON drew comparisons to PERSON but not the commensurate amount of GPE buzz as a GPE high school senior in 2018. An injury to his non-throwing shoulder and a strong commitment to ORGANIZATION clouded his status a bit and dropped him to the 77th overall pick, where he signed for an over-slot $1.2 million. He has one of the highest offensive ceilings of any position player in the system.PERSON added noticeable strength in 2018 and could become a .300 hitter with 25-homer power if everything comes together for him. He has advanced bat-to-ball skills and a quick left-handed swing that produces impressive exit velocities, though he has been overly aggressive during his first full pro season. He's presently a solid runner with the savvy to steal a few bases.Some scouts wonder if PERSON will lose a half-step as he continues to mature physically, which could prompt a move from center field. The ORGANIZATION like his defensive instincts and his chances to remain in center. His arm may fit better in left field than in right if he has to shift to a corner, though he'd still fit the offensive profile at either spot.",-1
"PERSON's combination of hitting ability and athleticism were enticing, but his Draft status was clouded this spring by an injury to his non-throwing shoulder and his strong commitment to ORGANIZATION. Undaunted, the ORGANIZATION selected him in the supplemental second round and signed him for an over-slot $1.2 million. He made an easy transition to pro ball by getting off to a hot start in the Rookie-level PERSON. PERSON has a mature and disciplined approach for his age, using a compact left-handed swing to smoke the ball to all fields. With his bat speed, developing strength and the loft he added to his stroke this spring, he should develop average or better power. He also has solid speed and could become a 20-20 player.His quickness plays well in center field, where PERSON's instincts help him chase down balls from gap to gap. He has average arm strength, more than enough for center. Though he was the third hitter PERSON drafted in 2018, he may have more upside than first-rounder PERSON or second-rounder PERSON.",-1
"The PERSON family clearly grows pitchers. PERSON, a lefty, was a fourth-round pick of the ORGANIZATION out of high school. Younger brother PERSON went the college route, serving as a starter for PERSON for three years before landing in the fifth round of the 2018 Draft. After the right-hander dealt with some biceps tendinitis during his junior year, the ORGANIZATION erred on the side of caution and didn't have PERSON pitch after they signed him and he made his pro debut in 2019, earning a promotion from the ORGANIZATION to the PERSON League at the end of May.PERSON has a solid three-pitch mix with the ability to throw all three for strikes. He can run his fastball up to 96 mph and it's been showing more play up in the zone than the sink he showed in college. He'll throw a curveball in the 74-78 mph range with a big three-quarter break to it that's been rapidly improving in terms of his ability to land it for strikes. His above-average changeup has also gotten consistent swings and misses. The right-hander has thrown a ton of strikes in his pro debut, continuing to go right after hitters. He might have a slightly limited ceiling, but he's looking more and more like a future solid back-end big league starter.",-1
"Many thought PERSON, the top high school position player in GPE, would go in the top two rounds of the 2016 Draft. He slid to the third, much to the delight of the ORGANIZATION, who used their bonus pool flexibility to sign him for $1.1 million, nearly $300,000 above pick value.The PERSON state player of the year in GPE this spring could have average or better tools across the board. A shortstop in high school, the ORGANIZATION let PERSON stay there during his pro debut, but most see a move in his future. He lacks the quickness and arm strength to stay at short long-term, but should be able to handle a shift to second or third, both offensively and defensively. He has a quick, compact right-handed stroke that sends line drives to all fields. Added strength as a senior led to more power, which should play at the next level. He's an average runner with good baserunning instincts.PERSON gets high marks for his makeup and work ethic and was called a poor man's version of the ORGANIZATION' PERSON by one scout. The ORGANIZATION wouldn't mind it at all if PERSON developed into that kind of performer at the big league level.",-1
"The top high school player in the state of GPE, PERSON slipped to the first pick of Day 2 of the 2016 Draft, getting nearly $300,000 above pick value to sign with the ORGANIZATION. He hasn't consistently shown the offensive tools that made him a desirable prep bat during his pro debut, though he has shown flashes that have the ORGANIZATION excited to see what he can do long-term.While the infielder's skills with the bat haven't often been on display, the ORGANIZATION have seen plenty of bat speed from the right-handed hitter. There's going to be leverage as well, which will lead to more consistent power. PERSON played shortstop, his position in high school, during his pro debut, but moved to third at instructs and at the ORGANIZATION' GPE academy. That's his defensive home moving forward, with good hands and plenty of arm for the position.All PERSON needs are reps at the hot corner to get comfortable there.

He added a low-80s slider during his high school senior season, and it has already shown flashes of becoming a wipeout pitch. He gets good fading action on his changeup, which should improve as he uses it more against pro hitters.PERSON's athleticism should allow him to repeat his clean delivery and maintain his quality stuff deep into games. But in his first taste of pro ball, he hasn't looked like the guy who was supposed to be more advanced than most pitchers his age.

While his strikeout rate has gone up, so has his ability to draw walks, and he started tapping into his power more in 2018, with the ability to drive the ball to all fields from the right side of the plate. While speed isn't a part of his game, he's far from a clogger, with good instincts on the basepaths.PERSON has more than enough arm to profile well at third and his hands should allow him to stay there. His lack of speed might eventually be an impediment.

He finished among the ORGANIZATION leaders with 22 home runs (third) and slugging (.482), and paced all Indians farmhands with 73 runs scored. While he reversed that script in 2018, hitting well early and scuffling late, the ORGANIZATION saw enough to get him and PERSON in a trade for PERSON Mercado.PERSON has already made strides as a professional in cleaning up his left-handed swing, a good sign for any young hitter. Those adjustments helped PERSON tap into his plus power in full-season ball, as he showed that he could hit the ball out to the deepest part of any ballpark with his combination of strength, bat speed and an improved bat path. And although PERSON's uptick in power resulted in more strikeouts, he continued to recognize spin as part of a mature approach while also making plenty of hard contact. PERSON's above-average speed and strong instincts are qualifiers for him on the basepaths and in center field, and he has the arm strength -- he generated 90-mph fastballs off the mound in high school -- to play either corner spot. He saw time at all three outfield positions in 2017. PERSON stands to offer the most value if he can remain up the middle, where his power-speed combo would be a premium, but he also should produce enough to profile as a regular in either right or left.",-1
"PERSON took a huge step forward at FACILITY (ORGANIZATION, GPE) last spring, though doubts regarding the GPE-commit senior's signability persisted leading up to the GPE. The ORGANIZATION ended up taking him in the fifth round and then surprised many when they signed PERSON for pick value. PERSON's left-handed swing needs to be ironed out, but he already recognizes pitches well and has a knack for barreling the ball. After failing homer last season in his pro debut, PERSON has started to tap into his power in full-season ball in 2017, leading scouts to project him for at least average power. He has the speed and instincts to play center field, as well as the necessary arm strength -- he generated 90-mph fastballs off the mound in high school -- to play either corner spot. Previously rated as a 55 runner on the 20-80 scouting scale, he has improved his speed by at least a full grade and some evaluators give him a 70.Scouts praise PERSON's makeup, billing him as a grinder with tools. Meanwhile, the fact that center field is a particularly deep position in GPE's system gives the organization ample time to develop him in the ORGANIZATION.",-1
"The son of former big leaguer PERSON, a pitcher who appeared in 49 games over parts of three seasons, and the godson of PERSON, PERSON showed scouts everything they wanted to see from him as a high school senior in 2016, leading to his selection in the fifth round by GPE. After ranking among the ORGANIZATION leaders with 22 home runs (third) and pacing all Indians farmhands with 73 runs scored in his first full season, PERSON took a step back in 2018 and became PERSON property in July when they acquired him and PERSON for PERSON. With his combination of strength, bat speed and an improved bat path, PERSON showed in his first full season that he could hit the ball out to the deepest part of any ballpark, albeit at the cost of more swing-and-miss. In 2018, he made a concerted effort to make more contact and utilized a shorter, less-fluid swing that in turn zapped both his raw and game power, as he followed up his 22-homer campaign by tallying 34 extra-base hits over 118 games in Class A Advanced. PERSON's above-average speed and strong instincts are qualifiers for him on the basepaths and in center field, and he has the arm strength -- he generated 90-mph fastballs off the mound in high school -- to play either corner spot. His bat, however, profiles best up the middle, as any move to a corner would come with a higher threshold for production.",-1
"PERSON is the son of PERSON, one of four big league pitchers on GPE' 1983 College World Series championship club. PERSON took a huge step forward at FACILITY (ORGANIZATION, GPE) during the spring, though doubts regarding the ORGANIZATION commit's signability persisted leading up to the GPE. The ORGANIZATION ended up taking him in the fifth round, and then surprised many when they signed him for pick value.Scouts praise PERSON's makeup, billing him as a grinder with tools. He dedicated himself to conditioning during the fall and winter and emerged as a significantly stronger and faster player. Previously rated as a 55 runner on the 20-80 scouting scale, he has improved his speed by at least a full grade and some evaluators give him a 70.PERSON doesn't have the prettiest left-handed swing, but he recognizes pitches well and repeatedly barrels balls. More of a gap-to-gap hitter at this point, he might develop average power when he starts turning on more pitches. Though he has the speed and instincts to play center field, PERSON deploys him in right field, where he has a strong arm that has delivered 90-mph fastballs off the mound.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION went high school heavy at the top of the 2017 Draft, taking a prep player with each of their first four picks. PERSON, a former high school quarterback who focused on baseball after his sophomore year, was the fourth of that quartet to be taken. The ORGANIZATION only got to see him play two games in the ORGANIZATION during his pro debut with a hamstring injury ending his summer after just seven at-bats.PERSON did return to health in time to head to the organization's instructs in the ORGANIZATION, where he was able to play for a couple of weeks before embarking on his offseason plan. The outfielder is more power over hit at this point, with some strength and leverage in his right-handed swing. In the past, he's had some mechanical issues with that swing, but he smoothed some of that during his senior year and showed he is capable of driving the ball to all fields. A solid athlete who runs fairly well, PERSON played center field in high school. He's likely to mostly play in an outfield corner as a pro, where his plus arm, not to mention his power profile, will play very well.",-1
"After giving up a potential future as a college football quarterback following his sophomore year, PERSON's baseball stock took off and he developed into one of the toolsier high school players in the 2017 Draft class. The ORGANIZATION got him in the ORGANIZATION, but his pro debut ended with a hamstring injury in just his second Gulf Coast League game.When healthy, PERSON's bat speed, strength and leverage give him some serious raw power. He struggled a bit last summer on the showcase circuit, as an arm bar in his right-handed swing contributed to him getting out of sync. He was able to refine his mechanics during his senior season though, and was more consistent as a result, using the entire field and quieting concerns about his ability to hit enough to tap into that power.PERSON runs well, though he could lose a half-step as he fills out. A center fielder in high school, he played right in his one game in the field in the ORGANIZATION, where his plus arm would play extremely well. He'll get the chance to truly show what he can do in 2018.",-1
"H.B. PERSON in GPE has churned out more than its fair share of GPE talent, none more famous than ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION. More recently, it produced outfielder PERSON, who went No. 5 in the 2015 GPE to the ORGANIZATION and is one of the top prospects in baseball. As a senior, PERSON batted .526 with five homers in 20 games and helped lead Plant to the Region 2 Final in the ORGANIZATION 8A Baseball Championship. The ORGANIZATION made him their first-round pick in June, selecting PERSON 13th overall, and then signed him away from a GPE commitment with a $4,038,200 bonus. PERSON gets has the makings of a five-tool player and receives some comps to GPE, albeit with less power and more speed. The latter is currently his standout tool, and he uses it to get down the line in a hurry and run down balls in center field. PERSON has really good hands to hit and some believe the 6-foot-4 left-handed hitter will add power once he starts incorporating his lower half more consistently. He can defend in the outfield to go along with a plus arm that produced a fastball up to 93 mph as well as a decent curve on the mound as a prep.With his speed and power potential, PERSON has drawn comparisons to GPE outfielder PERSON as well as current PERSON, PERSON. The club believes PERSON can remain in center field long term and see him as someone who could move relatively quickly given his advanced bat.",-1
"The latest standout from ORGANIZATION (Tampa), which produced ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION and nine other big leaguers, PERSON was the first outfielder taken in the first round by the PERSON since PERSON in 2010. ORGANIZATION officials see some parallels between PERSON and PERSON, who signed for $4,038,200 as the 13th overall pick in the 2018 Draft. Though he didn't post big numbers in his pro debut, PERSON felt he was advanced enough to push to low Class A for the final month of the season.PERSON has the makings of a five-tool player and also draws comparisons to PERSON. The PERSON felt PERSON's left-handed swing was pretty polished for a high school hitter, though they would like to see him turn on more pitches and tap into his solid raw power after he used more of an opposite-field approach in his debut. He has a lofty offensive ceiling but will have to make more contact to reach it.PERSON has a funky running style yet has well above-average speed. He can go get the ball in center field and use his quickness to chase down balls from gap to gap. He also has a plus arm that delivered fastballs up to 93 mph and decent curveballs when he pitched in high school.",-1
"From a physical standpoint, PERSON, with his 5-foot-10 frame, didn't jump off the page as a GPE prospect. But the ORGANIZATION high schooler hit at pretty much every stop on the summer showcase circuit last year to establish himself as one of the top prep bats in the country and did nothing to diminish those evaluations during his senior spring. The D-backs, owners of seven of the first 75 picks in the 2019 GPE, selected PERSON with the ORGANIZATION. 15 overall pick and signed him away from a ORGANIZATION commitment with a slot-value bonus. PERSON's approach was among the best in his GPE class, especially among high school hitters. He can spray the ball to all fields from the left side of the plate, but as he did most noticeably during his ORGANIZATION All-American PERSON performance, he can drive the ball with line-drive loft and surprising pop. His outstanding speed helps him on both sides of the ball, with the ability to steal bases and play an outstanding defensive center field.PERSON has drawn comparisons to hitters like PERSON and PERSON, slightly undersized left-handed hitters who grew into their power at the next level. The D-backs believe PERSON could follow in that path after beginning his pro career in the ORGANIZATION.",-1
"Better known as a catcher, PERSON created a stir among scouts when he took the mound at a 2014 Area Code Games tryout and flashed a 97-mph fastball and a curveball with depth. He entered this year with the chance to go early in the Draft as a pitcher, but his mechanics were a mess and his performance disappointing during the spring. The FACILITY opted to draft him for the power in his bat rather than his arm, signing him for an above-slot $510,000 in the sixth round.With the strength in his massive 6-foot-4, 240-pound frame, PERSON can drive balls a long way. He's more slugger than hitter right now, so he'll need to make adjustments to his approach to tap into his power on a consistent basis. His home run ceiling ranks among the best in GPE's system.PERSON has to learn a new position because he immediately converted from catcher to first base after turning pro. He has uncommon arm strength for the position and could make the throws from third base, but he lacks the quickness for the hot corner.",-1
" GPE (Ga.) PERSON in GPE last had a first-round pick come from its baseball program back in 2008 when PERSON was the GPE. 1 overall pick. PERSON went nine picks later, GPE. 10 overall, in the 2015 Draft, but has the chance to be more of an impact hitter than PERSON has become.PERSON has the tools and approach to hit for power and average. He offers bat speed, strength and patience from the left side of the plate. He uses the entire field and has better pitch recognition than most high schoolers. A shortstop in high school, he didn't have the quickness to play in the middle infield. Some thought he'd profile well at the hot corner, but the ORGANIZATION sent him out as a left fielder for his pro debut.Regardless of what position PERSON settles into, it's his bat the ORGANIZATION were buying and is what should allow him to climb the organizational ladder.",-1
"Back in 2015, PERSON approached the Draft as one of the best pure hitters in the class, especially among the high school set. The ORGANIZATION drafted him accordingly, taking him No. 10 overall in the first round. After a solid pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, he's struggled to gain much traction. He did spend the 2018 season in Double-A, but hasn't been able to fully figure out what kind of hitter he is.PERSON has shown glimpses of the hitter everyone thought he could be. In his three full seasons of pro ball, he's had fairly extreme first-half/second-half splits, always taking a long time to get going, but posting a .279 second half average over those three years. When he's going well, as he did again in July and August in GPE last year, he has a good, quick bat from the left side of the plate with some pull power. Originally an infielder, the move to left field has been an adventure at times, but the ORGANIZATION feel he'll be an adequate defender.One problem is that PERSON has gotten caught in between what kind of hitter he is, starting out as a pure hitter, then changing his approach to tap into more power. The ORGANIZATION are hopeful that a new hitting program and instructor will help the still-young PERSON figure it out and find some consistency at the plate.",-1
"PERSON was thought of as one of the best pure high school hitters in the 2015 Draft class and wowing the ORGANIZATION in a workout cemented his place as the ORGANIZATION. 10 overall pick, nine spots after fellow PERSON alum PERSON went in 2008. PERSON rewarded the ORGANIZATION' faith in him by leading the ORGANIZATION in ORGANIZATION during his debut, though his development was slowed in 2016 with a shouler injury that forced him out of action for two months.It will be PERSON's bat that will get him to the big leagues, and it has the chance to be a special one. He has a very advanced approach at the plate, especially for his age, with outstanding plate discipline from the left side of the plate. He can hit the ball with authority to all fields and will hit for power, thanks to outstanding bat speed. A shortstop in high school, the ORGANIZATION moved PERSON to left field for his debut and that's likely where he'll stay. That's the part of his game that needs the most work, but he should be capable enough in left for the long term.Assuming PERSON continues to adjust to life in the outfield well, his bat could push him up the ORGANIZATION' ladder fairly quickly.",-1
"It's been a little tough to get a true read on who PERSON is as a professional player ever since he was the ORGANIZATION. 10 overall pick in the 2015 Draft from the same GPE high school that produced former ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick PERSON. He was thought to be the best pure prep hitter in that 2015 class and he hit like it during his summer debut in the ORGANIZATION. A shoulder injury interrupted his first full season, though he still showed a solid approach, then he shifted gears and started showing more power in a healthy 2017. He did not take that with him for much of the 2018 season in GPE, though he was swinging the bat better in the second half of the season.The increased power output was by design, as PERSON changed his hitting philosophy, going from a middle-to-opposite field approach type of hitter to one who learned how to turn on pitches and pull them out of the park. While he still drew walks, his strikeout rate spiked and his average suffered, but learning to drive the ball to the right-center gap and out will serve him well as he tries to reincorporate his natural tendency to use all fields. PERSON is going to have to hit because he is limited to left field only. He won't ever be a ORGANIZATION, but he's worked to be adequate there.As a corner outfielder, his ability to hit and hit for power become that much more important. He didn't put up the big numbers some expected in GPE, but if he can put the two versions of himself together, he still has time to develop into a run-producing threat.",-1
"Taken No. 10 overall as perhaps the best pure high school bat in the 2015 Draft class, PERSON had a big debut that summer in the ORGANIZATION. He wasn't able to back it up with a move to full-season ball in 2016, with a shoulder injury knocking him out of action for two months and perhaps keeping him from tapping into his offensive potential.At times during his disappointing first full season, the ORGANIZATION saw what amateur scouts saw in PERSON in the ORGANIZATION high school ranks. He had a good feel to hit with a middle-opposite field approach while learning to pull and drive the ball more on the inner third of the plate and taking a fair share of walks. He has a strong, compact body that can lend itself to inflexibility, so he will have to continue to work on his conditioning. A young player who loves to hit, PERSON is beginning to understand the need to play on both sides of the ball, and the former infielder was more invested in his outfield play as the year went on. He has the chance to be an average defender.More than anything, the ORGANIZATION wanted to see a healthy PERSON in 2017. After a slow start, he started to show more of his offensive potential in the ORGANIZATION State League.",-1
"PERSON wasn't highly regarded coming out of the ORGANIZATION, signing for $10,000 in March 2015, 20 months after he first became eligible. The ORGANIZATION kept him in GPE ball for his first two pro seasons before he made his full-season debut in 2017 and helped low Class A Quad Cities win the ORGANIZATION championship. PERSON features some of the best pitchability among the ORGANIZATION' younger pitching prospects. His pair of quality breaking balls and his ability to mix and spot his pitches allowed him to average 12.0 strikeouts per nine innings this season. His fastball usually ranges from 88-91 mph and tops out at 93, and he also shows aptitude for employing his changeup.Because he doesn't have a lot of projection in his 6-foot-1 frame, PERSON probably will have average fastball velocity at best. He'll need to challenge hitters more often at higher levels after his walk rate rose to a career-high 4.1 per nine innings in 2017. If he can't make it as a back-of-the-rotation starter, his slider and curveball could make him a useful right-on-right reliever.",-1
"Like several of the ORGANIZATION' best international pitching prospects, PERSON didn't receive a lavish bonus. He turned pro for $10,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in March 2015, 20 months after he first became eligible to sign. He performed well in short spurts during his first three pro seasons, recording a 2.35 ERA while PERSON limited him to no more than 60 frames per year.PERSON averaged 11.5 strikeouts per nine innings during that time frame despite operating with a fastball that ranges from 88-93 mph. His heater has a high spin rate that causes hitters to continually swing under it, and they also have trouble solving his solid pair of breaking pitches, a downer curveball and a more sweepy slider. His changeup is more of a work in progress, though his willingness to use it will help in its development.PERSON doesn't have much projection in his 6-foot-1 frame, so he probably will have average fastball velocity at best. After his walk rate jumped to a career-worst 4.1 per nine innings in 2017, he'll have to guard against nibbling at the strike zone too much as he rises through the Minors. He still has to prove he's durable enough to log a full season of starts, and if he can't his curveball and slider could make him a useful right-on-right reliever.",-1
"PERSON was a fairly anonymous signee out of the ORGANIZATION in June 2015, turning pro for $10,000 a full 20 months after he first became eligible. He has performed well everywhere he has gone in the Minors, logging a 2.49 ERA with 361 strikeouts in 278 1/3 innings in his first four seasons. He began 2019 by dominating in the early going in high Class A, then continued to thrive in Double-A.Despite working with an 88-93 mph fastball that tops out at 96, PERSON regularly misses bats. His heater features tremendous shape and a high spin rate that creates riding action, so hitters constantly swing under it. He also can dodge barrels with a pair of solid breaking balls, a downer curveball and a sweeping slider.PERSON has overmatched right-handers at lower levels but will need to improve his changeup to handle more advanced left-handers. He has yet to prove he can throw consistent strikes, which he'll have to do in order to remain in the rotation. If he moves to the bullpen, he could be an asset as a multi-inning reliever.",-1
"The epitome of the potential five-tool center fielder, PERSON was ranked No. 14 on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 international prospects list in 2015 when the ORGANIZATION signed him for $1.4 million. While his upside is tremendous, he showed his tools already play in games, splitting time between the ORGANIZATION and GPE Leagues during his pro debut.Despite playing at just age 17, PERSON already showed improved strength from when he signed. He also showed a solid approach at the plate, especially for someone his age. He made consistent hard contact without a ton of swing and miss. While he didn't show much power in his pro debut, there is raw pop to tap into, something that will come with maturity and some adjustments mechanically. PERSON runs very well, helping him be a threat on the basepaths and to cover a lot of ground in center, where it looks like he should be able to stay.The ORGANIZATION love the way PERSON competes and the energy he brings, reasons why they felt comfortable pushing him to the ORGANIZATION in his first real summer of pro ball and a reason why he could move more quickly than anticipated.",-1
"Ever since PERSON signed back in July 2015, when he was one of the better international prospects available in that signing class, he's shown off his outstanding speed and defensive acumen, with hints of what kind of offensive player he could become. His bat took a step forward in 2018, allowing him to reach Double-A and more than hold his own in the ORGANIZATION as a teenager. That carried over to a stellar 2019 season that included a trip to the ORGANIZATION Game.PERSON might be the best defensive outfielder in the ORGANIZATION at present and once he gets to the big leagues, he'll immediately join a list of elite-level center fielders. His speed allows him to cover a tremendous amount of ground and his plus instincts, reads and routes allow that to play up even more. He has a gun for an arm to go with it that would more than work in right, though there is zero question he's a ORGANIZATION caliber center fielder long-term. PERSON's straight running speed is close to top of the scale, but he's yet to translate it effectively in terms of stolen bases. PERSON's power is just starting to show up, at least in terms of extra-base ability, and he's showing signs of making adjustments to his swing that could eventually allow him to approach average power in the future. If he can continue to refine that swing and his approach, PERSON has the potential to be an All-Star caliber player. Even if he falls a little short of that, his ability to make contact, his speed and his outstanding defense point to a long Major League career.",-1
"MLBPipeline.com's No. 14 overall international prospect when the July 2015 signing period began, PERSON received $1.4 million to join the ORGANIZATION organization. He made his pro debut in the GPE the next summer and quickly played his way from the ORGANIZATION Coast to the LOCATION. A step behind PERSON, there's a fun ongoing debate within the organization over who will end up being the center fielder in PERSON down the road.The ORGANIZATION don't have to decide on that yet and can instead enjoy watching PERSON follow in GPE's footsteps. He has all the tools a team wants to see in center field. He has plus-plus speed and combines that with very good breaks and routes, especially given his age. His speed should help him on the basepaths as well. An aggressive hitter, PERSON makes consistent contact and rarely strikes out. GPE wins the power contest, but PERSON can hit the gaps with hard line drives.The PERSON vs. GPE debate might be on-going for the next couple of years, since PERSON is not particularly close to PERSON. Having this kind of up-the-middle talent should make other organizations envious, but there's nothing that says PERSON's future outfield can't hold both of these premium athletes.",-1
"Signed for $1.4 million back in July 2015, when he was ranked as the ORGANIZATION. 14 international prospect by ORGANIZATION, PERSON has improved rapidly since signing. He played across two levels of GPE ball during his professional debut in 2016, then showed it was far from a fluke by earning an All-Star nod as one of the youngest regulars in the full-season LOCATION League in 2017.PERSON is the best defender in the entire ORGANIZATION system, and might be the best defensive center fielder in the ORGANIZATION. He has plus speed to go along with outstanding instincts and supreme confidence in his ability to track down balls wherever they are hit. He also has a plus arm that allowed him to rack up 17 outfield assists in 2017. PERSON's speed also works on the basepaths and he'll become an even better basestealer as he learns his craft. Aggressive at the plate, PERSON has hit in the early stages of his career thanks to an ability to make consistent contact. While he has not hit a home run heading into the 2018 season, he has strength and raw power to tap into, with 12-15 homers as a potential ceiling. PERSON loses strength partially because he tends to start running before he finishes his swing. A tireless worker, the teenager has made strides to stay on his legs more, and showed some more ability to drive the ball during instructs, something that could help him become an All-Star-caliber player.",-1
"Signed for $50,000 out of the ORGANIZATION at the end of the 2013-14 international signing period, PERSON put up big numbers in his first three seasons in the GPE. He paced the Rookie-level PERSON with eight homers in 2016 and encored by hitting a combined .366/.394/.556 at three levels (including the Class A Advanced California League playoffs). He returned to the ORGANIZATION in 2018 and slumped during the first half before finishing on a .356/.382/.624 tear with 10 homers in the final six weeks to top the circuit in homers (24) and ORGANIZATION (109), then won playoff ORGANIZATION honors after leading PERSON to the championship.PERSON's electric bat speed and strength give him power to all fields, though there's some concern as to how it will translate at higher levels. He has settled his right-handed stroke down somewhat since turning pro, but he still has a hyper-aggressive approach and struggles against breaking pitches. He still overswings and chases balls out of the strike zone too often instead of just letting his natural pop take over.PERSON's arm strength is just as impressive as his raw power and he's capable of making any throw from any angle at third base. He has upgraded his range at the hot corner but needs to improve his throwing accuracy. If he slows down much as he fills out his 6-foot-2 frame, he could wind up at first base and saw extensive action there last year.",-1
"A GPE, PERSON joined the ORGANIZATION toward the end of the 2013-14 international signing period. He made his GPE debut in 2016, tying for the Rookie-level PERSON lead with eight home runs. He has continued to bash in 2017, beginning the summer in the Rookie-level PERSON and earning a promotion to low Class A after going 22-for-41 (.537) with five homers in 10 games.PERSON has a lot going on in his right-handed stroke, though his impressive bat speed has allowed him to feast on lower-level pitching. He'll have to quiet his approach and develop some plate discipline to tap into some of the best raw power in the system. Though he tends to swing at everything, he still manages to make a lot of hard contact.PERSON has some defensive value as well. He has seen action at third base, first base and second base this year, and projects to become at least an average defender at the hot corner. He has decent speed and quickness along with a strong arm, though his throwing accuracy needs to improve.",-1
"Signed for $50,000 out of the ORGANIZATION as the 2013-14 international signing period came to a close, PERSON led the Rookie-level PERSON with eight homers in his 2016 GPE debut. A shaky performance in instructional league that fall left the ORGANIZATION wondering if he could survive against better pitching, but he made adjustments and had a spectacular 2017. He batted .537 with five homers in 10 games at Rookie-level Ogden, hit .322 at ORGANIZATION A Great Lakes and then went 7-for-17 (.417) in the high ORGANIZATION A GPE League playoffs for a combined .366/.394/.556 line.PERSON has worked to calm down his right-handed stroke, allowing him to get more out of his electric bat speed. But he has met few pitches that he won't chase and overswings too often, traits that have proven to be his undoing in his return to the ORGANIZATION this year. He needs to develop an approach at the plate and realize that he has so much natural pop that he doesn't have to sell out for home runs. PERSON has an easy plus arm and the ability to make throws from any angle necessary at third base, though his accuracy needs to improve. His decent speed and quickness have led GPE to play him at all four infield spots, though he's better suited for the corners.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION has become a bit of a hot spot in terms of amateur talent, with prospects like PERSON, PERSON and PERSON all fetching large bonuses to start their pro careers. The ORGANIZATION hit the ORGANIZATION hard at the start of the 2017 international signing period, signing PERSON for $1.2 million and getting PERSON for $850,000. Both have begun their careers officially in 2018 in the Rookie-level PERSON League.PERSON stands out with his above-average athleticism and the chance to have multiple tools on the field. The right-handed hitter has plus speed which should help him on both sides of the ball. He could eventually be a plus defender in center field with at least an above-average arm. He has a nice swing and solid approach at the plate, utilizing a line-drive path. There is some raw power to tap into, but he's likely to be more of a gap-to-gap type in the future.Everything about PERSON is projection. All he needs now is a ton of reps against good competition so he can catch up to the speed of the game at the pro level. Once he gets that experience under his belt, his ceiling is quite high.",-1
"While the PERSON have been garnering a reputation of acquiring premium athletes in the early rounds of the GPE, they've also been busy bringing similar players via the international market. At the start of the 2017-18 international signing period, they double-dipped in the GPE, signing a pair of outfielders: Trent PERSON for $1.2 million and PERSON for $850,000. It's been PERSON who broke out of the gate during his pro debut in 2018, earning a promotion from the ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION League.Throughout his first summer of pro ball, PERSON showed a solid approach from both sides of the plate, with excellent bat speed. There's emerging power, though it only showed up from the left side during his debut. He's not afraid to draw walks and could be a plus hitter as he continues to refine his approach, perhaps eventually with average big league pop. PERSON has plus speed and loves to use it, though he'll have to learn the nuances of basestealing.The PERSON exposed the teenager to all three outfield spots, and he should have the range to play center field and enough arm to man right. Some of that might depend on how he continues to develop as he hopes to join prospects like PERSON of the D-backs and the ORGANIZATION' PERSON in putting GPE baseball more firmly on the map.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION gave GPE their second-highest bonus of the 2014-15 international signing period, giving the infielder $650,000 to sign in July 2014. Pushed aggressively to full-season ball in 2017, GPE struggled there and had to repeat the level a year ago. After a brutal April, GPE looked much more like the hitter the ORGANIZATION hoped they were signing, earning a promotion up to Clearwater in August.GPE hit .171 in April last year and spent much of the rest of 2018 digging his way out. The good news is he managed to do so, showing a hit tool that can be above-average and an ability to spray line drives to all fields from the left side of the plate. When he struggled, he got lungy at the plate and he needs to continue to work on being more patient and having more quality at-bats. He's never going to be a big power guy, but he is starting to add a little strength, which should allow him to have some extra-base authority.While perhaps just an average runner, GPE is an excellent athlete and has good baserunning instincts. His athleticism, range and hands all point to him being a very good defender at second base. If he can find some consistency with his offensive game, he has the chance to be a big league regular at the position.",-1
"Signed for $650,000 out of GPE in 2014, GPE had a successful GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2016, getting named to the ORGANIZATION post-season All-Star team and helping his Phillies team reach the rookie league's championship. He went 7-for-16 in the postseason (.438), ending the summer on a high note and leaving everyone excited for what might come. When GPE first joined the organization, he did so as a shortstop, splitting time between there and second during his 2015 professional debut in the ORGANIZATION. In 2016, GPE played the right side of the infield exclusively and has the chance to be an outstanding defensive second baseman. GPE has shown a maturity at the plate that belies his years. He works counts and draws walks, having done more of that than striking out in his two summers combined. He makes consistent hard contact and can spray line drives to all fields from the left side of the plate. He has some extra-base pop and could develop a little more power as he matures. He has average speed, one of the reasons his range might be lacking for shortstop, and he isn't a base-stealing threat. It was an encouraging first summer in the GPE for GPE. His advanced approach should help him as he moves up the ladder, and he has the chance to develop into a big league second baseman with outstanding contact and on-base skills.",-1
"Signed for $650,000 out of GPE as part of an exciting international class for the Phillies that included PERSON, GPE put himself on the prospect map with a strong GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2016, showing off plus hitting skills. He lost himself a bit with the jump to full-season ball in 2017, but the Phillies are still bullish on his upside.GPE came out of the gate in his full-season debut doing what he had done so well previously, barreling up the baseball consistently and using the whole field to his advantage. Then he lost his approach and tried to do too much in a big ballpark, worrying too much about trying to drive the ball out. That led to a lot of 390-foot outs instead of spraying line drives everywhere. GPE needs to add strength, something he did work on during the offseason, but really needs to focus on being a plus hitter, with whatever power comes as a result serving as a bonus.An average runner, GPE has the potential to be an outstanding defender at second base. As long as he can get back to the realistic gameplan that works for him , he can get back on the road to being a solid everyday middle infielder.",-1
"The Phillies have some very talented young pure hitters in their system. Behind PERSON and maybe PERSON, the team's last two first-round Draft picks, GPE might be the best bet to hit his way to the big leagues.In his first two summers since signing out of GPE for $650,000 in July 2014, GPE showed an advanced approach at the plate, drawing more walks than strikeouts over his first 400 career at-bats, as well as an outstanding feel for barreling up the ball. He wasn't able to keep that trend going with his first taste of full-season ball in 2017. While he is capable of driving the ball, it's still going to be a while before the teenager grows into his strength, which will make him a bigger threat with the bat. Initially a shortstop, GPE has moved over to second base and has the chance to be an excellent defender on the right side of the infield.The Phillies are willing to be patient with GPE, knowing he is just getting started. But if someone told the player development staff that PERSON looked like this when he was a teenager, they'd likely believe you. He has the chance to develop into the best pure hitting prospect in the system if he continues progressing as he has thus far.",-1
"GPE and raised in GPE, PERSON moved to GPE for his sophomore year of high school in 2016. He arrived with a mid-80s fastball and blossomed into the hardest thrower in the 2019 prep class, repeatedly reaching the upper 90s on the showcase circuit and breaking PERSON's Under PERSON All-America Game record with a 99-mph heater. The GPE selected him with the 24th overall pick in June and signed him for $2.5 million.PERSON operates at 94-97 mph and climbs into the triple digits with his fastball, overpowering hitters with his velocity and making them look bad with the riding action on his four-seamer and the heavy sink on his two-seamer. Opponents don't dare sit on his heater because he also possesses a pair of power breaking pitches in a sharp low-80s slider that's a little more devastating than an upper-70s curveball with depth. He didn't need his changeup much in high school and it gets too firm at times, though it also flashes good sink.No one questions PERSON's pure stuff, though some clubs projected him more as a reliever. He lacks consistent control and command, in part because he has a long arm action, but GPE plans on developing him as a starter. He's smaller than his listed height and weight and doesn't have much projection remaining, but that doesn't matter because he already has weapons to get big leaguers out.",-1
"As the ORGANIZATION work to rebuild their farm system, they likely will look back at the work they did early in the 2018 Draft as a big reason for the turnaround. Targeting college pitching, the quartet of PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON could form most of a big league rotation in a hurry. PERSON, the last of three first-round picks for PERSON, opened a lot of eyes during his pro debut and perhaps put himself on a faster track than anticipated, though some minor arm issues kept him off the mound for over a month during his first full season.While it's important to temper enthusiasm over one summer debut, it's hard not to get excited about how PERSON's stuff ticked up as a pro, especially considering he nearly reached 140 innings between his junior season at ORGANIZATION and his time in the ORGANIZATION. At times last summer, PERSON showed flashes of three plus pitches with plus command. He pitched at 94-95 mph consistently with his fastball, touching 97 mph, well up from his amateur velocity. He threw outstanding sliders and a very deceptive changeup while mixing in his average curve ball extremely well. His advanced feel for pitching and conviction of what he's doing on the mound made it all play up and he came in on right-handed hitters better than most young lefties.PERSON set the bar high for his first full season after his pro debut, but the ORGANIZATION are confident he can live up to his own expectations. He and the other college arms from the 2018 Draft class should feed off each other and could push each other up to PERSON in a hurry.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION spent all three of their 2018 first-round picks on college pitchers, selecting PERSON with the last of those choices at ORGANIZATION. 34 overall. Though he went just 12-12 with a 4.65 ERA in three seasons at GPE, he impressed scouts as a Cape Cod League All-Star last summer and as a junior this spring. After signing for $1,697,500, he showed improved velocity at the outset of his pro career.In college, PERSON relied heavily on his secondary pitches and worked with a two-seam fastball that sat around 90 mph and featured some sink. PERSON has had him focus more on his heater and using more four-seamers in his introduction to pro ball, and he has operated at 92-94 mph and touched 97. He also has added some more power to his breaking pitches, with his slider generally grading better than his curveball, and continued to display a deceptive changeup with sinking action.PERSON has made considerable strides in the last year with his control and command. He's not afraid to pitch inside and does an excellent job of controlling the running game. If he can maintain his newfound velocity, he could become a ORGANIZATION. 3 starter.",-1
"ORGANIZATION impressed scouts with a strong performance at the ORGANIZATION Championships as a 15-year-old in 2014 and signed for $2 million out of Venezuela the following year. The Rockies lack a complex-based affiliate, so they had him repeat the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION in 2017 rather than bring him to the GPE at age 18.Though he's still young and has a lot of development ahead of him, ORGANIZATION is one of the more projectable hitters in the system. He has a relatively advanced approach for a teenager, recognizing pitches, managing the strike zone and using the entire field. He has the potential to hit for a solid average while providing some gap power from the left side of the plate.Where ORGANIZATION winds up defensively is still in question. A solid runner with decent instincts, he spent almost all of his pro debut in center field but has played mostly right field in 2017. He could lose a step as he matures physically and presently has fringy arm strength, so he may be destined for left field.",-1
"After playing well for the ORGANIZATION team at the ORGANIZATION Championships as a 15-year-old in 2014, PERSON signed the next year for $2 million. Because the Rockies lack a complex-based affiliate, they had him spend the first two years of his pro career in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION. He made some nice adjustments during his second tour and will come to the GPE in 2018.PERSON employed an aggressive approach in his pro debut but displayed a more controlled left-handed swing in his second tour of the ORGANIZATION. He's an advanced hitter for a teenager with the ability to recognize pitches and manage the strike zone. He uses the entire field and projects to hit for average with some gap power.PERSON spent most of his debut in center field before seeing most of his action in right field last year. He's a solid runner with decent instincts but could slow down a step as he gets stronger. Because he has fringy arm strength, he ultimately could wind up in left field.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION handed out nine bonuses of at least six figures in the 2015-16 international signing period, none greater than the $2 million given to PERSON to sign out of GPE. After two-plus summers playing in the ORGANIZATION, the outfielder made a solid GPE debut in the rookie-level PERSON in 2018.PERSON has always had tools and he's starting to grow into them. One of the biggest steps forward has been his ability to add man strength, with emotional maturity to match. He's an advanced hitter with an excellent left-handed swing, one who is getting more patient and using all fields better each year. He stuck to his gameplan well in 2018, handling offspeed stuff more consistently well and using the middle of the field better. As he continues to get stronger, the ORGANIZATION think he could have average power. He played a solid center field in GPE Junction a year ago and has a chance to stay there, though he's also seen time in right, with an arm that now plays average.While he's just getting started stateside, the ORGANIZATION feel PERSON might be turning a corner physically and mentally. There's an up arrow next to his name, with a chance he could make a big step forward.",-1
"International scouts loved PERSON's 6-foot-1, 178-pound frame and the ORGANIZATION loved his upside enough to give him $2 million to sign when the July 2 signing period began.PERSON is lean -- some evaluators even describe him as lanky -- and he is athletic, with room to grow. On defense, some scouts view him as the ideal center fielder because of his ability to read balls off the bat and his defensive instincts. He has also impressed evaluators with his reactions to balls hit into the gaps. A natural left-handed hitter with a fluid stroke and a good approach, he should grow into more power.PERSON's arm is best described as playable, and he has enough arm strength to play his primary position in center field. He does have some experience playing in the infield, particularly at second base, but his future will be in the outfield as long as he continues to develop.",-1
"The tragic death of catcher PERSON left PERSON as the jewel of GPE's 2017-18 international signing class. No longer hampered by two years of spending restrictions after exceeding their bonus pool in 2014-15, the ORGANIZATION signed him for $1.6 million out of GPE. Much like PERSON in 2013, he stood out as having perhaps the best combination of hitting ability and power on the international market.For now, PERSON's pop ranks ahead of his bat. He's strong for a 17-year-old, has a very quick right-handed stroke and showed easy power in his 2018 pro debut before breaking the hamate bone in his left hand in July. Though his swing can get too uphill when he gets home run-happy, he generally shows a good approach and a willingness to use the entire field.A shortstop as an amateur, PERSON moved to third base as soon as he turned pro. He presently has average speed, but figures to slow down as he continues to mature physically and doesn't figure to retain the quickness to stay at short. His strong arm and offensive upside profile well at third base, and he has the makeup and work ethic to get the most out of his tools.",-1
"No longer hampered by international spending restrictions after exceeding their bonus pool in 2014-15, the ORGANIZATION gave seven-figure bonuses to three Venezuelans this summer. PERSON, who has more offensive potential than fellow bonus babies PERSON and PERSON, received $1.6 million.Like PERSON did when PERSON signed him in 2013, PERSON had arguably the best combination of hitting ability and power in his international class. A right-handed hitter, he's strong and has very quick hands. While there are times when he sells out too much for power and his swing gets steep, he generally employs a sound approach and shows a willingness to use the entire field.Though he's an average runner now, PERSON figures to lose a step as he continues to fill out and probably won't have the quickness to stay at shortstop. His strong arm and offensive profile should make him a good fit at third base, however. PERSON praise his makeup and work ethic as well as his physical tools.",-1
"After two years of spending restrictions for exceeding their international pool in 2014, the ORGANIZATION came out of the penalty box in 2017 and gave seven-figure bonuses to three GPE position players, including $1.6 million for PERSON. As was the case with PERSON in 2013, there were scouts who believed PERSON had the best combination of hitting ability and power in his international class. His pop was more evident in his 2018 pro debut, when he slugged six homers in 26 games in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION before breaking the hamate bone in his left hand.PERSON has exciting bat speed and plenty of strength -- he's much bigger than his listed 6-foot-1 and 170 pounds after growing and adding considerable weight in his first year as a pro -- and has some of the best raw power in the system. He's still learning that home runs will come naturally, however. He got overly aggressive in his debut, losing control of the strike zone and getting too uphill with his right-handed swing at times.A shortstop with average speed as an amateur, PERSON instantly moved to third base in pro ball and has slowed down as he has gotten bigger. There are mixed reports about his defense at the hot corner and his ability to stay there, but he definitely has the required arm strength and his work ethic should help. If he gets the most out of his power potential, his bat should profile almost anywhere.",-1
"In each of the past five Drafts, there has been a high school hitter from GPE taken in the top two rounds, two of whom were first-rounders, in brothers PERSON and PERSON. PERSON, the best GPE prospect in the 2019 class, didn't go quite as high, earning a third-round selection by ORGANIZATION after an amateur career that included winning a bronze medal as a member of ORGANIZATION at the ORGANIZATION 18-and-under ORGANIZATION Championships in GPE last fall. The ORGANIZATION A&M commit signed for $800,000, above his slot's value of $678,600. Most evaluations on PERSON are projections for far off in the future, and the ORGANIZATION know they will have to be patient with his development. He does have solid contact skills from the right side of the plate and should grow into some raw power. He needs to add strength and has trouble impacting the ball at times as a result, though some scouts point out that PERSON was most heavily scouted while facing pro competition this spring. He has close to top-of-the-scale speed, which makes him a threat on the basepaths and helps him cover a ton of ground in center field, where he should be a plus defender down the road.As a younger player with premium athleticism and a ton of ceiling, PERSON may require more time to develop than the typical prep pick. But while it may take some time, the long-term payoff could be huge.",-1
"The best catcher on the 2016-17 international market, PERSON signed for a relative bargain at $800,000. A former shortstop, he added 25 pounds in the year before he turned pro. He has a similar build and offensive profile to fellow PERSON, another infielder-turned-backstop whom the ORGANIZATION sent to the ORGANIZATION in a 2015 trade for PERSON, though PERSON has a higher defensive ceiling.More athletic than most catchers, PERSON has quick feet, soft hands and improving arm strength. He projects to become at least solid at receiving and throwing as he develops physically. He's agile and has advanced instincts for someone who moved behind the plate in 2015.A switch-hitter with a short stroke, PERSON uses a contact approach and focuses on hitting line drives from gap to gap. While he has room on his 5-foot-11 frame to continue adding strength, he's unlikely to grow into more than gap power. He has fringy speed, which makes him a better runner than most catchers.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION got the best catcher -- and one of the best bargains -- in the 2016-17 international market when they landed PERSON for $800,000. A former shortstop who added 25 pounds in the year before he turned pro, he comes out of the same Venezuelan program from which PERSON signed PERSON. PERSON athletic for a catcher, PERSON has soft hands, quick feet and improving arm strength. The ORGANIZATION believe he'll become solid or better at both throwing and receiving once he matures physically. He's agile behind the plate and shows good instincts despite not playing there before 2015.A switch-hitter, PERSON employs a short stroke from both sides of the plate and focuses on making line-drive contact. That's a sensible gameplan because while he can add more strength, he won't ever be very physical or have a lot of power. He should still have fringy speed -- which is good for a catcher -- once he fills out.",-1
"Undrafted and lightly recruited in 2016 out of ORGANIZATION (PERSON, GPE), where he played with 2017 No. 1 overall pick PERSON and 2019 Cubs second-rounder Chase Strumpf, PERSON blossomed into one of the better hitters in college baseball and a supplemental first-rounder after three years at PERSON. The 2019 Big 12 Conference co-player of the year, he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $1.6 million as the 41st overall choice. PERSON used its first selection in June on another third baseman who shared the award with him, PERSON's PERSON Jung.PERSON shows no fear at the plate, working deep counts while waiting for a pitch to drive and accepting walks if pitchers won't challenge him. He stays inside the ball well with his right-handed swing and uses the entire field. He tends to drive the ball from gap to gap and could make more of his solid strength and raw power if he turns on more pitches.PERSON had well below-average speed when he got to college but worked hard to transform himself into a close to average runner out of the batter's box, and he plays quicker than that with fine instincts on the bases. He shows some twitchy athleticism at third base, where both his arm his defense earn solid to plus grades. He played almost everywhere on the diamond for PERSON during games and fall practice, and some scouts were intrigued by the idea of making him a catcher.",-1
"As a high school sophomore, PERSON emerged as a candidate to go No. 1 overall in the 2015 Draft. In the next two years, scouts cooled a bit on the son of former All-Star and ORGANIZATION, but he still landed a $4 million bonus as a supplemental first-round pick. He looked overmatched in low Class A in 2016 and for the first two months of 2017 before starting to get going at the plate in June. He was putting the finishing touches on a huge second half when he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION Verlander trade.With his compact right-handed stroke and line-drive approach, PERSON has the upside of a solid hitter with perhaps average power once he gets stronger and pulls more pitches. Smoothing out his swing and making mechanical changes to put him in a better position to hit allowed him to start realizing his potential. For what it's worth, his father didn't do much in his first four pro seasons and wound up playing 17 years in the big leagues.PERSON has a chance to contribute in all phases of the game, standing out the most with his defensive ability in center field. He has good speed, outstanding defensive instincts and an average arm that should allow him to play all three outfield spots.

He's not a burner, but likes to run and can steal a base, though he'll have to learn to be more efficient in the future. That speed to go along with plus defensive instincts will allow him to stay in center for the long haul.The Tigers barely got to see PERSON following the trade, though he impressed with his work ethic and attitude at instructs.

Signed for $200,000, he's tiny but has a quick arm and generates some of the best spin rates in a ORGANIZATION organization that puts a premium on them. He spent his first two pro seasons in three different Rookie leagues, logging a 2.99 ERA with 146 strikeouts in 108 1/3 innings. PERSON generates tremendous spin on both his fastball and curveball. His curve has good depth, already generates plus grades on a regular basis and serves as his best pitch. He works in the low 90s and has hit 96 mph with his heater, which features riding life.PERSON also throws a fading changeup that should develop into an average third offering. He slashed his walk rate from 6.0 per nine innings in his debut to 2.9 last year, so his biggest need to remain a starter is to add strength to his small frame. If he's not durable enough for the rotation, his fastball/curveball combination could make him a dynamic reliever.",-1
"â¢ 7/16: PERSON promoted to Triple-AAfter spending $18.1 million on the 2014 international market, the ORGANIZATION were restricted to giving out bonuses of no more than $300,000 the following summer, yet they still landed a pair of quality pitching prospects in GPE right-handers PERSON ($200,000) and PERSON ($280,000). While GPE has louder stuff, PERSON has much more polish and used it to rush from low Class A to Double-A in only three months at age 19 last year. He struck out 12 in seven perfect innings in the second game of a Class A Advanced doubleheader on Aug. 6, though his GPE team lost the game (but not the no-hitter) in the eighth. PERSON's best pitch is a high-spin curveball with so much depth that he'll have to prove he can land it for strikes when more advanced hitters don't chase it out of the zone as often. He also gets good spin on his fastball, which plays better than its 91-96 mph velocity with deceptive riding life. He made strides with his fading changeup in 2018, creating optimism that it can become at least a solid third offering.Though he doesn't have the smoothest delivery, PERSON repeats it well and exhibits advanced control and command for such a young pitcher. Because he's small and works with some effort, there are some concerns about his long-term durability as a starter, but his athleticism and efficiency help his cause. His fastball/curveball combination should play well in the late innings if he winds up as a reliever.",-1
"PERSON's road to pro ball was tumultuous, to say the least. Leading up to the 2016 Draft, the GPE shortstop's name was popping up at the top of the first round. But news of a positive test for a performance-enhancing drug forced his stock to fall. The ORGANIZATION nabbed him with the first of their three first-rounders, giving him full pick value to sign.During his pro debut, PERSON showed all of the raw tools that had amateur scouts excited about his upside, all while dealing with the pre-Draft adversity with impressive maturity, though he didn't replicate that performance at the plate in 2017. For now, his defense is ahead of his bat, with no questions about his ability to stay at short long-term. He uses his outstanding speed well to cover a ton of ground and he has excellent hands and a strong arm to boot. He tends to try to do too much at times, something that he will harness as he gets more time under his belt. At the plate, he showed an ability to make hard contact at times, though he'll have to refine his approach and learn to recognize soft stuff better. He should grow into more power as he matures and his speed makes him a base-stealing threat.As time passes, PERSON should be able to put his pre-Draft mistake more and more firmly in the rear-view mirror and show who he truly is. It could very well be that misstep allowed the ORGANIZATION to acquire an elite-level player at a premium position.",-1
"Not a whole lot has gone right for PERSON in the last couple of years. Thought to be a potential top 10 pick in the 2016 GPE, he slid after a positive test for a performance-enhancer. The ORGANIZATION took a chance and drafted him closer to the end of that first round, but while he did show some tools during his pro debut that summer, he struggled in 2017 and his summer ended with a broken hand in early August.That's the bad news. The good news is the shortstop had a productive offseason once his hand healed. That included playing for PERSON, and manager PERSON, in the ORGANIZATION U-23 Baseball Championship to earn a spot in next fall's World Cup. In addition to getting him more playing time, the ORGANIZATION wanted to make sure he worked on getting more physical. PERSON has solid bat-to-ball skills and drew some walks, even when struggling, but a serious lack of strength kept him from impacting the baseball. Some evaluators worry he won't be able to add the strength necessary to hit, but the ORGANIZATION see strength in his hands and forearms and think his build will allow him to add good weight.There's no question about PERSON's defense. He has plus speed and outstanding range as a result, to go along with above-average hands and a plus arm when he needs to. Still just 19, there's time yet, but he will have to start showing more at the plate to come close to reaching the potential of a big league regular people saw leading into the GPE.",-1

He has good speed, instincts, range and hands, as well as a plus arm. Able to make the flashy play, perhaps his only flaw defensively is that he can try to do too much on occasion. PERSON's bat is behind his glove, but there are tools to work with. He can ambush a fastball early in the count, but his approach at the plate and pitch recognition need to be refined. PERSON's speed works offensively, and he could grow into more power as he matures.It's not easy to find premium middle infielders, a big reason why the ORGANIZATION were willing to take a chance, even given the positive drug test.

With his strength, bat speed and leverage, he can hit the ball farther than most high school players. Relatively new to baseball, PERSON lacks polish at times at the plate, on the bases and in the field.

"One of the best all-around athletes to come out of GPE in years, PERSON entered the spring of 2015 as a potential first-round pick. The Nigerian-born outfielder, who had moved to GPE when he was 10 months old, had an uneven spring, and the ORGANIZATION were thrilled to see his name still on the board in the the fourth round. After he signed for $450,000, PERSON impressed evaluators during his pro debut in the Rookie-level PERSON, where he hit .292 with an .838 ORGANIZATION, six home runs and 19 steals in just 33 games.At 6-foot-4 and 225 pounds, PERSON is a physical specimen with three legit plus tools in his raw power, speed, arm strength. With his strength, bat speed and leverage, he can hit the ball farther than most prep draftees, and he showed surprising feel for the barrel in his pro debut. He's still very raw defensively, but he has all the prototypical right-field tools.Because he's relatively new to baseball, it's not surprising that PERSON lacks polish at times at the plate, on the bases and in the field. He may require some extra time to refine those skills in the ORGANIZATION, but it's easy to dream on him becoming an impact bat in right field.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION spent lavishly during the 2014-15 international signing period, handing a $72.5 million contract to GPE, giving a record $31.5 million bonus (and paying a matching tax penalty to ORGANIZATION) to PERSON and locking up the top amateur pitcher with a $1.8 million bonus for PERSON. After PERSON signed with little fanfare out of the ORGANIZATION in July 2014, he led the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION in K/BB ratio (21.0) and walk rate (0.4 per nine innings) in his 2015 debut and has pounded the strike zone ever since. He topped the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in wins (nine), ORGANIZATION (1.45), ORGANIZATION (0.95) and walk rate (1.0) last summer and has dominated in similar fashion in Class A this year.PERSON doesn't have a pitch that grades better than average but has been effective against lower-level hitters because he can locate four offerings wherever he wants and sequences them well. His fastball usually ranges from 88-92 mph with decent life, and he uses his 6-foot-4 frame and high arm slot to create steep downhill plane. His changeup is his most consistent secondary pitch, while his harder slider is more effective than his curveball, which has some downer action but lacks power.PERSON has precocious feel for pitching but doesn't have a lot of projection remaining, so he may not throw much harder. He has little margin for error and is vulnerable on the rare occasions he leaves pitches up in the strike zone. No GPE pitching prospect can match his performance since he has turned pro, though his ceiling may be no more than that of a No. 5 starter.",-1
"GPE spent more than $146 million on its 2014 international class, including a $72.5 million contract for ORGANIZATION and a record $31.5 million bonus (plus a matching amount in penalty tax) for PERSON. Signed with no fanfare for $90,000 out of the ORGANIZATION Republic that July, PERSON has pounded the strike zone and dominated everywhere he has gone since. The low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION named him its pitcher of the year in 2018, when he ranked second in the Minors in GPE (0.91), fourth in GPE (1.97) and K/BB ratio (7.6) and fifth in walk rate (1.1 per nine innings).PERSON derives his success from uncanny command, a knack for sequencing his pitches and deception. His fastball works from 88-92 mph with ordinary life, but plays better than its velocity because he uses his 6-foot-4 frame and high arm slot to create extension and downhill plane. His changeup is his most reliable secondary offering and his low-80s slider/cutter is more effective than his mid-70s curveball, which has shape but lacks power.PERSON has supreme pitchability but his body is fairly maxed out, so he probably won't throw much harder. He has little margin for error but rarely made mistakes while averaging 0.9 walks per nine innings during his first four pro seasons. While it's hard to give him a ceiling higher than a No. 5 starter, he's intelligent, determined and gets the most out of his ability.",-1
"Back in 2015, PERSON was ranked No. 27 on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list as a potential future shortstop, with strong enough reports to warrant a $2 million bonus from the PERSON to sign that July. A strong pro debut in the ORGANIZATION pushed him to the GPE League that summer, but he's struggled to find his offensive footing since.The PERSON sent PERSON to full-season Rome to start 2017, and it was a mistake. The teenage switch-hitter was in over his head in the LOCATION League and got sent back down to the ORGANIZATION to try to hit the reset button. He still has solid tools and excellent athleticism, with his plus speed his true carrying tool. At his best, he's shown the ability to make consistent contact and spray line drives all over the field, more consistently from the right side than the left. While he was a shortstop initially, he moved over to second when he went back down to Danville a year ago and that's now his likely full-time home, where he should be a capable defender without his fringy arm causing issues.It's hard to put pressure on a 19-year-old by saying that it's a big year for him, but the 2018 season could be a huge one for PERSON. He has plenty of time to develop into a speedy everyday second baseman, but he needs to start showing what he can do.",-1

He hit so well during his Gulf Coast League debut that he earned a promotion up to the GPE League at age 17.PERSON didn't continue swinging a hot bat once he got to GPE, but the ORGANIZATION were impressed with how the teenager maturely dealt with adversity. He's still learning how to switch-hit; he's much better from his natural right side, and while his left-handed swing is workable, there is a chance he'll eventually stick to that side only. He does make consistent hard contact with some extra-base gap power, and he could grow into some more, though it's not likely to be a huge part of his game. His hitting will continue to improve as he refines his approach. He's a plus runner who will be a basestealing threat. His defense at short has improved tremendously, especially after working tirelessly with PERSON. The only thing in question about him staying there is his fringe-average arm, though physical maturity and confidence will aid that particular tool.PERSON is starting to grow into some man strength, which will only help him in all facets of his game.

The switch-hitting infielder is a stronger hitter from the right side, where he can make consistent contact with a line-drive swing. It's gap power right now, but he might grow into a little more in the future, especially as he refines his approach. His best offensive tool is his speed, and it's plus, which should allow him to be a basestealing threat. It also helps him cover a lot of ground in the infield, with his range and feet giving him a chance to stay at short. His arm might not. He has fringy arm strength and struggles with his mechanics at times, with some thinking he might end up at second or in center field. For now, he'll continue to get work at shortstop, where he'll continue trying to live up to the comps to Jose PERSON that were dropped on him when he was an amateur.",-1

He could hit plenty of home runs by letting them come naturally, but he sells out for power so much that there are some concerns about how well he'll be able to handle pro pitching. PERSON has infield actions, soft hands and a strong arm, he's unlikely to remain at shortstop. He's a fringy runner who figures to lose a step as he fills out, making him better suited for third base. If he delivers on his power potential, he'll provide enough offense to profile at any position.",-1
"ORGANIZATION's top-rated prospect in the 2014-15 international crop, PERSON got the largest payout ($3 million) in a ORGANIZATION spending binge that exceeded $17 million in bonuses. Though power is his carrying tool, he didn't homer in his '15 pro debut before bouncing back with 30 homers in 120 games over the next two seasons. PERSON also struck out in 32 percent of his plate appearances, making him the biggest boom-or-bust prospect in the system.PERSON's outstanding bat speed and strength give him top-of-the-scale raw power, though it remains to be seen how much he'll be able to tap into it against more advanced pitching. He still has trouble with recognizing pitches and handling offspeed offerings, and he has yet to prove he can make consistent contact. PERSON has displayed a willingness to accept walks, though he still chases pitches out of the strike zone with alarming frequency.PERSON has plenty of arm strength for third base, but he's a well-below-average runner with limited range and a history of errors at the hot corner. He has seen most of his action at first base in 2018, but he may never be more than an adequate defender there.

He's as raw as he is powerful, however, as he has a long way to go with recognizing pitches, handling offspeed offerings and making consistent contact. He topped the ORGANIZATION with 79 strikeouts and a 34 percent whiff rate while also ranking second-to-last with a .206 batting average.A classic boom-or-bust type, PERSON will have to deliver on his prodigious power potential to have a big league career. He has a strong arm but is a well below-average runner with limited range and has provided erratic defense at third base.

"PERSON had hamstring issues during his senior year of high school in GPE, forcing him to miss the season, which led to him being available in the second round at pick No. 53, the ORGANIZATION' first selection in the 2015 Draft. The problems persisted that summer and into 2016, limiting the talented outfielder to just 236 at-bats over two summers. In 2017 he avoided leg injuries, but an elbow problem ended his season in July with ulnar nerve surgery and he spent time on the disabled list again in 2018.The good news is that despite all the missed time, PERSON still shows solid tools at the plate. Trouble seeing the ball led to a rough start during his first taste of full-season ball in 2017, but after that was addressed with a new prescription, he started to hit for average and power before his season ended, though that didn't carry over to the following season. He can drive the ball to all fields and will draw walks, albeit with a fairly high strikeout rate, though that improved with the sight adjustment. He still runs well, despite the leg issues, and while he was hesitant because of the injuries, he might get the green light more moving forward on the basepaths and it allows him to cover a lot of ground and play a solid center field. His arm is fine for center, but he'd likely have to move to left should he slow down.The first order of business is for PERSON to get a full season of reps in on both sides of the ball so he can continue refining his approach at the plate as well as his reads and routes in the outfield. If he can do that, then it might be easier to project his upside.",-1
"Hamstring issues have likely kept PERSON from being more known on the prospect landscape. Then again, the fact that he missed his senior year of high school with a hamstring injury is likely the only reason he was around for the ORGANIZATION to take him in the second round, a silver lining in that cloud.When PERSON is on the field, he might be one of the highest-upside players in the ORGANIZATION system. A tremendous athlete, the GPE prep product has the potential to eventually be a plus hitter with plus power. He can drive the ball the other way and will have over-the-fence power in the future. He has been working on refining his approach, though his strikeout rate was high in his first taste of full-season ball in 2017. He has plus speed, but his hamstring issues -- he not only missed his last amateur year, he lost some time in 2016 as well -- have been a concern and kept him from completely letting loose. An infielder in high school, Linday's still adjusting to life in center field, where the ORGANIZATION feel he'll eventually develop into an above-average defender. PERSON needs to stay healthy and get reps on both sides of the ball to progress and potentially move into a more impact-level prospect territory. He missed three weeks in 2017 but far surpassed his previous highs in games played and at-bats.",-1
"While a hamstring injury limited PERSON to just seven games during his senior season in the GPE high school ranks, the ORGANIZATION clearly saw enough of him over the summer and fall to feel comfortable making him their first selection of the 2015 Draft, the ORGANIZATION. 59 overall pick in the second round.With five-tool potential, there's a lot to like from PERSON when he's healthy. He can make consistent hard contact at the plate, with good bat speed which leads to the ability to drive the gaps now and with more power to come. PERSON and athletic, PERSON runs very well, which should serve him well on both sides of the ball. Mostly an infielder in high school, PERSON has the tools to handle the outfield, with some thinking he has the chance to play center field regularly.Especially since he missed so much time with the injury - his pro debut was delayed as well - it might some time for PERSON to get going. But the end result could be a very exciting player to watch.",-1
"Hamstring issues wiped out PERSON's senior year of high school in GPE, but the ORGANIZATION liked his tools and projection enough that they took him with their first overall pick (ORGANIZATION. 53 overall) in the 2015 Draft. PERSON's hamstring problems persisted that summer and into 2016, limiting the talented outfielder to 236 at-bats over two summers. When his legs were finally healthy in 2017, an elbow injury ended PERSON's season in July and required ulnar nerve transposition surgery. A flare-up in his elbow in '18 led to another trip to the ORGANIZATION, but he came back strong and impressed in the ORGANIZATION, showing some newfound power as part of his across-the-board tools. In the ORGANIZATION, PERSON consistently achieved a better point of contact with his swing, with bat speed and extension that allowed him to tap into his plus raw power. After homering three times in 360 plate appearances during the regular season, PERSON needed only 31 PAs to match that total in the ORGANIZATION. That ability to consistently impact the ball has been absent for much of PERSON's career, and the hope is that it will unlock his potential as someone who hits for both average and power. He can drive the ball to all fields and will draw walks, albeit with some swing-and-miss tendencies. PERSON still runs well, despite the leg issues, and while he's largely been hesitant on the basepaths because of the injuries, he should get the green light more moving forward provided he stays healthy. His plus speed allows him to cover a lot of ground and play a solid center field, where his average arm strength is a fit. Evaluators who have seen PERSON at his best are quick to note that his production as a pro does not reflect his tools and potential. If he can avoid the disabled list, PERSON could develop into a second-division regular in center field.",-1
"Because PERSON missed most of his senior season of high school with a hamstring injury, he was a bit difficult to evaluate before the 2015 ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION saw him play really well the summer before, including at their own ORGANIZATION, making them confident enough to nab him in the second round, their first selection in the ORGANIZATION due to the ORGANIZATION signing.Once PERSON got on the field, he didn't disappoint, earning a promotion from the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League up to Class A Short-Season Brooklyn. The GPE prepster showed a good approach at the plate, with good bat speed and a willingness to work counts. He has some natural strength, and while his power is mostly gap-to-gap right now, there should be more to come. PERSON has excellent speed, which should allow him to be a dynamic player on both sides of the ball. A corner infielder in high school, he's making the switch to center field in pro ball. He has the tools to eventually be an average defender there.With athleticism to spare, PERSON has plenty of raw tools to work with. It may take him a while, but he has the potential to be an everyday center fielder at the big league level.",-1
"PERSON was a two-year starter at ORGANIZATION, where most scouts viewed him as a good college player who lacked an above-average tool and didn't fit the profile at second base. The ORGANIZATION took him in the fifth round of the 2018 Draft because they thought he had some upside if he could make some adjustments, though he hit just .240/.348/.332 in his pro debut. He has taken off in 2019, however, emerging as one of the most dangerous hitters in the Class A Advanced California League.In college, PERSON focused on making contact and getting on base. He since has added some muscle and GPE has gotten him to be more aggressive, use his legs more and add some loft to his right-handed swing. Now he's getting the most out of his strong 6-foot-3 frame and displaying at least average power to all fields.PERSON still has fringy speed but he has transformed himself on defense at well. After previously showing a subpar arm and range at second base, he has quickened his footwork and improved his arm strength. He now looks like a reliable second baseman and has proven himself capable of handling third base.",-1
"ORGANIZATION's top-rated prospect on the international amateur market for 2018-19, PERSON signed for $2.5 million out of GPE in July. His addition bolstered an already strong collection of ORGANIZATION catching prospects that ranks as the best in baseball. He won't make his pro debut until 2019 but is advanced enough to come to the GPE at age 17 when he does.PERSON draws repeated PERSON comparisons because of his large frame, defensive ability and strong makeup. He moves well for a tall guy behind the plate and demonstrates advanced receiving skills for his age. He has the arm strength and accuracy to keep the running game in check.One way in which he differs from GPE is that PERSON's hitting stands out more than his power. He understands the strike zone and recognizes pitches better than most teenagers, and he shows a willingness to use the opposite field. He has mostly gap power at present but could develop into a 15-homer threat as he gets stronger and turns on more pitches.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION have more catching depth than any farm system, and they added to it last July when they landed ORGANIZATION's top-rated international amateur in the 2018 class. They signed PERSON for $2.5 million out of GPE, banking on his potential to contribute on both sides of the ball coupled with strong makeup. He draws repeated PERSON comparisons and like the perennial All-Star and ORGANIZATION, PERSON was advanced enough to make his GPE debut at 17.Though he's taller than most catchers, PERSON is agile and moves well behind the plate. He already shows advanced receiving ability for a teenager and should fit in well in an organization that prioritizes framing skills. He also has a strong arm and makes accurate throws.PERSON's feel for barrel and the strike zone stands out for such a young player. He recognizes pitches well and is willing to use the opposite field, emphasizing making hard contact over selling out for power. As he learns to turn on pitches and use his lower half more in his right-handed swing, he could produce 15 or more homers per year.",-1

Making his full-season debut in the Class A GPE ORGANIZATION in 2018, PERSON scuffled initially but dominated during the second half, posting a 0.84 ERA with 64 strikeouts and a .171 ORGANIZATION over his final 53 2/3 frames (11 appearances).PERSON already pitches with a plus fastball, sitting at 92-94 mph and reaching 96, with late life that makes the pitch difficult to barrel. His curveball is above average but can flash plus, thrown with a high spin rate that gives it late bite, and the same can be said about the fading changeup he's made strides in developing. Meanwhile, that he does a good job repeating his simple delivery and knows how to find his release point with each pitch suggests he could develop above-average command.The PERSON kept PERSON on a tight leash during his first full season and never allowed him to throw more than 90 pitches in a start. While the training wheels should come off a bit more going forward, it wouldn't be surprising if the club employed a similar approach to managing PERSON's workload in 2019. That could lead to a slower climb through the Minors for the young lefty, who has the upside of a mid-rotation starter at the highest level.",-1

While he was gone, he helped PERSON win the 2016 state 5-A title and established himself as one of the top left-handed pitchers in the 2017 Draft. PERSON only confirmed that assessment this spring with an impressive senior campaign, and he became the fourth southpaw selected in the Draft after the ORGANIZATION took him with the ORGANIZATION. 21 overall pick in the first round. He signed for above slot at $3 million, forgoing a commitment to PERSON State.PERSON usually operates at 90-93 mph and can touch 95 with his heater, which has some running action but is more notable for his command than his life. His hard curve is often his best offering and features a high spin rate, though it can get slurvy at times. While his changeup is still in its nascent stages, it's showing improvement as he commits to throwing it more often.PERSON draws comparisons to PERSON for his build and live arm. He has a sound delivery, though his arm slot can wander and detract from his control and command. And while he isn't very big or physical, PERSON still has some room to add strength.",-1

PERSON's arm slot can be inconsistent at times, thus limiting his command, though he did make strides in cleaning up his delivery during the club's fall instructional league.PERSON draws comparisons to PERSON for his build, live arm and overall upside.

While that process is still in its relative early stages, the early signs of progress have certainly been encouraging.PERSON projects as a future starter with a solid three-pitch mix. While his fastball is just average now, there is more in the tank, with the chance for it to be a future plus pitch. PERSON has had success throwing it with good sink to get ground-ball outs. He complements his heavy fastball with a solid curveball and changeup, and he has shown the ability to throw strikes with all three offerings. PERSON is athletic and repeats his delivery well.There's still a long way to go for PERSON, who has yet to hit full-season ball. But the 19-year-old has a ton of projection and appears headed in the right direction, with a potential future as a middle or back-end of the rotation type starter.",-1
"PERSON considered PERSON one of the top defensive outfielders in the 2016 prep class, but his lack of profile tools and commitment to PERSON left him undrafted. A three-year starter in center for the ORGANIZATION, he was their best hitter at the 2018 College World Series, where they lost to PERSON in the finals. As with his older brother PERSON, an infielder with the ORGANIZATION, his skills still stand out more than his pure physical ability. The D-backs took PERSON with the last of their seven picks on Day 1 of the 2019 Draft and assigned him straight to Class A Kane County for his pro debut.PERSON's best attribute is his play in center field. Though he's a fringy runner out of the batter's box, he's quicker once he gets going and has tremendous instincts that allow him to track down balls from gap to gap. He has displayed plus arm strength in the past, though it has played closer to average in 2019.PERSON has a power-based approach at the plate, and his strength and aggressive, pull-conscious mentality could produce 15-20 homers per season. He doesn't have the smoothest left-handed swing and he's a streaky hitter, but he makes consistent contact and should hit for a decent average. He has shown improved discipline at the plate this spring, though his offensive package may fit better for a fourth outfielder than an everyday player.",-1
"A prototypical projectable high school right-hander, PERSON's stock initially rose with a big PERSON Games performance in the summer of 2017. An uneven senior season after that hurt, though he was pitching well as the ORGANIZATION approached. The ORGANIZATION nabbed him in the ninth round and went way over pick value to sign him away from his GPE commitment for $800,000 and sent him out for his debut in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON has the chance to have three average or better pitches when all is said and done. Tall and lean, the right-hander has a live and loose arm that currently throws a fastball anywhere in the 88-94 mph range. There's plenty of room for him to add strength to his 6-foot-4 frame, so dreaming on more consistent velocity is easy. He mostly threw his slider during his pro debut, and it shows flashes of a plus pitch, and the hope is he'll be able to mix in an average and distinct curveball, as well. He shows some feel for his changeup, but that is also a work in progress.With a free and easy delivery, PERSON should be able to be a consistent strike-thrower as he gets more reps. It will take patience because he is so far away, but the chance to have a solid starting pitcher profile could be worth the wait.",-1
"GPE put himself firmly on the prospect map for the 2018 ORGANIZATION when he matched top prospect PERSON Hankins from GPE velocity-wise at the ORGANIZATION Games last summer. His star faded a bit when he broke out of the gate poorly this spring, though he was climbing a bit as the ORGANIZATION approached. When he wasn't drafted in the first couple of rounds, it seemed like he might be headed to GPE for college ball, but the ORGANIZATION gave him a well above-pick-value bonus of $800,000 to sign in the ninth round.GPE will be a bit of a project, but there's a lot to work with. He's tall, athletic and projectable with a ton of upside. His quick arm and long frame helped him touch 95-96 mph at the ORGANIZATION, though he sat more in the 92-93 mph range early on this spring. He'll flash a plus slider and will show feel for a changeup, though not consistently, giving him the chance to have three at least average pitches to work with. He has a clean and easy delivery.One area of focus in GPE's development will surely be his command and control, which comes and goes. His athleticism and delivery point to improvement in that area and he got started on the long road to reaching his ceiling in the ORGANIZATION after signing.",-1
"In 2016, PERSON was the 36th-best GPE prospect according to ORGANIZATION. He might have gone that high if not for his strong commitment to PERSON, but instead was taken in the 36th round by the ORGANIZATION. Three years later, after batting .298 with 31 homers and 124 RBIs in 160 career games with the GPE, PERSON became the ORGANIZATION' first selection on Day 2 of the GPE, landing an above-slot bonus after they took him in the third round. Listed at 6-foot-5, 230 pounds, PERSON is a physical specimen. The left-handed hitter can really impact the ball with plus raw power and good leverage. He does draw a lot of walks, but there is also a good amount of swing and miss to his game, with some evaluators concerned about his ability to hit at the next level and get to that raw power consistently. PERSON's size limited him defensively at the hot corner at ORGANIZATION, which is why the ORGANIZATION immediately moved him across the infield to first base, where they believe he can become an average defender, with hands and arm strength that should serve him well.PERSON's junior year was enigmatic with a bit of a slow motor on the field. The raw power is legitimate, though, and the ORGANIZATION think he'll tap into it consistently as a pro now that he no longer has to worry about improving defensively as a third baseman.",-1
"Targeting college catching in the first two days of the 2019 Draft, the A's got an offensive-minded backstop in GPE McCann in the fourth round. They may have gotten his opposite in PERSON, who rivaled first-round pick PERSON as the best defensive catcher in college baseball, in the seventh round, giving the ORGANIZATION State product $170,000 to sign. He wasn't able to start his pro career this summer, as a right ORGANIZATION sprain suffered during sim games in GPE after he signed forced him to the 60-day injured list.PERSON is extremely athletic for his position, flashing above-average run times and moving around behind the plate like an infielder. He has soft hands and excels at blocking and receiving. He also has a strong and accurate arm, the leadership skills desired in a catcher and calls his own game -- a rarity in college. At the plate, he does offer some raw power, but got too wrapped up in trying to lift and drive the ball during a rough junior season offensively. He's a switch-hitter who's significantly better from the left side, and some evaluators wonder if he'd be better off giving up batting right-handed. Besides his swing-and-miss issues, there's also some concern that he's often nicked up with mild injuries, including a hamstring strain this spring and hip and shoulder woes in the past.The injury suffered after signing doesn't help allay those fears, so PERSON will have to prove he can be durable over the course of a full season in 2020. If it all comes together, he could be a very good glove-first starter behind the plate at the big league level.",-1
"PERSON endeared himself to scouts with solid performances during the summer and fall and continued to improve his ORGANIZATION stock as a senior, posting a 2.42 ERA with 116 strikeouts in 60 innings for GPE (ORGANIZATION.) High. He was believed to have a strong commitment to PERSON before the ORGANIZATION selected him in the fourth round and signed him for $650,000, above his slot's recommended value of $483,300. He would make his pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, posting a 1.76 ERA across 31 innings. PERSON may never develop overpowering stuff, but there's a lot to like in the left-hander's present feel for three pitches. He pitches with average velocity, sitting around 88-91 mph. He complements his fastball with a two-plane slider that flashes above average and a quality split-fingered fastball -- used in lieu of a changeup -- that bottoms out as it nears the plate. He throws all three pitches for strikes.PERSON's somewhat mature build still requires physical projection, and it suggests that he could develop more velocity in the coming years. His mechanics differ depending on whether he's working from the wind-up or stretch, but he's athletic enough to make the necessary adjustments to consistently repeat his delivery.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION deservedly have a reputation for developing young pitching, with many exciting arms reaching GPE in 2018 and many more to come. But it would be a mistake to look past the outfield pipeline as well. PERSON Jr. made a huge splash in GPE last year, PERSON is ready to attack the upper levels of the system and ORGANIZATION, taken from the ORGANIZATION high school ranks in the second round of the 2017 Draft and coming off a very successful first full season that included a GPE ORGANIZATION All-Star nod and a promotion up a level, caught up to PERSON and played alongside him in Double-A in 2019.ORGANIZATION has the chance to be an impactful hitter from both sides of the plate. Mechanical adjustments on his swing, particularly his stride, allowed him to be on time with his buggywhip stroke. He's better from the left side currently, but has shown the ability to make hard contact and drive the ball both ways, with raw power sure to turn into more consistent in-game pop as he matures. ORGANIZATION' plus speed works on the basepaths, where he is a threat to steal, and in the outfield, and he has every chance to stick in center field long-term.After a first full season in which ORGANIZATION' considerable tools showed up perhaps ahead of schedule, the ORGANIZATION are excited to see what the young outfielder can do as an encore. He has the chance to be a dynamic, elite-level performer, and seeing a young outfield of GPE, PERSON and ORGANIZATION -- yes, he has the arm and offensive profile for right field -- in GPE should excite all ORGANIZATION fans.",-1
"When PERSON emerged as one of the best high school prospects from the state of GPE, winning PERSON state player of the year honors, the obvious landing place for him in the 2017 PERSON was of course the ORGANIZATION, who love bringing in talent from their own backyard. After a hot start in the ORGANIZATION, the second-round pick struggled with a promotion to the GPE. But he clearly learned some lessons and has had a fantastic full-season debut in the LOCATION League in 2018.The toolsy outfielder made some solid adjustments at instructs last fall and it carried over into 2018, with the tweaks he made to his mechanics at the plate clearly helping him. He had tinkered quite a bit with his setup and they worked with him to stay with one approach, closer to what had worked for him in high school. He has a buggywhip of a swing, and work he did on his stride has helped him be on time more consistently, and that should continue to help him tap into his considerable raw power more consistently. PERSON has plus speed, which will continue to aid him on the basepaths and in center field, where he has the chance to stick.PERSON is a veritable toolshed who simply needs time and reps to use those tools consistently and have them turn into performance. All the pieces are there for him to potentially develop into a dynamic everyday player and he took a large step in the right direction in 2018.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION never shy away from drafting from their own backyard. So when GPE, part of another deep crop of GPE high school outfielders, backed up his strong summer showcase circuit with a senior season that led to winning the ORGANIZATION state player of the year award and a 7-A state title, they pounced in the second round. GPE signed for $1.5 million, a bit under pick value, and got off to a quick start in the ORGANIZATION League.A switch-hitter, GPE demonstrates more power from the left side of the plate. From the right side, he peppers the gaps with line drives. He has good feel for the barrel, has no problems handling quality fastballs and has the potential to hit for average and power.A good athlete, GPE has plus speed and uses it to steal bases and play a fine center field. He also has plus arm strength that would fit nicely in right field if he's needed there, and he was getting time in both center and right during his pro debut.",-1
"PERSON GPE's best mound prospect since PERSON went No. 1 overall in the 2002 GPE, PERSON initially joined the ORGANIZATION as a two-way player. He saw some action in the outfield in 2018, when he ranked second among ORGANIZATION Division I freshmen in strikeouts (97 in 72 innings). He opened 2019 with six no-hit innings against a loaded Stanford lineup and quickly established himself as the top age-eligible sophomore pitcher in the 2019 GPE while finishing fifth among DI hurlers in strikeouts-per-nine (14.33). He signed with PERSON for below slot value, then opened his pro career at ORGANIZATION A Short PERSON for pound, PERSON's fastball was perhaps the best in  his GPE class. Listed at 6 feet and 165 pounds, he has a lightning-quick arm that allows him to deal at 93-96 mph and tops out at 98 deep into games. The Mid-American conference pitcher of the year backs up his heat with a pair of hard breaking balls, a curveball with depth and a slider with more lateral break, and each can be a plus pitch at ORGANIZATION also has a changeup, though it's a bit firm and he doesn't use it very often. Though he dominated as a full-time starter in the spring, scouts worry that he's not big enough to handle the grind of taking the mound every five days in pro ball. He's athletic and doing a much better job of throwing strikes than he did a year ago, and it's easy to imagine him reaching triple digits with his fastball in that role. It's safer to project him as a reliever in the pro ranks, though PERSON will give him every opportunity to prove he can start.",-1
"PERSON didn't become a full-time pitcher until his senior season as a GPE high schooler, attracting little attention from scouts but earning a scholarship from GPE. He became the ORGANIZATION' closer as a freshman, set a program record with 17 saves as a sophomore and posted a 0.74 ERA and tied another school mark with his 32nd career save last spring. Signed for $559,600 as a third-round pick, he reached PERSON in his pro debut but has stalled in Double-A during his first full season.PERSON has a devastating pair of pitches that could make him a closer in the Majors, though neither has been as sharp as usual in 2019. His fastball combines 95-99 mph velocity with running action and deception at its best, though it has sat more at 94-96 this year. The wipeout mid-80s slider he had in 2018 hasn't been as hard or featured as much bite in Double-A.In addition to blowing hitters away, PERSON can also throw them off balance with a decent changeup. Though he has three pitches, he's definitely a reliever because he's relatively small and there's effort in his delivery. After doing a nice job of locating his pitches where he wanted a year ago, he has battled his control and command this season.",-1
"PERSON drew little attention from scouts as a short senior right-hander at ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, GPE) in 2015, his first season as a full-time pitcher. He blossomed at ORGANIZATION, setting a school record and placing second in ORGANIZATION Division I with 17 saves as a sophomore, then posting a 0.74 ERA and tying the ORGANIZATION' career mark with 32 saves this spring. Signed for $559,600 as a third-round pick, he could be the first 2018 draftee to reach the big leagues.PERSON's velocity increased during his freshman season, and he now works with a 95-97 mph fastball that peaks at 99 and features some running action. His power slider can be a wipeout pitch at times, arriving in the mid-80s with some depth. He also has a decent changeup that he can use to keep hitters off balance.Though he has three pitches, PERSON is strictly a reliever because he lacks size and has effort to his delivery. He's wiry, strong and durable, and he has improved his ability to locate his pitches. Also intelligent and competitive, he has a ceiling as a closer.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION surprised some by taking PERSON at the end of the first round of the GPE. But not only do they believe in the LOCATION high schooler's abilities, they were able to sign him for nearly $600,000 below pick value, enabling them to aggressively go after talent later on in the GPE.A coach's son -- PERSON played for his father at ORGANIZATION School -- he gets high marks for makeup and baseball IQ. A switch-hitter, he's shown an ability to hit from both sides of the plate. There should be power to come as he matures into his 6-foot-3 frame. A center fielder in high school, that's where he started his pro career in the ORGANIZATION after signing. Most feel, however, that he'll slide over to an outfield corner, given his average speed. He should throw well enough for right field, and could very well fit the offensive profile in the future. PERSON's passion for the game comes out in his play and he's sure to maximize his abilities as a pro, working to prove to everyone he was worthy of a first-round selection.",-1
"Hailing from the ORGANIZATION program in northern GPE that his dad coached, PERSON was one of two first-round picks the ORGANIZATION got at the end of 2016's opening round (ORGANIZATION was the other). Sent aggressively to full-season ball to start the '17 season, PERSON really struggled out of the gate, but righted the ship a bit after that, catching up to the level. Things began to come together for him in 2018, as he showed a mix of power potential and on-base skills at age 19 in the challenging Class A Advanced PERSON, and he broke out in earnest during his first Double-A campaign in '19, earning a ORGANIZATION Game selection along the way.PERSON is a switch-hitter who has some serious offensive potential. While his right-handed swing is more impactful and consistent, PERSON has made significant strides as a left-handed hitter in 2019 while regularly tapping into his plus raw power from both sides. His strong knowledge of the strike zone and pitch recognition are major assets, allow him to find more pitches to drive and tap into his power, which could be above-average in his prime. A good athlete and average runner, PERSON has held his own as a center fielder in Double-A but may fit better at a corner-outfield spot long term.PERSON has responded well to challenging assignments at every stage in his career, performing increasingly well against older competition in advanced leagues. With his high baseball IQ, feel for the strike zone and blend of hitting ability and power at the plate, PERSON is on his way toward becoming an everyday big leaguer.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION had the last two picks of the first round in the 2016 GPE. With the last one, they were able to get PERSON, who fell to them. Right before that, they reached a little bit for PERSON, who signed for $600,000 below pick value, which allowed them to go after talent later on in the GPE. PERSON has an interesting combination of tools and baseball IQ. He plays like the typical coach's son -- he played for his father at ORGANIZATION in GPE. He was young for the GPE, he'll play all of this year at age 18, and the ORGANIZATION are more than willing to be patient. He's shown some ability to hit from both sides of the plate and could very well grow into decent power as he fills out his athletic 6-foot-3 frame. PERSON was a center fielder in high school and the ORGANIZATION plan to let him stay up the middle as long as he can. Depending on how he fills out, he could move to a corner as ORGANIZATION already love how PERSON plays the game and how willing he is to work at it. That kind of makeup should allow him to maximize his tools as he starts the slow climb up the organizational ladder.",-1
"Hailing from the ORGANIZATION school program in northern GPE that his dad coached, PERSON was one of two first-round picks the ORGANIZATION got at the end of 2016's opening round (ORGANIZATION was the other). Sent aggressively to full-season ball to start the 2017 season, PERSON really struggled out of the gate, but righted the ship a bit after that, catching up to the level.PERSON has some serious offensive potential from both sides of the plate, with many evaluators believing he'll be able to get to an average hit tool because of his advanced approach. PERSON walked 11.5 percent of the time during his first full season. His strong knowledge of the strike zone should allow him to find more pitches to drive and tap into his power more consistently. Even when he was struggling, he didn't wear his at-bats and used it as a learning experience. A fringe-average runner, PERSON looks like he'll be athletic enough to play right field, where his strong arm that piled up 14 assists in 2017 profiles well.PERSON's baseball IQ, his feel for the strike zone and his offensive potential, give the ORGANIZATION hope for his future. How he adjusts from the adversity he faced in 2017 while moving to a new level will speak volumes about what kind of prospect he can become.",-1
"ORGANIZATION stands out as one of the more projectable high school arms in the 2016 Draft. He's 6-foot-7 and 220 pounds with the room to add a lot of strength. He also has good body control for a tall youngster, allowing him to repeat his delivery and throw strikes with ease. It was those characteristics that earned him an above-slot bonus as the ORGANIZATION' fourth-round pick in June, as he became the highest-drafted player to ever come out of GPE (Ky.) High. ORGANIZATION's fastball velocity increased steadily throughout his high school career. He operates at 88-93 mph, and his heater seems quicker because he gets good extension out front and his size creates tough angle and plane. He can throw his fastball to either side of the plate, with some sinking and tailing action.His secondary pitches are raw, but the ORGANIZATION are confident that both offerings will be average-or-better once fully developed. The right-hander has some shape but not much power to a curveball that he doesn't consistently stay on top of, and some scouts wonder if he'll need to switch to a slider. His changeup is also a work in progress.",-1
"The Rockies have long been active in acquiring talent via the international free agent market. They were particularly aggressive in the 2017-18 signing period, handing out 17 bonuses of $100,000 or more. PERSON was close to the top of that list, with the GPE infielder getting $750,000 to sign in July 2017. After two summers of hitting and running well in the ORGANIZATION, he made a seamless transition to the GPE in 2019 with a very strong showing in the rookie-level PERSON League.PERSON is an aggressive player on both sides of the ball. The right-handed hitter has a contact-oriented approach and doesn't draw many walks, though he also doesn't strike out much. He's already started adding strength and weight, so there could be more extra-base authority and power to come. A plus runner, he's already shown a love for stealing bases, swiping 54 in 51 games during his second ORGANIZATION summer. He's played both shortstop and second base and shown the potential to be better-than-average at both spots.There's a long way to go for the 19-year-old infielder, but there's a good amount of ceiling here. PERSON showing a penchant to hit over .300 and run, if he can continue to add strength, he has the potential to be an every day middle infielder in the fiture.",-1
"Signed for just $10,000 in 2015 out of GPE, PERSON's pro debut in 2016 saw him play in the ORGANIZATION, rookie-level ORGANIZATION and even the ORGANIZATION. He jumped on the scene with a strong showing back with PERSON in 2017, hitting for average and showing some emerging power.PERSON is a toolsy outfielder who does everything full-tilt. An aggressive hitter, he has a knack for making contact while swinging at almost everything, and he'll have to improve his approach as he moves up the ladder. There is extra-base pop now and he could develop more home run power as he matures physically and learns to be more selective. His speed works on both sides of the ball, showing basestealing ability and solid skills in center field. He has a strong arm to go with his range and instincts.It can be a mistake to ask a player like PERSON to tone things down too much because it's his energy and aggressiveness that make him an exciting player. Learning to reign it in just enough to succeed as the competition improves could allow him to move up prospect lists in a hurry.",-1
"Not every successful international signing has to be a big-ticket expenditure. If the early returns are any indication, PERSON, who signed for $100,000 in September 2015 out of GPE, will be one of those bargain finds. He hit his way out of the ORGANIZATION to make his GPE debut in his first summer, then took another big step forward in the Rookie-level PERSON in 2017.Gains in strength led to an uptick in power, and the D-backs think PERSON has a lot more growing to do. With increased power comes increased responsibility to understand the strike zone. PERSON's strikeout rate went up in 2017 and he didn't draw as many walks as he was too aggressive, attacking early in the count at times. As he progresses, the right-handed hitter will have to learn to lay off the steady diet of breaking stuff he's sure to get from right-handed pitching. PERSON selectivity should lead to even more in-game power. PERSON runs very well and can steal a base as well as cover ground in center field, where the D-backs think he could stay for a while.Even if he outgrows the position and has to move to a corner, he could have the offensive profile to be a regular as a five-tool right fielder. The D-backs don't have to worry about that decision yet, instead focusing on getting PERSON at-bats and watching the return on the investment grow.",-1

He throws a hard breaking ball in the 82-85 mph range that's more slider than curveball but lacks consistency at times. He also shows flashes of a solid changeup though it's often too firm to be truly effective.Miami has handled PERSON with care because he has as much upside as any pitcher in the system, and his 100 1/3 innings last year were a career high.

He has a compact stroke that allows him to make consistent contact and translates to outstanding raw power he is still learning to tap into on a regular basis. He has a solid approach at the plate and isn't afraid to draw walks. His best defensive tool is his arm and the ORGANIZATION think he has the hands and actions to stay at third long-term.

It translates to plus raw power that already plays in games to his pull side, and given his remaining physical projection, there surely will be more to come. He has a solid, if somewhat aggressive, approach at the plate and isn't afraid to draw walks. His best defensive tool is his arm, and the ORGANIZATION think he has the hands and actions to stay at third base long term.Others think he might outgrow the hot corner because his speed, range and footwork are all fringy. The good news is that if his bat continues to progress, he should have the offensive profile for either infield corner, with the potential to hit for a solid average while contributing 25-plus home runs from the middle of a lineup.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION remained active in the 2016-17 international signing period until the very end. Their spending spree concluded with a $1.9 million bonus for PERSON on June 15, the final day, and they had to pay a matching amount as a tax penalty for blowing past their allocated bonus pool. Before he defected, he saw limited action in GPE's PERSON and its 18-and-under league, posting a combined 6.83 ERA in 27 2/3 innings.PERSON is more about power than polish at this point. His fastball sat at 92-95 mph when he worked out for clubs, topping out at 97. His best secondary offering is a hard slider that arrives in mid-80s.PERSON has the athleticism and tall, strong build to make it as a starter, though he'll need some refinement. His curveball and changeup lag behind his other two pitches, and he doesn't have much experience using the changeup. His control and command also will have to improve.",-1
"After a so-so debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2015, PERSON started back there again the following summer, pitched his way to the GPE and continued to throw well in the Rookie-level PERSON. He advanced to full-season ball the following year, after a stop in the ORGANIZATION, before heading to the ORGANIZATION as the player to be named in the ORGANIZATION trade. PERSON has blossomed in GPE's system, showing a blend of pitchability and durability while climbing at a level-per-year pace. A tall and wiry right-hander, PERSON's stuff has slowly ticked up with his physical development. He'll top out at 93-94 mph but typically sits more in the 89-92 range with his fastball, throwing it with late life and commanding it well to both sides of the plate, and there could be more velocity in the tank as he continues to add strength. He shows a good feel for spinning a curveball that has both depth and bite and also has a changeup, though nothing he throws projects as a true plus pitch.PERSON has a smooth and effortless delivery that he repeats well, and it allows him to flood the zone with strikes. He understands how to sequence his three-pitch mix to keep hitters off balance, and while he may never miss a ton of bats, PERSON does generate a good amount of weak contact. That PERSON lacks a plus offering limits his ceiling, but there's a clear path for him to become a backend starter.",-1
"One of the fastest players in the 2015 Draft, PERSON hailed from the same LOCATION (PERSON, N.C.) program that spawned speedsters PERSON and ORGANIZATION. Signed for an above-slot $2 million as a second-round choice, PERSON led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION and ranked third in the Minors with 51 steals in his first full pro season. But he also scuffled at the plate, hitting .220/.277/.327 with a strikeout rate of 28 percent.PERSON obviously needs to do a better job of using his well above-average speed at the plate by making more contact. PERSON scouts liked his feel for hitting and he makes an effort to utilize the entire field, but he struggles to handle offspeed pitches. He has some deceptive pull power and could reach double figures in home runs once he makes some adjustments to his approach.PERSON does a good job of using his quickness. He succeeded on 81 percent of his steal attempts in his first two pro seasons and covers a lot of ground in center field. His arm is below average but isn't a liability.",-1
"All baseball teams covet athletes, but few have shown more willingness to pay what it takes to land them than the ORGANIZATION. Yet another example came when they drafted PERSON in the second round in June and gave him first-round money ($2 million) to sign.PERSON' most obvious tool is his speed. Though he ran a 6.32-second 60-yard dash at the LOCATION Professional Showcase in July 2014, he's more of a plus runner than a true burner. He still has more than enough wheels to steal bases and cover the gaps in center field, where his below-average arm isn't a liability.Unlike a lot of speedsters, PERSON can do more than just slap at the ball. He has quickness to his left-handed swing and some feel for manipulating the bat head. He won't be a slugger but he has some pull power and could reach double figures in homers once he adds strength.",-1
"Before the ORGANIZATION selected PERSON in the second round last June, GPE PERSON (PERSON, N.C.) had not had a player drafted since the ORGANIZATION popped PERSON in the 10th round in 1980. Like PERSON did, PERSON stands out most with his speed, but his superior all-around game earned him a $2 million bonus and should allow him to eclipse PERSON's modest big league career.Though PERSON ran a 6.32-second 60-yard dash at the LOCATION Professional Showcase in 2014, he's more of a well-above-average runner than a top-of-the-scale burner. He already has advanced basestealing instincts that helped him succeed on 28 of his 31 attempts in his pro debut. His quickness allows him to easily cover the gaps in center field, where his below-average arm isn't a liability.Unlike many speedsters, PERSON does more than just slap and run when he's at the plate. He has a quick left-handed stroke, feel for manipulating the barrel and some deceptive pull power. Once he adds some strength and refines his approach, he could hit for average and reach double figures in home runs.",-1
"PERSON became the new face of GPE baseball during the under-16 Pan-American Baseball Championship by striking out 12 batters in a win against the ORGANIZATION. He furthered that reputation by pitching two-thirds of an inning in relief for GPE in a 10-0 win against GPE in the World Baseball Classic qualifier last September in GPE. The performances earned PERSON the distinction as ORGANIZATION's No. 5 international prospect for his class, not to mention a $1.4 million deal from the ORGANIZATION when they signed him at the outset of the 2017-18 international signing period.Though listed at 5-foot-10, PERSON boasts stuff that belies his size and age. His fastball has touched 97 mph and now sits comfortably in the low 90s after he pitched mostly in the upper 80s prior to signing with ORGANIZATION. His curveball is a swing-and-miss offering and represents his best secondary pitch, receiving easy plus grades from evaluators, and his changeup projects to be at least average once fully developed. PERSON's arm action is clean and efficient, and he demonstrates the ability to repeat his delivery, a good sign for any young pitcher.PERSON has impressed scouts with his advanced approach on the mound and experience against top competition, though there is some concern about his overall upside and durability given his smaller frame. PERSON will begin to address some of those questions in 2018, when he makes his highly anticipated pro debut.",-1
"The new face of baseball in GPE, PERSON burst onto the scene last summer when he pitched for his country in the under-16 Pan-American Baseball Championship against the ORGANIZATION and struck out 12 batters in the win. He became an international sensation when he pitched two-thirds of an inning in relief for the country's team in the 10-0 win against GPE in the World Baseball Classic qualifier last September in GPE. After ranking No. 5 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list, PERSON inked a $1.4 million deal with the ORGANIZATION, which included an additional $200,000 to continue his education, at the outset of the 2017-18 international signing period. PERSON's fastball has touched 95 mph, but it usually hovers in the 90-93 mph range. His curveball is a swing-and-miss offering and represents his best secondary pitch, and scouts expect his changeup to be at least average once fully developed. PERSON's arm action is clean and efficient, and he demonstrates the ability to repeat his delivery.PERSON has impressed scouts with his advanced approach on the mound and experience against top competition, though there is some concern about his overall upside and projectability given his smaller frame.",-1
"ORGANIZATION ranked as ORGANIZATION's No. 5 prospect for the 2017-18 international period after an impressive amateur career in GPE before signing with ORGANIZATION for $1.4 million. The ORGANIZATION deemed him advanced enough to make the jump straight to the Rookie-level Appalachian League for his pro debut, and ORGANIZATION, just 17, rewarded the club's confidence by posting a 2.88 ERA over 50 innings and finishing third in the circuit in strikeouts (64). ORGANIZATION's stuff and feel for pitching is exceptional for his age. His velocity has ticked up since signing, giving him a low 90s fastball with late life that can touch 96 mph. He pairs his heater with a plus curveball, his best secondary pitch, and he added a slider in 2018 that already has the makings of becoming at least average. The same can be said about ORGANIZATION's promising changeup, also a relatively new pitch for him.Perhaps what's most impressive about ORGANIZATION is his ability execute his pitches as part of an overall game plan. His arm action and delivery are clean and repeatable, and he effectively compensates for being somewhat undersized by getting good extension over his front side. He still has quite a bit of development remaining, but all the ingredients are there for ORGANIZATION to develop into a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"PERSON was a known pitching prospect coming out of PERSON in GPE, but went undrafted in 2016, largely because of his strong commitment to GSP. He then spent nearly all three years of his ORGANIZATION's career in the rotation, pitching on weekends as a sophomore and junior. A strong final season landed him in the fourth round of the 2019 GPE, where the ORGANIZATION gave the left-hander $428,300 to sign.From a size and pure stuff standpoint, PERSON checks off the boxes. The 6-foot-5, 240-pound southpaw has the chance to have three pitches at his disposal. His fastball touches 96-97 mph at times, and his velocity crept upwards during the spring after starting the at 88-92 mph. He complements the heater well with a slider that's plus at times and he'll flash an above-average changeup as well. PERSON has struggled with command, with a stiff front side that has kept him from finding the strike zone consistently enough.Based on that stuff, PERSON is right there with the other college lefties taken earlier in the GPE. His command and delivery issues have led some evaluators to see a future in the bullpen, where his fastball-slider combination from the left side could lead to a ORGANIZATION Hader-like role in the future.",-1
"Yet another member of the ORGANIZATION' loaded 2013-14 international class, PERSON landed a $650,000 bonus out of GPE. Five games into his pro career, he blew out his elbow and required PERSON surgery. He recorded a 1.88 ORGANIZATION and 55/9 K/BB ratio in the lower levels of the system during his first extended action in 2016, but multiple DL trips with nagging injuries have marred his full-season debut this year.PERSON entered pro ball with an 87-91 mph fastball and now operates at 92-96 with power sink that generates a lot of swings and misses as well as groundouts. He has advanced feel for a changeup that shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch and continues to rank ahead of his slurvy breaking ball. After using a curveball earlier in his career, he's trying to refine a slider.PERSON doesn't have the smoothest delivery, yet he pounded the strike zone in his only fully healthy pro season. He offers more upside than most pitchers in the system, though that will mean little if he can't stay on the mound.",-1
"GPE of the ORGANIZATION' 2013 international spending spree, PERSON has posted one of the system's best ground-ball rates since signing for $650,000 out of GPE. But he also has had a difficult time remaining on the mound, blowing out his elbow and requiring PERSON surgery after five pro games. He dazzled with a 1.88 ORGANIZATION and 55/9 K/BB ratio in the lower levels of the system in his first full season back in 2016, but a sore shoulder limited him to 14 starts and diminished his performance in low Class A last year.When he's fully healthy, PERSON can generate groundout after groundout with the power sink and the downhill plane on his 92-96 mph fastball. His secondary pitches are more works in progress but show potential. He has feel for his changeup and while his curveball can get slurvy, he's doing better with it after also trying a slider.PERSON's health history and the effort in his delivery lead to questions about his ability to remain a starter. His walk rate more than tripled from 1.3 per nine innings in 2016 to 4.4 last year, which also doesn't help his cause. He needs innings to refine his repertoire and control, and missing the first two months of 2018 with more soreness means that he has yet to prove he can hold up over a full pro season.",-1
"Signed by the ORGANIZATION for $100,000 early in the July 2015 international period, PERSON opened eyes the next summer during his professional debut in his native ORGANIZATION.

When ORGANIZATION discovered the discrepancy, it barred him from signing for one year and he landed with the ORGANIZATION in March 2015 after producing a GPE birth certificate with a slightly different birthdate. His $200,000 bonus -- a fraction of what he would have commanded without the controversy -- looks like a bargain because he has the best all-around tools in GPE's deep system.PERSON has three tools that grade as well above average in his raw power, speed and arm strength. With the quickness and loft in his left-handed stroke, he's built to do a lot of damage at ORGANIZATION. The only question he has to answer is whether he can tone down his aggressive approach and make consistent contact after posting a 31 percent strikeout rate last season and a 36 percent mark in the ORGANIZATION. He lost some needed at-bats and development time when he had surgery on his right hamate in mid-May, a procedure that kept him out until July.While his swing-and-miss issues mean there's a wide gap between his ceiling and floor, PERSON doesn't have to hit for high average to help a team win. He's as raw on the bases as he is at the plate, but his double-plus speed could make him a 30-30 player if he adds the necessary polish. While he's still learning in center field as well, he should be able to stick there and his arm is a weapon anywhere in the outfield.",-1
"Then known as PERSON de GPE, an identity he assumed when registering for school in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON emerged as one of the top prospects in the 2014-15 international signing period. When ORGANIZATION uncovered the discrepancy, it declared him ineligible for one year.

Lean and athletic, he has well above-average raw power and arm strength as well as plus speed. A left-handed hitter built for ORGANIZATION, he uses the entire field but will need to temper his aggressive approach after striking out in 28 percent of his plate appearances last year.

He wasn't the same pitcher as a senior, however, leaving a mid-February start early due to shoulder tightness, an issue that was determined to be muscular but affected his stuff when he returned after a month-long layoff. The injury as well as a strong commitment to PERSON made PERSON a wild card heading into the GPE, though neither deterred the Indians from selecting him with the ORGANIZATION. 35 overall pick.

Radar-gun readings alone don't make his heater special, as it also has electric life and he can spot it to both sides of the plate, and he could dominate amateur hitters while relying almost entirely on his fastball if he wanted. But there were also times during the spring where his fastball parked around 90 mph with less movement than usual.PERSON also has a fading changeup that has the makings of a plus pitch, though he'll need to come up with a reliable breaking pitch to become a front-of-the-rotation starter. His hard curveball showed improvement during the summer and he also began trying a slider, though neither were particularly impressive during the spring.

Though PERSON held him to three innings in his pro debut, his shoulder issue was determined to be muscular in nature and he's expected to have no restrictions in 2019.When fully healthy, PERSON had the best fastball in the 2018 Draft, operating at 92-96 mph and reaching 98 with electric life and the ability to spot it to both sides of the plate. His fading changeup has the potential to become a plus offering, though his breaking pitches still need work. His hard curveball has its moments and he also has begun using a slider, but both were fringy for much of his high school senior season.PERSON generates his premium fastball with little effort in his delivery, which bodes well for his future health and command. He'll vary his tempo to throw off hitters' timing, at times throwing in a PERSON Cueto-like shimmy. He must add strength to his lanky 6-foot-6 frame and could add velocity once he does.",-1
"In a down year for high school catchers, PERSON ranked as the best in the 2019 crop and figured to go in the third round. Questions about his signability caused him to slip, however, and the ORGANIZATION were able to grab him in the sixth round. That still made him the first prep backstop selected and he signed for $950,000, the equivalent of late second-round money.Both PERSON's raw power and arm strength grade as plus tools. A left-hander, he generates plenty of pop to right field with his strength and aggressive, pull-oriented mindset. He has a quick release on his throws and has posted 1.9-second pop times to second base.PERSON will need time to develop because he lacks offensive and defensive polish. He many need to tone down his approach at the plate because he doesn't have a history of making consistent contact against quality pitching. He must continue to improve his receiving skills and his agility behind the plate, and he loses concentration more often than he should.",-1
"PERSON reached 96 mph with his fastball as a freshman reliever at ORGANIZATION State in 2016, but he also had trouble finding the strike zone and logged a 13.06 ERA. He blew out his elbow that summer and had PERSON surgery, sidelining him for all of 2017. He returned to the mound as a redshirt sophomore in 2018 and quickly emerged as the staff ace, and he was even better in '19 while pitching the ORGANIZATION to a ORGANIZATION World Series appearance.

The ORGANIZATION took PERSON with their first-round pick in June and signed him for $1.8 million, below slot value for the ORGANIZATION. 28 overall pick ($2.49 million). While many pitchers see their velocity increase after they complete the grueling rehab process after having their elbow reconstructed, PERSON doesn't throw as hard as he did in the past but is much more effective. His fastball ranges from 86-92 mph yet generates a lot of swings and misses -- he posted double-digit strikeouts in 11 of his 18 starts in 2019 -- and weak contact. He creates plane with his 6-foot-3 frame and high-three-quarters arm slot and deception with some crossfire and by varying the tempo of his delivery.PERSON also demonstrates significantly better feel for his changeup than he had before he got hurt, selling it with fastball arm speed and getting some fade on the mid-70s offering. He has a curveball with similar velocity and good depth, though he rarely uses it in games because he hasn't needed to. His control and command also are much improved since his PERSON surgery, giving him a high floor and a chance to be a ORGANIZATION. 4 starter.",-1
"PERSON established himself as a potential early-rounder in the 2019 Draft with a breakout performance at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship last fall, riding that momentum to a strong senior season. His advanced feel for pitching earned some comparisons to Kyle Hendricks but with better pure stuff. He landed the largest bonus outside of the top three rounds, giving up a ORGANIZATION commitment to sign for $1.5 million in the fifth. PERSON has a quick arm that produces 91-95 mph fastballs with natural sink and cut, and he could add more velocity as he continues to mature physically. He has the potential for three solid secondary pitches, with his upper-70s curveball consistently grading the best after he improved it during the spring. He also has a sharper slider in the low 80s and shows aptitude for a changeup with similar velocity and some sink.A good athlete who showed some right-handed power as a first baseman in high school, PERSON repeats his three-quarters delivery well. If he adds strength and develops more consistency with his secondary offerings, he could become a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"PERSON intrigued scouts as a GPE high schooler in 2015, but his ORGANIZATION commitment and rough delivery left him undrafted. He pitched sparingly for the ORGANIZATION as a freshman before academic ineligibility prompted his transfer to GPE (Fla.) JC for 2017. He won ORGANIZATION Pitcher honors at the ORGANIZATION World Series, helping the Indians capture their second national title and then signing for $826,500 as a supplemental second-round choice.PERSON's 6-foot-5 frame and low three-quarters delivery allow him to make lefties uncomfortable and get in on the hands of righties. He throws sinking two-seam fastballs in the low 90s and running four-seamers that can reach 95, both of which play up because of the difficult angle his size and arm slot create. His sweeping slider and changeup show flashes of becoming solid secondary offerings but still lack consistency.Though he generally throws strikes, PERSON will need to improve his command to remain a starter in pro ball. He missed a month during the spring with a blood clot and worked a combined 52 innings in two college seasons, so he'll need to establish he can hold up over a full pro season. If he's not durable enough to remain a starter, he could be an interesting bullpen option.",-1
"After two years in ORGANIZATION's penalty box for outspending their international bonus pool during the 2014-15 signing period, the ORGANIZATION faced no restrictions in 2017 and gave seven-figure bonuses to four different position players.

Not only did he come to the GPE for his 2018 pro debut at age 17, he also skipped a level and held his own as the youngest regular in the GPE, an advanced Rookie-level circuit.PERSON couples all-around talent with advanced instincts. He uses a compact, quick right-handed stroke and impressive hand-eye coordination to lace line drives all over the field, and his 33-percent strikeout rate last year was more reflective of his youth than his future hitting ability. He has gotten stronger since signing and should develop close to average power.PERSON has plus speed and presently uses it better in center field than on the bases. While he's still developing basestealing savvy, he already shows the ability to chase down balls from gap to gap. He also has solid arm strength and is capable of handling all three outfield spots.",-1
"As a penalty for splurging on the 2014-15 international market, the ORGANIZATION couldn't give out a bonus of more than $300,000 during the next two signing periods.

He was one of several toolsy outfielders in GPE's crop, which also included PERSON (ORGANIZATION) and PERSON (ORGANIZATION).One of the best all-around players in his international class, PERSON is a potential leadoff hitter and a no-doubt center fielder. Thanks to his quick, short right-handed swing and impressive hand-eye coordination, he makes line-drive contact with ease. He focuses on using the whole field rather than trying to yank balls out of the park, though he should develop some gap power.PERSON not only has plus speed, he already knows how to use it on the bases and in the outfield.

He has a power curveball that reaches the low 80s with tight spin and good depth, and he can vary it into a harder slider at times. He has upgraded the quality of his changeup and his trust in the pitch, which drops at the plate and could give him a third plus pitch.For a big teenager, PERSON has good body control and does a fine job of repeating his relatively easy delivery. PERSON liked how he took it upon himself to better his conditioning and firm up his previously soft frame.

In 2017, he averaged 13.9 strikeouts per nine innings and joined PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON as the only high school first-rounders this millennium to pitch in Double-A during their first full pro season. His encore wasn't as successful, as he worked just 26 1/3 regular-season innings because of a 50-game suspension for violating the ORGANIZATION drug program and minor oblique and lat injuries.PERSON got more work in the ORGANIZATION, where he was the developmental circuit's strikeout leader and showed why he's considered the best pitching prospect in baseball. He can make hitters look bad with his entire repertoire, starting with a 93-98 mph fastball with natural life (heavy sink down or cutting action up in the zone) and a devastating changeup with fade and depth. He has a pair of high-spin, power breaking balls with a 12-to-6 curveball and a late-biting slider, and he can turn the latter into a true cutter in the low 90s.PERSON has endured a puzzling 2019 season during which the quality of his stuff has fluctuated at times, and even so he got hit much harder than he should have in his first taste of Triple-A. His command has never been particularly sharp and has regressed this year, with scouts from other organizations raising questions about his focus and maturity. He still has the upside of a dominant ORGANIZATION. 1 starter but hasn't looked like one as often as he had in the past.",-1

He starred on the high school showcase circuit and with the GPE national-18-and-under team after his junior season, then dropped 25 pounds and looked better than ever as a senior. The ORGANIZATION liked him as much as any high school pitcher in the 2016 ORGANIZATION and were delighted to select him 17th overall and sign him for $3,148,000.PERSON projects to have four solid-or-better pitches, starting with a 92-95 mph fastball that tops out at 97, could have more velocity to come and features cutting and running action. He has a power curveball that peaks in the low 80s with good depth and tight spin, and he can turn it into a mid-80s slider when he wants. He has an advanced changeup for a pitcher fresh out of high school and already trusts it.Though PERSON has good body control for a youngster with an extra-large frame, the ORGANIZATION still are having him pitch exclusively out of the stretch to help him repeat his delivery.

He missed the start of this season after drawing a 50-game suspension in February for violating the ORGANIZATION drug program, then picked up right where he left off after he returned in June.PERSON can miss bats with all four of his pitches. His best is his fastball, a nasty combination of velocity (92-97 mph), cutting and running action plus steep downhill plane. After doing a terrific job as a high school senior of trimming what had been a soft body, he has room to add more strength and could throw harder once he does.PERSON backs up his heater with a hard 12-to-6 curveball, a power slider that flashes late bite and a fading changeup that he already trusts. Though he has good body control for a young pitcher with a huge frame, PERSON had him pitch exclusively out of the stretch at times last season to have him focus on repeating his delivery.

He has a strong arm and some solid actions behind the plate, but he'll have to improve his overall receiving. That PERSON has a thicker build and is already very strong for his age does lead to some concerns about his body, and he likely will have to watch his conditioning.

He is already physically imposing at 6-foot-4, and has already impressed the player development staff with his desire to put the work in to improve. The building blocks are already solid, with a fastball he can crank up to 96 mph with movement and the chance for there to be more consistently as he matures. His slider has the chance to be a true out pitch for him in time and he even has the feel for a changeup, giving him the chance to eventually have three at least average pitches. He's still learning how to pitch, but his command should improve as he gets more mound time.The ORGANIZATION have some experience in developing young, big right-handers, having ushered PERSON up the ladder.

The 6-foot-4 hurler has the body and potential repertoire to a solid starting pitcher. He'll throw his fastball up to 96 mph consistently and he misses plenty of bats with that and a slider that could eventually be a plus out pitch. He's working on his changeup, but shows a feel for it. The biggest issue plaguing PERSON is consistency in his delivery and, as a result, command, as he's posted hefty walk rates thus far in his pro career.

"GPE ranked fifth in ORGANIZATION Division I in GPE (1.58) and sixth in GPE (0.83) as a junior at GPE last spring, becoming the highest-drafted pitcher in GPE history when the ORGANIZATION took him in the fourth round. He lived up to his reputation for advanced pitchability after signing for a below-slot $347,500 and also opened eyes when his fastball jumped about 3 mph in his first pro summer.One of several GPE pitching prospects who are throwing harder as pros than they did as collegians, GPE worked at 90-95 mph for GPE and sat at 94-98 in his debut. Even at lower velocities, his heater was effective because he commands it well to both sides of the plate. He also throws a mid-80s slider with tight break and has some feel for a changeup, though both of his secondary pitches usually grade as average.With his strong build and a sound delivery that he repeats well, GPE should have the durability and pitch efficiency needed for a starter. To stay in that role, he'll probably need to improve either his slider or changeup to give him a solid second offering. His floor as a back-of-the-rotation option appealed to the ORGANIZATION when they drafted him and now his ceiling is more appealing.",-1

PERSON's breaking ball is inconsistent, with what he calls a slider actually more effective when it has curveball shape and shows flashes of becoming a solid offering.PERSON has some aptitude for throwing a changeup, and he pounds the strike zone with ease. He has a strong build and a sound, athletic delivery that bode well for him holding up as a starter. PERSON's floor stands out more than his ceiling, but his encouraging entry into pro ball gives hope that he could fit toward the back of a big league rotation one day.",-1

He spent his first two years as a pro in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION, didn't make his GPE debut until 2018 and probably won't reach full-season ball until 2020. He's one of the more promising young hitters in the system, however, and needed just 11 games this summer to match his previous career high for homers with five.GPE's carrying tool is his plus raw power to all fields. His chances of maximizing his home run production are enhanced by his feel to hit from the right side of the plate. He makes consistent hard contact, manages the strike zone well and doesn't get too pull-conscious.While most of GPE's value comes from his offense, he's a decent athlete who makes up for his below-average speed with his instincts. He provides average range and arm strength on the outfield corners. He also earns praise for his intelligence and is fluent in both GPE and GPE.",-1

But right shoulder tendinitis sidelined PERSON out of the gate in 2019, and while he returned to the mound for GPE in May, he was placed back on the disabled list with shoulder woes after just one start.

His velocity spiked, touching the mid-90s at times throughout his senior season. He complemented that heater with a power curve, showing a good feel for spinning it. There is some feel for a changeup as well. PERSON didn't pitch at all until he was a junior, and didn't focus on it until this last spring, so everything is raw and projectable.

He pitched sparingly in the ORGANIZATION during his pro debut, but he has shown some glimpses of the kind of pitcher he can become.PERSON's PERSON profile jumped because of an increase in velocity with his fastball. He will now sit in the low-90s and touches 95-96 mph at times, and with his projectable 6-foot-3 frame, it's easy to dream about more velocity to come as he fills out. His fastball already plays up some because of his extension and ability to throw downhill, with good finish at the end. He has a good feel to spin his breaking ball, a power curve that should be at least average, and he's already shown progress with his changeup.A solid athlete who didn't pitch until his junior year, PERSON still has a lot to learn, but that athleticism should allow him to find a repeatable delivery and to throw strikes.

He tops out at 96 mph and should settle in at 93-94 mph, a pitch that plays up because of his excellent extension and finish.

He's started to tap into raw power more consistently in games in 2019, especially to his pull side, where most of his home run pop has come. A decent runner who is better underway, GPE has mostly played second base since his debut summer, when he split time between second and short. He has the arm for the left side of the infield, but not the range to play up the middle on that side on a daily basis.GPE does have the skills to move around the infield -- he's seen time at both short and third over the last two seasons -- and likely profiles best as a utilityman with some pop. If it all clicks for the 22-year-old, he could be an offensive-minded regular at second base.",-1
"A seventh-round pick out of a GPE high school in 2015, PERSON turned down the opportunity to play at ORGANIZATION CC and signed for $200,000. He spent his first two pro seasons in GPE ball before making the jump to low Class A in 2017, when he has emerged as the ORGANIZATION' best second-base prospect.PERSON has more power potential than most second basemen. A right-handed hitter with strength and the bat speed to catch up to good fastballs, he has the upside to provide 30 doubles and 15 homers per year. To get there, he'll have to incorporate a more disciplined approach as he moves up the ladder. PERSON will have to hit to find a role in the big leagues. Drafted as a shortstop, he became a full-time second baseman two months into his pro career. He has good hands, but his fringy speed and average arm strength don't lend themselves to playing on the left side of the infield or serving a utility role.",-1
"There have been three position players from GPE to make it to the big leagues, with two -- Yan PERSON and PERSON -- getting any kind of significant playing time. PERSON, signed in October 2015 at age 16, has a long way to go, but if his play at the lower levels of the D-backs system, not to mention for GPE in the World Baseball PERSON, is any indication, he should be next in line. The ORGANIZATION saw enough of him to make sure he was included in GPE's trade for PERSON Escobar.A switch-hitter, PERSON has the chance to hit, with an advanced idea of how to control the strike zone, especially given how young he is, with the outfielder making huge strides in his approach between 2016 and 2017. He has added some strength, but needs to add more. It's not that power is ever going to be a part of his game, but he will be able to impact the ball more as he physically matures. PERSON's pure speed is definitely a plus, though he doesn't always get to that in games. He will learn to become a better basestealer and he can cover ground in center field easily.PERSON's path to becoming a big league contributor is with his legs, his defense and his ability to get on base. He has the chance to develop into an exciting table-setter at the highest level.",-1
"PERSON got noticed after playing well for PERSON at the 18-and-under World Cup in GPE, and the D-backs signed him soon thereafter. He came to the GPE for his pro debut and ran his way across two Rookie-ball levels before impressing those who saw him suit up for PERSON again at the World Baseball PERSON in GPE last fall.The teenager has the makings of a potential future table-setter thanks to his well above-average speed, which allowed him to finish third in the system in stolen bases despite playing in just 60 games. He's still new to switch-hitting, yet has a good approach at the plate and has consistently good at-bats. He's gained some strength, though power is never going to be a part of his game. PERSON had been a second baseman previously, but he has moved to center field as a pro. He has good range and a solid arm and will only improve his reads and routes as he gets more reps.PERSON is just 18 years old, so he is just getting started. Given his age, it's already impressive what he's been able to do and exciting to see what he does next.",-1
"While PERSON has produced some big league talent over the years, development of baseball in that country is obviously well behind other countries in the hemisphere. GPE picked up baseball mostly because he had GPE neighbors, so his fundamentals are understandably raw. Still, the D-backs saw enough potential in the outfielder to give him $90,000 to sign in October 2015 and the ORGANIZATION liked him enough to acquire him close to last year's PERSON in the ORGANIZATION deal.GPE has shown off certain tools in the early stages of his career, most notably his speed and ability to defend. He does manage the strike zone fairly well, limiting his strikeouts and drawing some walks, which gives the switch-hitter the chance to hit for average as he progresses. He's fairly strong for his size, but he needs to add more to truly impact the ball consistently and he'd have to alter his swing path in order to have any real power, something that has not shown up yet. A very good defender in center field, GPE uses his speed well to run down fly balls, and could be an even more effective base stealer in time.The ORGANIZATION are optimistic there's more growth to come from GPE given his lack of experience before he entered pro ball. He has the toolset to be a solid fourth outfielder, but if the bat develops, he could end up being more than that.",-1
"Signed out of GPE in 2015 after performing well at the 18-and-under World Cup in GPE, PERSON hit .281 with 22 steals between two Rookie-ball stops in his pro debut in 2016.PERSON's game is built around well-above-average speed, which makes him dangerous on the bases and allows him to cover ground in center field, where he shows the makings of a future plus defender. At the plate, the switch-hitter has good feel for the barrel from both sides. PERSON will never offer much in the way of power, but he consistently hits the ball on the ground to utilize his wheels.Slightly built and lacking in physicality, PERSON will need to get significantly stronger to handle better pitching at higher levels. He'll require time to develop, but the tools are there for him to become a potential top-of-the-order contributor at a premium position.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $25,000 in August 2016 because they liked the athleticism and tools and believed he could develop into a well-rounded catcher. After a nondescript pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, the ORGANIZATION native moved stateside in 2018 and promptly raked to the tune of .413/.455/.652 in the ORGANIZATION, earning a promotion to the GPE League after his first 23 games. PERSON's knack for making hard contact is a product of his outstanding hand-eye coordination and his preternatural feel for getting the barrel to the ball. He's cognizant of those strengths to a fault at times, as he'll often attack pitches outside of the zone simply because he can reach them. At the same time, PERSON neither strikes out nor walks all that often. There's enough juice in his bat to safely project double-digit home run totals, though his profile likely will be hit-over-power. Defensively, PERSON impresses club officials with his athleticism and energy behind the plate, and they believe he has a chance to stay there long term. His arm strength is average but plays up because he has solid catch-and-throw skills which culminate with a quick release. Like any young catcher, he has a ways to go with his blocking and receiving, but all the ingredients are there for PERSON to develop into a big league backup, perhaps even a regular.",-1
"One of the best hitters in the class, PERSON might also be the best infield prospect out of GPE this year. The teen has a projectable body and good control on both sides of the ball that reminds some scouts of PERSON at the same age. Targeting his upside, the GPE inked PERSON for $2.1 million at the outset of the 2018-19 international period after he had ranked as ORGANIZATION's No. 6 international prospect. PERSON might not be the best runner on the field at any given moment, but he could be the most well-rounded. Scouts like his easy actions at shortstop and smooth swing at the plate. Evaluators have taken note of his emerging raw power and an arm that is strong enough to move to third base if he has to switch positions. PERSON's tools might lack the ""wow factor"" that some of the other top international prospects possess, but he was considered one of the most consistent, and therefore, one of the most coveted prospects on the market.",-1
"PERSON's all-around potential and his track record of hitting in tournament competition made him the ORGANIZATION' top target in the 2018 international crop. They signed the ORGANIZATION as soon as he became eligible for $2.1 million, a franchise record for an international position player. PERSON has invested in several shortstops from the worldwide market in recent years, and none has a higher ceiling than PERSON.While he doesn't have a wow tool, PERSON has average to solid ability across the board and the instincts to get the most out of it. He's an advanced hitter for a teenager, displaying a disciplined approach and a willingness to use the entire field. His hitting acumen, solid bat speed and projectable strength give him a good chance to develop average power.PERSON has average speed but could lose a half-step as he matures physically. If that happens, most scouts think he'll wind up at third base, where his bat and solid arm would fit nicely. The ORGANIZATION think his body control, actions and arm can keep him at shortstop and they'll try to do so as long as possible.",-1
"A starter at ORGANIZATION State since the start of his freshman year, GPE showed improvement in each season, hitting .269 as a freshman, then improving to .332 in his sophomore year. He saved his best for last as one of the better performers in Division I this spring, slashing .369/.426/.648 with career-high totals in every offensive category. The ORGANIZATION were pleased to find GPE still on the board for their fifth-round pick, and he quickly rewarded the organization by reaching full-season ball during his pro debut. The 5-foot-11 left-handed hitter can really swing it with a line-drive approach and extra-base ability, though it's never likely to be major home run power. He does have some swing and miss in his game, though his walk rate increased as a junior to help offset it. While GPE has excellent speed, he has not been an efficient basestealer. After playing corner outfield spots his first two seasons, he's showing he can play center field and should get the chance to play there at the next level.GPE gets respect from scouts as being a ""baseball player,"" one who can do the little things to help a team win. Such intangibles, in addition to his four average-or-better tools, could make GPE a solid fourth outfielder in time, perhaps even more if he can continue to add power to his game.",-1
"A three-year starter at ORGANIZATION, GPE showed improvement in each season, hitting .269 as a freshman, then improving to .332 in his sophomore year before erupting to slash .369/.426/.648 with career-high totals in every offensive category as a junior. He remained on the board until the fifth round, where he was selected by the ORGANIZATION, and then rewarded the organization by reaching full-season ball during his pro debut after signing for slot value.GPE employs a line-drive approach and shows extra-base ability from the left side of the plate, albeit with below-average over-the-fence power and swing-and-miss tendencies that he'll need to tone down. He has plus speed, but has not been an efficient basestealer. After playing corner outfield spots his first two seasons, he made the move to center field as a junior and then saw time at all three spots (center and right field, primarily) during his pro debut.GPE gets respect from scouts as being a ""baseball player,"" one who plays with high energy and can do the little things to help a team. Such intangibles, in addition to his four average-or-better tools, could make him a fourth outfielder in time, perhaps more if he can add power to his game and prove capable of sticking in center field.",-1
"PERSON had a reputation as one of the most polished high school pitchers in GPE coming into 2015, but he didn't became a prime Draft prospect until his frame and stuff got stronger this spring. The ORGANIZATION selected him in the fourth round and signed him for $746,000.PERSON's fastball has improved from 85-88 mph in the summer of 2014 to 89-93 this year. He commands his fastball well and can bust it inside on the hands of righties. He also has some feel and depth to his curveball, though it needs more power and consistency.Though he worked mostly with his fastball and curve in high school, PERSON already has some aptitude for throwing a changeup.

"Long considered one of the most polished arms in the LOCATION 2015 high school class, PERSON started rising up ORGANIZATION boards when his body and stuff got stronger as a senior. He allowed just one earned run in 64 1/3 innings and pitched his way to a well over-slot $746,000 bonus as a fourth-rounder. He didn't make his pro debut last summer because the ORGANIZATION wanted him to continue to add muscle.PERSON's fastball jumped from 85-88 mph during the 2014 summer showcase circuit to 89-93 last spring. He has advanced fastball command for his age and isn't afraid to throw it inside against right-handers. He also has aptitude for spinning his curveball, which has depth but could use more velocity and consistency.He didn't need to use his changeup much as an amateur, but PERSON has some feel for what should become at least an average pitch. He has a fluid delivery and repeats it well, allowing him to locate his pitches where he wants. While he won't blow hitters away, he has a higher floor than most prep pitchers and a chance to become at least a No. 4 starter.",-1
"PERSON had a difficult time figuring out PERSON, who got caught up selling out for power on the high school showcase circuit and was slowed by mononucleosis during his senior season. He impressed the ORGANIZATION during a pre-Draft workout at ORGANIZATION, depositing multiple balls into ORGANIZATION and drilling one off of the top of the right-field foul pole. They drafted him in the fifth round and signed him for a well over-slot $797,500.PERSON has the ingredients to hit for both average and power, though it's unclear exactly what type of hitter he'll become. He employed a shorter, smoother left-handed swing when he came back from mono and displayed the ability to barrel balls regularly. His bat speed and the leverage and projectable strength in his 6-foot-3 frame give him considerable raw pop, though he doesn't always let it come naturally.PERSON has fringy speed out of the batter's box and is average underway. He moves well around the bag at first base and has a decent arm. There's some thought that he could handle left field, though that might be a stretch if he slows down once he gets bigger.",-1
"PERSON threw a shutout to win the title game of the heavily scouted 2015 World Wood Bat Association World Championship showcase, but his polish stood out more than his stuff. That contributed to him going undrafted the following June, as did his commitment to GPE. He fit the same profile in 2019, but three years of success as a member of a weekend rotation in the LOCATION got him picked in the fifth round of the 2019 Draft.PERSON lacks a true plus pitch, but he has several effective offerings and there's no clear consensus as to which is his best. Though his fastball velocity is nothing special at 88-91 mph and a peak of 93, his heater plays up because he sinks and commands it so well, and it works well in concert with his changeup that features similar movement. He has improved his curveball this year, and both it and his slider/cutter can be solid pitches.Without overpowering stuff, PERSON has little margin for error and thrives by limiting his mistakes. He has tremendous feel for locating, manipulating and sequencing his pitches, and he tossed shutouts against two of the ORGANIZATION's better clubs (ORGANIZATION and GPE) last spring. He tunnels his offerings well, adding to his deception and his chances of becoming a No. 4 or 5 starter.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON with the ORGANIZATION. 13 overall pick in the 2015, making him the first player to ever be drafted out of GPE (N.Y.) High. The rawness associated with such a distinction was obvious during his first two seasons, when PERSON appeared behind the talent curve at two lower levels before finishing 2016 on a high note. That success carried over into PERSON's 2017 full-season debut, as he made significant gains in all facets of the game as a member of Class A Bowling Green.

Right now, it's his defensive work that stands out. He's very athletic and moves well in the infield, with the actions, hands and arm to stay at shortstop long-term. The teenager has started to fill out his frame and has gained a lot of strength. That, in turn, is allowing him to drive the ball more consistently. He already has an advanced approach at the plate, one that allowed him to walk (60) much more than he struck out (37) during his ORGANIZATION debut.While PERSON isn't a burner, he runs and moves well, stealing 16 bases last summer. He still has a long way to go, but the pieces are there for him to hopefully develop into an everyday shortstop at the big league level.",-1
"PERSON trained with the ORGANIZATION's PERSON before receiving $75,000 to sign with the ORGANIZATION in July 2016. He began his pro career in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION in 2017 and came to the GPE this year. He needed just four outings in the Rookie-level PERSON before GPE decided his stuff and pitchability merited a promotion to low Class A at age 19.Though he's not very physical at a listed 6 feet and 154 pounds, PERSON has a quick arm that delivers 92-95 mph fastballs that climb as high as 97 with heavy sink. He already shows flashes of two plus secondary pitches as well. His changeup overmatches lower-level hitters and is more advanced that his curveball at this point.PERSON not only throws strikes but also pounds the bottom of the strike zone. Even if he adds strength, he'll lack the size of a typical starter, so he'll have to prove he can hold up over the course of a long pro season. Because he already has the makings of a quality repertoire and repeats his delivery well, GPE will give him every opportunity to remain in the rotation.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION spotted PERSON while he was training with the ORGANIZATION's PERSON and signed him for $75,000 in 2016. What he lacks in physicality he makes up for with competitiveness, which was evident in his GPE debut last year. He needed just four outings in the Rookie-level PERSON to earn a promotion to low Class A, where he posted a 1.65 ERA in nine starts at age 19 despite seeing his fastball dip into the upper 80s by the end of the year.When he's fresh, PERSON has a quick arm that produces 92-95 mph fastballs that reach 98 mph with heavy sink. He has advanced feel for a tumbling changeup that he sells with deceptive arm speed, though it has lost some effectiveness in 2019. He has good shape to his curveball, which could give him a third solid-or-better offering if he can add more power to it.Though he has gotten stronger since turning pro and weighs at least 25 pounds more than his listed weight of 154, PERSON's size creates concerns about his ability to maintain his stuff and health as a starter. He helps his cause by not only throwing strikes but also keeping his pitches down in the strike zone. He throws with little effort and repeats his delivery well, two more points in his favor.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION went over their entire bonus pool to land PERSON in July 2014, signing the promising GPE shortstop for $3.1 million and incurring a penalty tax in the process. He opened his pro debut on a tear last summer in the Rookie-level PERSON, hitting .370 over his first 19 games, but wore down as the season progressed and hit just .165 over his final 32 contests at the level. The ORGANIZATION still rewarded the then-17-year-old with a promotion to the Rookie-level PERSON, setting up his return to the level in 2016.PERSON stands out most for his offensive potential. He combines physical strength and bat speed to generate plus raw power from the right side of the plate, though his swing does involve considerable effort, and he tends to get too stiff when he tries to juice the ball. The ORGANIZATION want him to isolate and get better use of his hands, which they believe will be the key to unlocking his natural hitting ability and power. With enough contact, he should clear plenty of fences in his pro career. Defensively, PERSON impressed the ORGANIZATION with his glove, range and arm strength at shortstop in his pro debut. However, most evaluators expect that he'll have to move off the position as he grows into his impressive 6-foot-2, 190-pound frame, with third base, where he saw time during instructional league last fall, representing his likely long-term defensive home. PERSON may need many years to develop his game in the Minors, but there's no question among scouts that he has the raw tools to become a successful big leaguer.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $3.1 million in July 2014, blowing well past their designated bonus pool to land the GPE shortstop and incurring a penalty tax in the process. He stood out early in his career more for his defense rather than the hitting ability that the ORGANIZATION had coveted, and after four seasons in their system, he was dealt to the Nationals with K.J. PERSON for PERSON in August 2018. Apparently a change of scenery was all that PERSON needed, as his bat finally began to catch up to his glove in 2019, as he garnered midseason All-Star honors in the Class A ORGANIZATION before advancing to Class A Advanced Potomac in July. A 6-foot-4 right-handed hitter, PERSON combines strength and bat speed to generate plus raw power from an open stance. He continues to be a streaky hitter, though, with swing mechanics that are inconsistent at times and result in too much swing-and-miss. Defensively, PERSON has impressive body awareness and range for a player his size, with hands, feet and arm strength that fit well at either position on the left side of the infield. Though he hasn't developed as quickly as initially expected for such a highly-touted international signee, PERSON still boasts some impressive physical tools. Still only 21, he has plenty of time for his skills to catch up to his raw talent.",-1
"PERSON ranked as the ORGANIZATION. 4 overall international amateur prospect heading into the July 2 signing period in 2014, and the ORGANIZATION went over their entire bonus pool, incurring a penalty tax, to give PERSON a bonus north of $3 million to sign.The ORGANIZATION were not alone in coveting the infielder's bat. He has tremendous raw power, showing the ability to drive the ball in various prospect leagues in the ORGANIZATION. There is work to be done on his swing, which tends to be all-or-nothing and out of control, but he has a ton of bat speed. With enough contact, he should clear plenty of fences in his pro career. A shortstop as an amateur, it is almost universally believed he'll need to move to another position. Third base or perhaps an outfield corner, where his solid arm would work well, could be in his future.PERSON is just embarking on his professional career, so the ORGANIZATION will have to wait quite some time for a return on their considerable investment.",-1
" PERSON performed well for GPE teams at a variety of international tournaments, including the 2011 Cal PERSON as a 12-year-old, the 2013 Pan GPE 15-and-under championships and the 2015 ORGANIZATION. His combination of tools and polish earned him a $2.5 million bonus from the ORGANIZATION in 2015. He made his GPE debut at age 17 in 2016 and held his own as one of the youngest regulars in the Rookie-level GPE League last year. He was making another strong step up to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in 2018 when he was sent to the Twins in the ORGANIZATION Pressly deal. PERSON has done nothing to dispel the PERSON comparisons that started when he was an amateur. They're both skilled center fielders with strong arms and instincts that stand out more than their pure speed, and their hitting ability is more promising than their power potential. The biggest difference between the two is that PERSON is less physical, and he still needs to prove he can make enough impact at that plate to become an everyday player in the big leagues. A rare player who bats right-handed but throws left-handed, PERSON has a handsy stroke that sprays line drives to all fields. He has the bat speed to reach double digits in home runs, though he'll need to continue to add strength, incorporate his lower half into his swing and hit more balls in the air to get there. He has solid speed and the savvy to steal bases.",-1
"Though he's still a teenager, PERSON has a long track record at performing at international events such as the 2011 Cal PERSON (when he was 12), the 2013 Pan GPE 15-and-under championships and the 2015 ORGANIZATION. His combination of tools and aptitude led the ORGANIZATION to sign him for $2.5 million out of the ORGANIZATION in '15. He came to the GPE at the end of his 2016 pro debut, when he was the Rookie-level Gulf Coast PERSON's youngest regular (age 17) in the final month.Scouts constantly liken PERSON to the ORGANIZATION' PERSON, and the comparison works on multiple levels. They stand out most as skilled defenders in center field whose instincts help them play well above their average speed, and their hitting ability is more impressive than their power potential. They may not have lofty ceilings, but they have high floors and should become solid contributors in the big leagues.A rare lefty thrower who hits right-handed, PERSON has an advanced feel for hitting and walked (25) more than he struck out (23) in his introduction to pro ball in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION. He has a quick bat and could grow into average power as he matures physically. He shows some savvy on the basepaths and owns a strong, accurate arm.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION were aggressive on the international market during the 2015-16 signing period, handing out five bonuses of six figures or more. PERSON was the prize acquisition and got a $2.5 million bonus to sign out of the ORGANIZATION after starring for a number of youth teams in international competition. He had made it to the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in 2018 and was thriving there when he was sent to the ORGANIZATION as part of the ORGANIZATION Pressly deal.PERSON finished the rest of the summer in the GPE League and the coaching staff in GPE felt he was one of the best defenders they've seen at that level. He has tremendous instincts in center field with an above-average arm, allowing him to play a plus center field despite not being a burner speed-wise. The bigger question is whether his bat can catch up to his glove. He has shown plenty of ability to make contact, but it's a more line-drive to the gaps oriented approach right now. Some of that is because of his swing path and some of that stems from his need to add strength.Just 20 for all of the 2019 season, there's plenty of time for PERSON to grow into some power, and he has the bat speed to get there. If that part of his game develops, he could be a dynamic regular playing up the middle.",-1
"One of the more advanced players in the 2015 international class, PERSON has a long track record of performing, both at international events such as the 2011 Cal PERSON (he was 12) and the 2013 15-and-under PERSON championships and during game action in the ORGANIZATION. Impressed by his aptitude, the ORGANIZATION signed him for $2.5 million last June.He impresses scouts with his ability in center field, drawing comparisons to the ORGANIZATION' PERSON because he's a quality defender despite just average speed. PERSON has tremendous instincts, reading balls off the bat and taking direct routes to chase down balls from gap to gap. His average arm strength plays up too because he gets rid of the ball quickly and makes accurate throws.A rare lefthanded thrower who hits right-handed, PERSON has a quick bat and feel for hitting. While his swing can get long at times and there was less scouting consensus about his bat than his glove, PERSON believes that he'll make consistent contact and could have average power once he matures physically.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION have high hopes for their 2017 international class, which included 66 signees and what looks like an absolute steal at $10,000 in GPE. Solely a right-handed hitter when he signed out of the ORGANIZATION, he began switch-hitting after turning pro and fared better as a lefty (.350/.416/.478) than a righty (.204/.259/.204) while earning the organization's Latin program position player of the year award for his 2018 debut. He's both extremely raw and one of the best athletes in the system.GPE's game is built around plus-plus speed, though he's still in the early stages of figuring out how to use it. He has the quickness to be a prolific basestealer yet was caught 14 times in 30 attempts last year. He needs to improve his reads and jumps on the bases and in center field, where he can cover a lot of ground and shows average to solid arm strength.GPE has a slappy approach at the plate and is an extreme ground-ball hitter whose speed creates a lot of infield hits. He probably won't have much power, with 10 homers a year being a realistic ceiling, so he'll need to concentrate on getting on base. He already makes consistent contact from both sides of the plate but needs to draw more walks.",-1
"One of the better high school shortstops in the 2016 Draft, PERSON slid to the 26th round (ORGANIZATION) because he wanted to play at ORGANIZATION. His grandfather PERSON was an All-American for the GPE in baseball and basketball before appearing in six All-Star Games with the GPE, and his father PERSON and uncle GPE (another big leaguer) also played for PERSON. PERSON viewed PERSON as a steady player with underwhelming tools until he hit .405 in LOCATION in 2019, propelling him into the second round and an under-slot $750,000 bonus.PERSON has a history of making contact with a controlled right-handed stroke and a line-drive approach, but he was a career .248 hitter in college before ORGANIZATION play began in March. He began hitting the ball harder last spring and the ORGANIZATION think they can help him utilize more of what they believe is untapped power. He has the patience to draw walks and plays quicker on the bases than his below-average speed out of the batter's box.Though he lacks classic shortstop tools, PERSON finds a way to make plays. He's not twitchy or flashy and his arm is merely average, yet his instincts and positioning help him get to balls. Many scouts believe he's more of a second baseman than a shortstop and perhaps more of a utilityman than a regular, but his quality makeup may help him exceed expectations.",-1
"GPE's pitching staff had a fair share of bumps and bruises during a 2019 season, losing Friday night starter PERSON for most of the season. ORGANIZATION also got dinged up, missing a couple of starts with arm tenderness. But the big right-hander returned in late May no worse for the wear and displayed an intriguing array of starting pitching stuff. It was enough for the ORGANIZATION to take him in the third round and give him $647,500, about $120K below pick value, to sign. The 6-foot-4 ORGANIZATION is big with arm strength to spare and has a three-pitch mix that points to a possible future in a rotation. He'll be 91-95 mph with his fastball, sitting around 93 mph more often than not. It plays up a bit with riding life and occasional sink to his armside down in the zone. He uses his solid average slider a lot, throwing it with good three-quarter angle with curveball-like depth to it. His low 80s changeup gives him a third Major League average offering, and he sells it well with good arm speed.ORGANIZATION's strike-throwing ability improved over each of his three years with the ORGANIZATION, but it's more control over command at this point. But he has the chance to get to average control, giving him the chance to be an innings-eating member of a big league rotation.",-1
"GPE's GPE baseball player of the year as both a sophomore in 2016 and a senior in '18, PERSON led PERSON to the state Division I title game in each of his four seasons and a championship in his second. He became the FACILITY's highest prep position player ever drafted when the ORGANIZATION selected him 42nd overall (supplemental first round) in June. After signing for an over-slot $2 million, he'll try to become the first hitter selected from a GPE high school to make it to the big leagues. PERSON had some of the best left-handed power potential in the 2018 Draft, with the ability to launch balls out of any part of a ballpark thanks to his quick bat and the strength and leverage in his 6-foot-4 frame. More than just a slugger, he has good feel for hitting and should be able to hit for average and power. He made an immediate impression on the ORGANIZATION with his approach, showing the ability to work counts and lay off borderline pitches against more experienced competition.PERSON played some third base and outfield in high school, and he has more athleticism than his burly build might indicate. Nevertheless, he projects strictly as a first baseman in pro ball because he lacks quickness and arm strength. He has worked diligently to get himself in shape and should provide average glovework at first base.",-1
"Players from cold-weather GPE states like ORGANIZATION Hampshire aren't supposed to be particularly advanced. There's a reason why a high school hitter from the FACILITY has never made it to the big leagues. PERSON, taken earlier than any prep position player from the state when the ORGANIZATION selected him 42nd overall in the 2018 ORGANIZATION, hopes to be the first and showed that he didn't get the memo about not being prepared for pro ball when he led the ORGANIZATION level PERSON in on-base percentage and finished third in ORGANIZATION in his summer debut.Scouts lauded PERSON's raw power as the ORGANIZATION approached, seeing his bat speed, strength and 6-foot-4 frame all pointing to future over-the-fence ability, some of which showed up during his first taste of pro ball. There's confidence he'll get to that power because of his advanced approach from the left side of the plate. He works counts, draws a ton of walks and rarely gets fooled, giving him the chance to eventually be a plus hitter with plus power. While his below-average speed does limit him to first base as a pro, he's surprisingly athletic given his size and has the chance to be a solid defender. His bat should profile at the typically run-producing spot as well, with the ORGANIZATION excited to see what he can do over a full season.",-1
"Left-hander PERSON and right-hander PERSON were supposed to be the prime prospects at PERSON in 2018, yet it was GPE who emerged as the program's top Draft prospect by hitting .370/.462/.642 with 12 home runs and 77 RBIs in 65 games. The ORGANIZATION took him in ORGANIZATION B in June, signing him for slightly below slot value ($800,000) and assigned GPE to the Class A Short-Season LOCATION for his professional debut. With GPE's simple approach and advanced feel for hitting, he makes consistent hard contact to all fields from the right side of the plate. He has significantly increased his power output as a sophomore and has enough strength and bat speed to provide 30 doubles and 15 homers per season as a pro. GPE manages the strike zone well and has solid speed on the basepaths.GPE has spent most of his college career in left field because the ORGANIZATION had a superior defender in GPE Farhat in center. Some scouts think GPE has the quickness to play center and would give him the chance to do so at the next level. PERSON tried him at shortstop in fall ball, and while his below-average arm wasn't a good fit there, he intrigues some evaluators as a possible second baseman.",-1
"ORGANIZATION's father PERSON got 14 big league at-bats but is more famous for crashing through the outfield fence at ORGANIZATION Vancouver while trying to make a catch in 1991. Grant flew under the radar as a prospect until late in the spring before his athleticism started attracting clubs. The ORGANIZATION signed him away from a ORGANIZATION State commitment for $697,500 in the third round.Though he has a big league heritage, ORGANIZATION also spent time playing football and running track in high school, so he still has plenty of room to develop. He has a smooth left-handed swing and feel for the barrel, which bode well for his hitting ability. He has the bat speed for at least average power once he put more muscle on his lanky 6-foot-2 frame.ORGANIZATION's best tool is his plus speed, which gives him the ability to steal bases and run down balls in center field. He also has solid arm strength that allows him to play anywhere in the outfield.",-1
"Following a similar path into the first round as ORGANIZATION high schooler PERSON in 2016, PERSON had his stuff and stock take a significant step forward as a senior after he improved his physical condition and added strength to his impressive frame. That progress endeared PERSON to the ORGANIZATION' scouting department, and the club selected the ORGANIZATION A&M commit with the ORGANIZATION. 11 overall pick in the 2018 Draft. He signed for $4.3 million, then logged six straight scoreless outings in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. Making the jump to full-season ball in '19, PERSON dominated for Class A Delmarva and represented the ORGANIZATION in the prestigious Futures Game in July.PERSON can run his fastball up to 96-97 mph but typically sits more in the low-to-mid 90s with heavy life. Most scouts prefer his relatively new low-80s slider, a potential plus pitch, to his mid-70s curveball, although the latter has nice shape and he repeats its release point well. PERSON didn't have much need for a changeup in high school but shows the potential to have an average one. Beyond the stuff, he's shown the ability to make swift adjustments early in his career while demonstrating advanced feel for his craft.With his 6-foot-5 frame and high-three-quarters slot, PERSON creates steep downhill plane with his pitches and already shows a propensity for getting ground balls. He's a decent athlete who uses a controlled delivery that enables him to flood the zone with quality strikes. Those qualities could help PERSON move faster than the typical high school hurler, especially if he can make strides in refining his secondary arsenal. If it all clicks, he's could become a ORGANIZATION. 2 or ORGANIZATION. 3 starter.",-1
"Like fellow GPE high schooler PERSON two years ago, PERSON improved his physical conditioning and had his stuff and stock take a significant step forward during the spring. He led ORGANIZATION (Nacogdoches) to the GPE state 3-A title as a two-way star in 2017, then consistently worked in the low 90s on the summer showcase circuit before repeatedly topping out at 97 or 98 mph as a senior. That progress endeared PERSON to the GPE, who selected the right-hander with the ORGANIZATION. 11 overall pick in the 2018 Draft. After signing for $4.3 million and forgoing a GPE A&M commitment, PERSON made his professional debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League in early July.PERSON's fastball sits at 92-94 mph with heavy life and should turn wood bats into kindling. He has an array of promising secondary pitches, with most scouts preferring his low-80s slider to his mid-70s curveball, though the latter has nice shape.

"PERSON might have gone in the first two rounds of the 2017 ORGANIZATION had he been signable away from a ORGANIZATION commitment. After playing two seasons with the GPE, he was the best sophomore-eligible prospect at a four-year college in the 2019 ORGANIZATION. He had helium as the ORGANIZATION approached, heating up down the stretch and winning the ORGANIZATION's Player of the Year and tournament ORGANIZATION awards, and became the first player in program history to be selected in the first round after the ORGANIZATION took him with the ORGANIZATION. 22 overall pick. PERSON has true top-of-the-scale speed and basestealing acumen. He creates havoc when he gets on base and did a better job of doing so in 2019, making more consistent contact while posting one of the higher walk rates in ORGANIZATION Division I. A switch-hitter with some bat speed and strength, he shows average raw power from both sides of the plate during batting practice but has yet to translate it into home run production.Though PERSON has solid arm strength to go with his blazing speed, there's skepticism about his ability to remain at shortstop. He doesn't react as quickly as expected at short and doesn't throw well from different angles. Many scouts project him to wind up in center field, where his tools would fit well.",-1
"If it seems like there are a lot of members of former big leaguer PERSON's family in pro ball, you're not wrong. His son, PERSON, just signed last July with the ORGANIZATION. His nephew PERSON is a prospect in the D-backs' system. A second nephew, PERSON, pitches in the ORGANIZATION organization, and now his younger brother, GPE, is a part of that system, too.The ORGANIZATION gave PERSON $1.5 million at the start of last July's signing period to sign out of the ORGANIZATION because of his all-around skills. At the plate, he reminds some of ORGANIZATION prospect PERSON. PERSON has plus bat speed and the ball really jumps off his bat. There is some raw power to tap into as he matures. Right now, PERSON can play shortstop, with fluid actions and a strong arm.Even if the 17-year old outgrows the position and has to move to third, PERSON's bat has the chance to profile well there. It should be exciting to watch him and PERSON, the ORGANIZATION' other big international signee last July, develop together.",-1
"The PERSON family was well represented on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list heading into the 2015 signing period. PERSON Jr. was No. 7 overall and is now one of the top prospects in all of baseball. His cousin, GPE, was ranked No. 21 on that list and received $1.5 million from the ORGANIZATION to sign. While PERSON has moved quickly, GPE has been slower to develop and is still more about projection than performance, with that being slowed even more by a shoulder injury that kept him off the field in 2018.The ORGANIZATION are still high on PERSON's all-around tool package, with the understanding that after a summer in the ORGANIZATION and a summer in the ORGANIZATION, he's still very far away. On any given day, you can see the bat speed and physicality developing, with the chance for him to be a solid hitter with PERSON average power, though that hasn't shown up in games yet. While he has a strong arm and decent defensive actions, he's not going to play shortstop, the position he was signed at, long-term. He's already seen considerable time at second and could eventually find a home at third, given his below-average speed and strong, physical build.Before figuring all that out, PERSON is going to have to start showing he can turn those tools into production. The good news is he's just 19 years old for all of 2018, with plenty of time for it to start clicking.",-1
"PERSON's cousin is PERSON phenom PERSON Jr. -- his uncle is likely future Hall of ORGANIZATION Sr. -- but this PERSON certainly has the chance to make a name for himself.

He has plus bat speed and gets the barrel of the bat through the zone extremely well. While in-game power didn't show up last summer, it's in there, with the chance to have PERSON average pop eventually. While PERSON is a below-average runner, he actually has decent actions defensively at shortstop to go along with a plus arm. That said, most see him outgrowing the position -- not to mention the depth at that position above him in the system -- and needing to move to third, where he did see some action in the ORGANIZATION during his debut. He also split time between short and second during his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2017.PERSON has all the tools to be an everyday player, regardless of where on the left side of the infield he calls home long term.

"Though PERSON played a role in the ORGANIZATION Sox winning the 2018 World Series, the ORGANIZATION have no regrets about trading him in July 2017. In return, they received a pair of right-handers who could team up in their rotation of the future in GPE PERSON and GPE. Signed for $275,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2015, he made a successful jump to full-season ball this year but has been bothered by persistent shoulder problems.GPE' fastball velocity continues to climb as he matures physically, and he sat at 92-96 mph and touched 98 as an 18-year-old in 2018. His heater comes with heavy sink that makes it difficult to lift, as evidenced by his outstanding home run rate (0.4 per nine innings) and groundout/airout ratio (2.4) in his first three pro seasons. His 82-85 mph slider lacks consistency but shows flashes of becoming a plus offering.GPE shows some feel for his changeup but it still needs a lot of work to keep left-handers from teeing off on him. His control is improving but his command has a long ways to go. Youth is still very much on his side and PERSON will be patient with his development.",-1

He demonstrates good aptitude for spinning a curveball that shows signs of becoming a plus pitch. His changeup isn't as advanced but he shows some feel for what should be at least an average third offering.PERSON does a good job of using his 6-foot-2 frame to create downhill plane, resulting in a 2.4 groundout/flyout ratio in his first two years as a pro. Though his control and command still require a lot of development, the ORGANIZATION like how he works with a quick tempo and think he'll figure it out.

He primarily played second base in 2016, where his athleticism, range and arm are all clean fits, though he's returned to the outfield on a full-time basis in '17.",-1
"A three-year starter at ORGANIZATION, PERSON formed a formidable 1-2 punch with PERSON in the ORGANIZATION lineup. PERSON went No. 3 overall in the 2018 Draft, but because PERSON wasn't able to carry over his Cape Cod League MVP performance and turned in a bit of an uneven junior season, he ended up being available for the ORGANIZATION to select in the second round. He did hit his way up to the Class A Advanced PERSON in his pro debut.Big and physical at 6-foot-4, PERSON is surprisingly athletic and shows more tools than you might think upon first glance. In college and during most of his pro debut, PERSON showed the ability to consistently barrel up the baseball with a largely line-drive-oriented approach and swing path, while limiting strikeouts and drawing some walks. There's a lot of raw power in his left-handed swing that he hasn't always tapped into, and it could be plus when all is said and done if he can hit enough to get to it.PERSON played first and right field at ORGANIZATION and showed he could do a capable job in center field in the Cape. He'll likely stick at an outfield corner, where he played during his debut, as a pro, but there is pressure on that power bat to progress.",-1
"After a strong performance in his second summer playing in the ORGANIZATION League that earned him ORGANIZATION honors in 2017, PERSON looked like he would join PERSON teammate PERSON as a first-round pick. PERSON went No. 3 overall to the ORGANIZATION, but an inconsistent junior season knocked PERSON down to the second round. He turned out to be the highest player signed by the ORGANIZATION, as first-rounder PERSON did not come to terms with the club, getting $1.2 million to join the organization.PERSON does have one of the best combinations of physicality and athleticism among the college hitters in the 2018 Draft class. He has excellent hand-eye coordination that helps him barrel up the ball, though he did struggle with breaking stuff. He has more of a line-drive approach at the plate, but given his size and strength, there's plenty of raw power for him to tap into as he develops as a hitter. He'll take walks and work counts. Though he's 6-foot-4, 220 pounds, he's an above-average runner and even showed he can play a capable center field in the Cape.He's likely a corner outfielder in the future, and he played first and right in college. To begin his career, the ORGANIZATION sent him to full-season ball, where he almost exclusively played right field.",-1
"The son of PERSON, a two-time All-Star who won two World Series in a 17-year big league career, PERSON erupted to hit a circuit-best nine homers in the ORGANIZATION and then added 18 more as a Duke junior in 2018, albeit while hitting for less than average. PERSON's power transferred immediately in his pro debut, as he homered seven times in 57 games in the Class A Short PERSON after signing with ORGANIZATION for $1.35 million as the club's second-round pick. However, PERSON's development will be on hold for the first 50 games of 2019 after he tested positive in November for Ritalin.PERSON had a rough first half as a junior but rallied later in the spring to cement his status as one of the better power hitters his class. He's capable of driving the ball out of the park to all fields by using a combination of bat speed, physical strength and loft he generates with his left-handed swing. Concerns about PERSON's propensity to swing and miss in college were only exacerbated during his pro debut, as he showed very little selectivity while trying to hit the ball out of the park with every swing. With his below-average speed, plus raw power and plus arm strength -- he recorded 10 outfield assists in the LOCATION -- PERSON has prototypical tools for right field.",-1
"PERSON GSP appeared in two All-Star Games and won two World Series in a 17-year big league career after signing as a 58th-round pick. His son, PERSON, didn't have to wait nearly as long to hear his name called in June, when the ORGANIZATION selected the ORGANIZATION outfielder in the second round and signed him for slot value at $1.35 million. After playing sparingly and going homerless as a freshman in 2016, GSP broke out with 13 home runs last spring and led the ORGANIZATION with nine last summer, when scouts named him the prestigious college circuit's top prospect. He upped that total to 18 home runs as a junior, albeit while hitting for less average.GSP had a rough first half as a junior but rallied later in the spring and showed that he's still one of the better power hitters available in the 2018 Draft, capable of driving the ball out to all fields thanks to his bat speed and the loft he generates with his left-handed swing. There already were concerns about his propensity to swing and miss, however, and they were exacerbated during the spring as he has tried to lift nearly every pitch he saw out of the park.With his power potential and solid arm strength, GSP fits the right-field profile. He can flash average run times but hasn't showed that kind of speed this spring. Even with modest quickness, he's a sound defender on the outfield corners.",-1
"PERSON was pitching for PERSON of the ORGANIZATION when the ORGANIZATION purchased his contract in July 2014. His immediate success in the ORGANIZATION convinced the club he was ready to move PERSON, and he finished his 2015 pro debut with four impressive outings in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. He looked even better when he returned to the ORGANIZATION this year, and ORGANIZATION traded him to the ORGANIZATION at the deadline for PERSON Feldman.PERSON is a converted outfielder who has yet to grow into his highly projectable frame. The right-hander is polished for his age and has present pitchability, showing the ability to throw all three of his pitches for strikes. He can hit 91 mph with his fastball but usually sits in the upper 80s, and he has advanced feel for a changeup that some scouts already deem an above-average pitch. He has some feel for spinning a breaking ball, but it's well behind his two other offerings. At 6-foot-2 and 150 pounds, PERSON will need to get stronger, both to add more power to his stuff and to be able to handle the rigors of a full pro season. Assuming that happens, his advanced pitchability would give him a ceiling of a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"Though PERSON was named the ORGANIZATION Independent PERSON boys basketball player of the year for 2018-19 after averaging 17 points and 11 rebounds per game for PERSON (PERSON, Ala.), he has a considerably brighter future on the diamond. Rated as a potential top-three-rounds pick entering 2019, he boosted his stock and showed more strength and quickness as a senior en route to PERSON player of the year honors. The ORGANIZATION took him with the first pick in the second round of the GPE, following their selection of PERSON with the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick, then lured him away from an GPE commitment with an above-slot bonus.One of the better prep hitters in his GPE class, PERSON produces a lot of hard contact from gap to gap. He shows more bat speed from the left side of the plate as well as power that's started to catch up to his hitting ability as he continues to add muscle to his 6-foot-3 frame. He has been a little faster this year as well, more consistently recording above-average run times.There's still some debate as to where PERSON will wind up defensively. Those who think he can remain at shortstop believe he's an underrated athlete with a quick first step and a plus arm. Others believe he'll slow down as he fills out and necessitate a move to third base, where he'd still profile well offensively.",-1
"PERSON spent three years pitching at ORGANIZATION II ORGANIZATION University in GPE, a six-foot right-hander who put up video game numbers (1.04 ERA, .163 batting average against) as a junior. The A's went a bit over the $100,000 threshold for picks after the 10th round, signing him for $125K in the 14th round of last June's Draft. PERSON then pitched his way to full-season ball in his relatively brief pro debut. He tried to work past an elbow issue and had gone to the GPE League before being shut down in early July after just five outings with a ORGANIZATION strain.PERSON cranked his fastball up to 95-96 mph at times at ORGANIZATION, but largely pitched at 92 mph during his summer debut in the A's organization. He can fill up the strike zone with his heater and get swings and misses with it. He also misses bats with his slider, while he also was able to use the breaking ball and his changeup to get some ground-ball outs. While he has an up-tempo delivery, he's always been a strike-thrower and continued that trend in his first taste of pro ball.He'll need to find a way to attack left-handed hitters, who hit him a bit better last summer, albeit in a small sample size, and refinement of the changeup could do that. He's reminded some of PERSON in terms of his aggressive demeanor on the mound and body type (though not in pure stuff), with a realistic ceiling as a back-end starter and a life as a reliever more likely.",-1
"Known since starring in the 2011 Little League World Series, PERSON was one of the better legitimate two-way players in the 2017 Draft class -- so much so that the scouting industry remained split down the middle all spring on whether he'd be better suited on the mound or behind the plate at the next level. The ORGANIZATION preferred PERSON in the latter role, drafting him in the second round and then signing him for close to $500,000 above slot value. PERSON has the chance to be a special catcher. He has good hands and a plus arm defensively -- he was up to 94-95 mph on the mound -- and while he's a below-average runner, his athleticism helps him move well behind the dish. He swings the bat well from a crouch set up, with quiet pop that could end up being average power in the future. The one thing scouts agree on is that PERSON's grades will improve once he starts to focus on one craft. But even as the spring unfolded, there was division among scouts whether he should stay on the mound or behind the plate at the next level. At the worst, PERSON's power arm represents an interesting fallback option should he have trouble sticking as a catcher.",-1
"Few pitchers in the 2017 high school class could match ORGANIZATION's combination of stuff and track record of performance against top competition, but his volatile delivery and mound antics created enough concern that he lasted 66 picks in the GPE. Since the ORGANIZATION gladly pounced on him in the second round and signed him for an over-slot $1.45 million, he has been their best pitching prospect. He has pitched through bone spurs while making the jump to full-season ball in 2019 and plans to have surgery in the offseason.A true power pitcher, ORGANIZATION blows away hitters with a fastball that parks in the mid-90s and repeatedly hits 99 mph with riding life that makes it even more difficult to barrel. He backs it up with a wipeout slider with mid-80s velocity and two-plane depth, and he shows the aptitude to manipulate it into a true curveball to give batters a different look. His changeup can be too firm at times but shows flashes of becoming an average third offering with some fade.ORGANIZATION has a lot going on in his violent delivery, which finishes with some disconcerting head whack, yet he repeats it and keeps it in sync enough to find the strike zone on a regular basis. He's more animated than most pitchers, and he'll throw in a PERSON shimmy or groom the mound like PERSON at times. Though some scouts wonder if he can hold up as a starter, the ORGANIZATION are determined to develop him as one and believe he can become their ace of the future.",-1
"ORGANIZATION has a long history of excelling against top competition, including winning the gold-medal game for PERSON at the 18-and-under PERSON in GPE last October with 11 strikeouts in seven one-hit innings. He starred at the ORGANIZATION in GPE, hitting 97 mph and outdueling future Reds third-rounder PERSON. ORGANIZATION went a round earlier in June, signing for an over-slot $1.45 million.ORGANIZATION had one of the best fastballs among high schoolers in the 2017 Draft. He led all NHSI pitchers by averaging 94.4 mph with his heater, which can climb as high as 98 with riding life. There's power to his breaking ball as well, which can be a plus curveball at its best but devolves into a slider at times, while his changeup is a work in progress.Extremely animated on the mound, ORGANIZATION features a lot of effort in his delivery and doesn't always repeat his mechanics. He does a decent job of throwing strikes but may not have more than average command, and some evaluators believe his approach eventually will land him in the bullpen. He'll have closer upside if that happens, though the ORGANIZATION have every intention of developing him as a starter.",-1
"ORGANIZATION won the gold-medal game at the 18-and-under PERSON with 11 strikeouts in seven one-hit innings in October 2016, then outdueled future Reds third-rounder PERSON while showcasing the hottest fastball at the ORGANIZATION Invitational last March. His stuff and his history of excelling against top competition led the ORGANIZATION to select him in the second round and sign him for an over-slot $1,450,000. He was nearly unhittable in his pro debut, recording a 41 percent strikeout rate and .109 opponent average in the Rookie-level PERSON League.ORGANIZATION has the potential for two well above-average pitches, starting with a mid-90s fastball with riding life that repeatedly topped out at 99 mph during his debut. He also flashes a wipeout slider, showing some feel to manipulate its speed and shape and turning it into a hard curveball at times. His fading changeup is a work in progress that can become an average third pitch with more velocity separation from his fastball.Though there's a lot of effort and moving parts in his delivery, ORGANIZATION repeats it well and everything comes together well enough for him to throw strikes. It may be difficult for him to have better than average command, but the ORGANIZATION are committed to developing him as a starter. He's extremely animated on the mound and has been known to groom the dirt a la PERSON or throw a shimmy into his mechanics like PERSON.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION' pursuit of PERSON during the 2013-14 international period led the club to acquire additional international pool money, which they then used to sign the then-16-year-old for $330,000 in January 2014. His rawness showed during in his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, but he made strides in his second tour of the ORGANIZATION in 2015 and then followed it up with a strong performance in instructional league. PERSON continued to move up the ladder and was pitching well in the GPE League when the ORGANIZATION dealt him to GPE for PERSON Jr. ahead of the 2016 PERSON Deadline.PERSON saw an uptick in velocity in 2015 as he continued to get stronger and grow into his projectable frame. He showed the ability to bump 94 mph with his fastball as an amateur, but was hitting 97-98 mph at times during the regular season and instructs. His slider and changeup are below-average pitches for him, though both should improve as he gains better feel for pitching.Learning how to repeat his delivery will be key for PERSON, who struggles to keep his body and lightning-quick arm in sync. The right-hander's arm strength offers plenty to dream on, but he'll have to check countless developmental boxes before being deemed ready for the big leagues.",-1
" Back in 2014, the ORGANIZATION signed shortstop PERSON for $8 million, a bonus so steep it put the club way over the international spending limit and kept them from spending more than $300,000 on any international free agent for the following two years. That didn't mean they couldn't find talent, as they signed ORGANIZATION as a 16-year-old in August 2015 for just $80,000. The 5-foot-11 southpaw has seen his velocity creep up since he signed and he now averages 92 mph with his heater and can reach back and touch 96 mph on occasion. He can miss bats with a curve that has outstanding depth and should be a reliable above-average breaking ball in the future. He shows some feel for a changeup that could be close to average when all is said and done. The biggest thing holding the 20-year-old, who made his full season debut in 2019, back is his command. He'll need to find the strike zone more consistently in order to advance and have any chance of starting. The bullpen could be in his future, where that fastball-curve combination could play up in shorter stints.",-1
"The 2016-17 international signing period was highlighted by high-priced prospects like PERSON, who got $26 million to sign with the FACILITY, and GPE, who signed with the ORGANIZATION for $11 million. The ORGANIZATION only handed out one seven-figure bonus that signing period, to outfielder PERSON, but it might be PERSON, with just a $77,000 bonus to sign in August 2016, who might end up being the best international prospect signed by the organization at that time.The 6-foot-2 left-hander already looks the part with an ideal pitcher's frame, and there's more growth to come. That means there's likely more velocity coming on a fastball that already sits in the 92-96 mph range. Both his curveball and changeup are average offerings now, but there's upside on those pitches as well. He'll show glimpses of plus action on both, but presently they are inconsistent, something the ORGANIZATION are confident will change with experience and innings.Like with many young pitchers, PERSON does struggle with command and control, though he took a nice step forward in that regard in 2019 while pitching his way from the ORGANIZATION, where he had spent parts of three summers, to his GPE debut in the rookie-level PERSON. The ORGANIZATION love how fearless he is and how he is getting more aggressive in the strike zone, with a future as a big league starter seeming more realistic the more he takes the mound.",-1

With his impressive bat speed and strength, he generates tremendous raw power from the right side of the plate. He's at least a plus runner and some evaluators grade him quicker than that, and he should become a solid defender with the arm strength to match.To reach his upside, PERSON will need to add polish in all phases of the game. He'll have to develop a more consistent approach to fully tap into his power. He'll also have to refine his reads and routes to remain in center field, though he should be able to fit the offensive profile if he has to slide to a corner.",-1

He signed for $325,000 and reported to short-season Tri-City.PERSON topped out at 91 mph with his fastball as a freshman, at 93 mph as a sophomore, at 95 mph on PERSON's scout day last fall and at 98 mph last spring. During his junior season, he showed the ability to pitch at 96-98 mph for three innings at a time and to work consistently at 92-96 deep into games. His heater stands out more for the downhill plane that comes from his high-three-quarters arm slot than its life, though he'll throw a two-seamer with some sink in the low 90s.PERSON's slider also improved in college and shows flashes of becoming a plus offering in the mid-80s with bite and depth. His changeup is more of a work in progress and will need more separation in velocity from his fastball. There's not much effort in his delivery, but he sometime struggles to repeat his mechanics and will need better control to remain a starter.",-1
" A two-way talent who would have been a first-round pick as an infielder, PERSON went No. 2 overall to the ORGANIZATION in the 2017 Draft and received a bonus pool-era record bonus of $7.23 million because of his arm. The ORGANIZATION allowed him to DH during his pro debut as he readied himself on the mound. After pitching briefly in the Rookie-level PERSON, PERSON is now a full-time pitcher, one who lit up the radar gun at the ORGANIZATION in his first full season, but was shut down in early August for the season with an elbow strain.Putting all of his focus on the mound will increase the chances of PERSON reaching his incredibly high ceiling. The 6-foot-4 teenager has incredibly easy velocity, cranking his fastball up to triple digits without too much effort. He'll consistently reach 97-101 mph with a clean and repeatable delivery and he commands the pitch fairly well. He shows glimpses of a plus slider, something that should become more consistent as he focuses on one breaking ball. He's shown a good feel for a changeup and while he didn't throw it much in high school, it could eventually be a third at least above-average offering. The athleticism PERSON showed as a shortstop will only help him on the mound in terms of fielding his position and repeating his mechanics. It may take a while for him to refine his secondary stuff, but since he'll be just 18 for most of the 2018 season, there's no reason for the ORGANIZATION to push him too fast.",-1
" Rated as the top overall talent in the 2017 GPE class throughout the spring, GPE was a contender to go No. 1 overall to the Twins but ended up landing in the second spot. The talented two-way player, who would have been a first-round pick as an infielder, was taken for his ability on the mound and given an above-pick value bonus of $7.23 million, a record for the bonus pool era. Though GPE was shut down in April to protect his arm, he showed plenty of talent over the summer showcase circuit and especially at the start of his senior season, when he was touching 101-102 mph early in the spring. He can throw his fastball in the 97-101 mph range and then will settle into the 95-98 mph range, doing so without too much effort. He will throw two breaking balls which will run into each other occasionally. Some feel focusing on a slider in the future will be best, and while there are scouts who worry about his feel to spin the ball, most believe the pitch will be at least PERSON average. He didn't need his changeup much in high school, but he showed the ability to mix in some effective ones at times. GPE commands the ball better than one would expect from a young fireballer, rarely hurting himself with walks. The ORGANIZATION were going to allow GPE to keep swinging the bat, at least during his first summer of pro experience, as he builds himself back up on the mound after not throwing a competitive pitch for so long. With his premium power stuff and the athleticism he brings to the mound from shortstop, GPE has as much ceiling as any player in his GPE class.",-1
"â¢ 4/2: GPE has PERSON, out for ORGANIZATION, who was the ORGANIZATION. 2 overall selection by the Reds in the 2017 Draft and received a bonus pool-era record $7.23 million because of his power arm, is being watched closely after he suffered an injury during his first full season in the ORGANIZATION. A right elbow strain that shut him down for the year in late July was cause for concern, but was initially determined not to require surgery. He passed early incremental tests during rehabilitation, but suffered a setback in late March and it was announced he needed PERSON surgery at the beginning of April.The start of GPE's first full professional season had its ups and downs, as the right-hander endured many rough outings and lackluster pitching lines at the start of the year. But with a repeatable delivery and easy velocity that reaches 97-102 mph, he started finding his groove as the year went on and was very impressive during his ORGANIZATION stint. While his fastball lights up radar guns, it often lacks life. The pitch has good finish when he keeps it down, but it straightens when GPE elevates it, making it more hittable above the knees. His secondary pitches remain works in progress, with a slider that flashes plus and a changeup, while still in the embryonic stage, that has the makings of being a solid third offering. He showed improved command and control as his first season wore on.Off the field, GPE is polished, gracious and has the poise to help him become a star in the game if he continues to develop once he returns to action. He has the chance to pitch at, or near, the top of a rotation.",-1
"Players taken No. 3 overall have gone on to accomplish great things in baseball, from ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION and PERSON to All-Star arms like PERSON and PERSON. The ORGANIZATION took PERSON in that spot back in 1988; PERSON was the choice in 2016 and if his progress as a pro, including finishing second in the system in ORGANIZATION and third in strikeouts in 2018, is any indication, he's not far from joining his predecessors.PERSON has made strides in using his outstanding three-pitch mix more effectively, starting with a fastball he can run up to 96 mph. He throws downhill and has struck out more than 10 batters per nine innings while also generating a good amount of groundball outs. His curve remains an out pitch and his changeup, which he's worked on tirelessly, also is a plus pitch at times. In 2018, he showed an ability to pitch to all quadrants and set up hitters with all three offerings.PERSON's walk rate improved in 2018, but he still needs to refine his overall command. Because of his repeatable delivery and understanding of how to pitch, the ORGANIZATION are confident he'll have average control, which should allow him to reach his potential as a frontline type starter.",-1
"Ranked No. 13 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 200 GPE prospects list as the 2016 GPE approached, PERSON's name started popping up in the top of the GPE conversations late in the days before the GPE began. The upstate GPE prep standout was taken No. 3 overall, signing for $4 million. That was more than $2.5 million below pick value, allowing the ORGANIZATION to aggressively go after other high-ceiling talent later in the GPE. Tall and projectable with the ability to add strength, PERSON throws his fastball in the 91-95 mph range with good downhill angle. His breaking ball can be plus at times, getting swings and misses. It has slurve action at this point, but could tighten up and become a true slider in time. PERSON has good feel for an average changeup as well. He's generally around the strike zone and attacks hitters.While PERSON might have been taken No. 3 overall in a money-saving deal, he has a tremendous amount of upside and could eventually develop into a frontline-type starter at the big league level.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION continued their hoarding of high school arms when they selected PERSON from the ORGANIZATION high school ranks with the ORGANIZATION. 3 overall pick in the 2016 Draft. As they have with previous prep arms, the ORGANIZATION sent PERSON to full-season Rome for his first full professional year, and he was up for the challenge, pitching extremely well while under fairly tight usage restrictions.PERSON already shows the makings of three pitches that have the chance to be above-average to plus, along with a willingness to work tirelessly on his craft. He'll throw his fastball in the 92-96 mph range and will sit consistently around 93-94 mph. Tall and projectable, he throws with excellent downhill angle, showing the ability to both miss bats and generate weak contact on the ground. He gets swings and misses with a curve that can be plus at times. PERSON's greatest leap forward came with his changeup. He worked hard on the offspeed pitch last offseason and it showed, as it was a plus pitch for him on occasion. While his walk rate was high during his first full season, there aren't overarching concerns about his command.The gloves could come off a bit for PERSON in 2018, though with the depth in the system, there's no reason to rush him. There's still plenty of upside for PERSON to reach and he eventually could develop into a front-half-of-the-rotation kind of starter.",-1
"In 2014, the best player from GPE was pitcher PERSON. He landed in the first round, going to the ORGANIZATION. A year later, PERSON was the best player from the state. He didn't quite reach PERSON status, but he was the top GPE taken, going in the fifth round in the 2015 Draft. His bonus was re-worked when there were some concerns about his elbow, though his strong, albeit brief, pro debut helped allay any worries.PERSON really opened some eyes during that debut, showing an advanced feel for pitching, especially for a kid from GPE. He has an ability to throw all of his pitches for strikes. His fastball was in the 92-95 mph range, thrown with good action. He showed a solid power breaking ball and while his changeup is fringy, he has a feel for it and it should improve in time. PERSON isn't the prototypical tall and projectable high school right-hander, but he's strong and athletic, which helps him repeat his delivery well.PERSON was better than anticipated during his debut. His stuff and feel for pitching have the ORGANIZATION excited to see what comes next, though they had to wait as it took him a while to recover from a lingering oblique injury that forced him to miss PERSON.",-1
" A year ago, PERSON was a high school pitcher from GPE who ended up going in the first round of the GPE. PERSON didn't do quite as well, but the ORGANIZATION liked him to select and sign him in the fifth round of the 2015 GPE.Early in the spring PERSON opened eyes by firing fastballs up to 96-97 mph. He's shown the ability to sit in the 93-94 mph range with good movement, though his overall stuff has been a bit inconsistent. He flashes a solid slider at times, and like with many young pitchers, his changeup is a work in progress, though he shows some feel for it. He's generally around the plate, though his overall command needs to be refined. PERSON isn't the biggest guy in the world, but he's strong and athletic, leaving little concern about durability.",-1
"As a high school senior last spring, PERSON intrigued scouts with his projectability and pitchability but also worried them with his inconsistent velocity and desire for second-round money. The ORGANIZATION chose him in the 11th round, had ORGANIZATION PERSON call him with the news and eventually landed him for $650,000, the equivalent of a third-round bonus.PERSON's fastball sat at 88-90 mph for much of his senior season, spiking up 91-93 in some starts and occasionally touching 94, and his velocity tended to dip after a couple of innings. His 6-foot-4 build is so projectable and his arm works so well in his fluid delivery that he should emerge with a consistent plus fastball once he gets stronger. His fastball also features some run and sink.PERSON shows promise as well with his secondary pitches, a curveball that should become more effective once it adds more power and a changeup with some fade. He's a good athlete, so he shouldn't have any problems repeating his mechanics and refining his control and command. He also earns praise for his competitive makeup and isn't afraid to pitch inside.",-1
"PERSON is fairly new to pitching after focusing more on golf before getting on the mound as a high school junior. He confounded scouts as a senior in 2015, intriguing them with his projectability and pitchability but worrying them with inconsistent velocity and questionable signability. The ORGANIZATION gambled on him in the 11th round, had ORGANIZATION call to welcome him to the organization and inked him for $650,000, the equivalent of third-round money.Los PERSON is handling PERSON carefully because he's inexperienced and his lanky frame is still growing. After working with an 88-90 mph fastball for much of his senior year, PERSON now pitches at 92-94 with some run and sink and should gain more velocity as he matures physically. He pairs his heater with an advanced changeup that fades at the plate.PERSON's curveball is more of a work in progress, and the ORGANIZATION hope it will take off after he experimented with different grips during instructional league. He has good athleticism and body control for a big pitcher, so he repeats his delivery well and fills the strike zone. A tough competitor, he relishes pitching inside.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION' signing of PERSON flew under the radar, as they inked the GPE shortstop for just $60,000 in October 2014. He's since impressed club officials with his athleticism, tools and advanced feel for the game at a young age, and he fared well on both sides of the ball last season in the ORGANIZATION before finishing the year with PERSON. PERSON's defense currently is well ahead of his hitting, but evaluators expect the latter to catch up as he continues adding strength to his athletic and projectable frame. There's little doubt he'll be able to remain at shortstop, where he shows good range and speed as well as an above-average arm. At the plate, the right-handed hitter makes consistent contact but offers little in the way of power. Set to play all of 2017 at age 20, PERSON, who has yet to reach full-season ball, is slightly behind the developmental curve and requires considerable projection. But the ORGANIZATION like PERSON's chances of becoming a big league shortstop and believe he's poised to make strides in the coming year.",-1
"While ORGANIZATION signed in July 2015 with the ORGANIZATION out of GPE for $500,000, he jumped on a bit of a fast track when he made his pro debut at age 17 and finished that 2016 season competing in the ORGANIZATION playoffs. He was back at that full-season level in 2017 when he was sent to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION Wilson/Alex Avila trade at the ORGANIZATION. He capped things off with a very strong, albeit brief, showing in the ORGANIZATION Winter League.Few question that ORGANIZATION is going to hit. He has an advanced approach at the plate and has been described as looking ""hitterish"" in the box by some evaluators. He draws walks and doesn't strike out a ton while showing the ability to drive the ball to all fields. The combination of loft and bat speed should allow him to get close to PERSON average power, with 12-15 homers annually a realistic projection. There are more questions about where he might end up defensively long-term. He's largely played shortstop, where the ORGANIZATION will continue to let him play, but he'll also see more time at third, where his above-average arm would play, and second. Wherever he lands, the ORGANIZATION are excited to see how his advanced bat skills play as he moves up the ladder.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION have mined GPE as well as any club in the last few years. They were especially productive there in 2015, when they purchased right-hander PERSON from the ORGANIZATION for $1.5 million and ORGANIZATION from the GPE Red Devils for $800,000. Just 17 years old when he came to the GPE for his pro debut last summer, he batted .305 in the Rookie-level PERSON and earned a promotion to low Class A for the ORGANIZATION playoffs. He was spending the year at that level in 2017 when he was sent to the ORGANIZATION as part of the return for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION Deadline.ORGANIZATION has more pop than the other teenaged infield prospects he just left in the ORGANIZATION system, PERSON and PERSON, but is less likely to stay up the middle long term. He has enough loft and bat speed from the right side of the plate to develop into a 15-homer threat. He also has a good feel for hitting, already showing the ability to control the strike zone and use the whole field.ORGANIZATION has enough arm strength to play anywhere in the infield, but his fringy speed and quickness limit his range. He could shift to second base but more scouts think he's destined for third base because he figures to lose a step as he fills out.",-1
"Signed for $500,000 out of GPE in July 2015, PERSON was having a solid first full season two years later when the ORGANIZATION sent him to the ORGANIZATION at the ORGANIZATION in a deal for PERSON and PERSON. PERSON' advanced bat was on full display during his first season with the ORGANIZATION, as he garnered All-Star honors in the ORGANIZATION State League before a July promotion up to Double-A. He more than held his own in the LOCATION at age 19, slashing .321/.406/.458 over 39 games, then tied a bow on his season with a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION Winter League. PERSON' success and overall consistency at the plate reflects just how well he can swing the bat. He has preternatural feel for putting the barrel on the ball and covers the plate well, with an advanced, contact-focused approach that results in low strikeout totals. He projects to have average Major League power, and he hit a career-best 15 homers in 2018, albeit exclusively to his pull-side. PERSON mature for his age with a thicker build, PERSON is a fringey runner who could lose a step. PERSON is a reliable defender at shortstop, with good hands and a strong, above-average arm, but also modest range that might require him to move to another position. Second and third base are options, and he saw meaningful time at both in 2018, logging 45 games between the two positions on top of his primary work at shortstop (74 games). Wherever he lands, the ORGANIZATION are excited to see how his advanced bat skills play as he moves up the ladder.",-1
"PERSON, a native of the ORGANIZATION, signed with the PERSON for $310,000 in 2013 and made his professional debut in the ORGANIZATION League the next year. Despite his youth, the then-17-year-old finished tied for second in the league with seven home runs. PERSON's jump to full-season ball in 2015 started slowly, then he was derailed by a torn meniscus in his left knee in early May. Now fully healthy, he returned to the Class A GPE ORGANIZATION in 2016 and showed some of the offensive potential that made him such a highly coveted international amateur. PERSON returned to the field in late August and was fully healthy for fall instructional league, where the PERSON had him working on his strike-zone awareness, pitching recognition and a middle-of-the-field approach with encouraging results. His upside is significant, but after missing most of the 2015 season, he's many years away from the ORGANIZATION Leagues.Though not physically imposing, PERSON generates plus raw power with his bat speed. His short, compact swing gives him a chance to hit for a decent average, but he'll have to improve his pitch recognition and tone down an aggressive approach that currently results in a fair amount of swing-and-miss. Defensively, PERSON has the profile of a prototypical right fielder with his average speed and plus arm.",-1
"PERSON's college career at ORGANIZATION didn't start out on the right foot, but he got headed in the right direction at the right time. He missed nearly all of his sophomore season because of elbow soreness and bone spurs. He pitched well as a redshirt sophomore in 2018, but worries about his health, durability and signability pushed him to the 24th round. He opted to come back and had a very strong junior campaign to land him in the ORGANIZATION B.PERSON operates with a 91-95 mph fastball, reaching 98 mph at times. It plays up thanks to the steep downhill plane he creates with his 6-foot-4 frame and high-three-quarters delivery. The biggest difference from 2018 is that he now is landing his secondary pitches for strikes on a regular basis, so hitters can't just sit on his heater if he falls behind in the count. His second-best weapon is a low-80s slider that sometimes morphs into a mid-80s cutter.PERSON has scrapped a changeup he didn't trust for a mid-80s splitter that shows flashes of giving him a third solid offering. He also has an upper-70s curveball that he can get over for strikes to give batters a different look. He has a sound delivery and the ceiling of a No. 3 starter if he can maintain the improvements he has made this spring, with the chance to be the first Portugal-born player to reach the big leagues since PERSON in 1875.",-1
"GPE ORGANIZATION (PERSON, N.C.) had never produced a player selected in the GPE, but in 2015, the ORGANIZATION had two: PERSON and PERSON, who had comprised two-thirds of GPE's outfield. PERSON's speed and athleticism made him a better prospect than PERSON, and he was taken in the third round and signed by the ORGANIZATION, while PERSON went in the 26th round to the Reds but opted to go on to GPE. Despite a solid pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON struggled offensively in 2016 in the Class A Short PERSON York-Penn League and was sent to the Reds in GPE's PERSON deal.PERSON is a double-plus runner who can steal bases and run down fly balls from gap to gap as a center fielder. He has a quick bat from the right side, but he currently lacks fluidity and rhythm in his swing. PERSON has wiry strength to his frame and more pop than the typical speedster, and he impressed with his ability to drive the ball with authority to straightaway center field during his pro debut in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION.Though extremely raw at the moment, PERSON does have the chance to be a premium defender who impacts the game on both sides with his speed. Developing plate discipline and learning to recognize secondary pitches could take some time, however, after he faced little semblance of pro competition as an amateur.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION loaded up on talent during the 2016-17 international period, focusing on up-the-middle players with potentially advanced bats.

"Born in GPE, PERSON moved to the ORGANIZATION to train and caught the attention of ORGANIZATION scouts before joining the organization for $350,000 in December 2014. He made his pro debut in the GPE, in the ORGANIZATION in 2015, and has been making incremental progress in sharpening his considerable raw tools since, reaching full-season ball for the first time in 2017.PERSON was a shortstop as an amateur, but the ORGANIZATION moved him to the outfield right after he signed and he took to it immediately, with the range and instincts to stay in center and enough arm to play right, seeing time in both spots so far. He's made strides in his overall approach at the plate and could eventually be close to an average power, which will help him tap into considerable raw power, especially as he continues to add strength. PERSON has worked to be more than the pure pull hitter he was when he started, learning to use the middle of the field. The in-game power he has displayed is still to the pull side, but he should be able to drive the ball to all fields in time.There is a lot of upside potential to unlock with PERSON, who will play all of the 2018 season at age 20. He could shoot up this list with another step in the right direction this season.",-1
"When PERSON signed with PERSON for $200,000 out of GPE early in the 2016-17 international period, he had already established himself as an advanced hitter with strong performances in international events. He furthered that reputation during his professional debut by hitting .335 en route to honors as a ORGANIZATION All-Star, then raked at a .348 clip in 2018 while making his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION. And when Double-A Springfield needed a fill-in catcher at the end of the ORGANIZATION season, it was 18-year-old PERSON who got the call, and he held his own in his lone PERSON start. PERSON is an advanced hitter for his age, with a short, efficient swing and mature approach that has led evaluators to peg him as an average hitter. His swing is more conducive for driving balls into the gaps, though he could develop fringy over-the-fence pop as he adds strength and learns to leverage his swing a bit. He identifies pitches well, recognizing spin better than most teenagers, and generally does a good job controlling the strike zone. As with many teenage catchers, PERSON's bat is currently ahead of his defense. His blocking and receiving both will require some work, as will his management of the running game, but club officials believe PERSON can develop into an average defender thanks to his combination of tools, work ethic and makeup.",-1
"PERSON began his college career at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, but found himself stuck behind three infielders who could all go in the top five rounds in this year's Draft. So after his freshman season with the ORGANIZATION in 2018, he transferred to ORGANIZATION Junior College in GPE. The move paid off as the infielder put up big numbers and landed in the fourth round of the 2019 Draft. The ORGANIZATION signed him for over $100,000 below pick value, which helped them also land PERSON and PERSON Hinds.The switch-hitter showed the ability to hit for average and power in junior college and it's his bat that will carry him. He has easy power from the left side of the plate and has a good right-handed swing as well, with more gap power from that side. A shortstop in high school, PERSON moved to second base at ORGANIZATION because it had a superior defender there and, to his credit, he was willing to do whatever was needed to make the team better. He has decent hands and a solid arm and has gotten to move back to shortstop during his pro debut. His somewhat limited range might make second the best spot for him long-term, and he continued to get work there as well in his first summer of pro ball.PERSON's ceiling is as a bat-first middle infielder, one who could be a regular at second, with an outside shot at playing short. Because of his offensive toolset, he has a pretty high floor as an offensive-minded utility player who can move around the infield.",-1
"A relatively unheralded prospect from the ORGANIZATION high school ranks, PERSON wasn't selected until the 30th round of the 2018 Draft. PERSON to start his pro career rather than head to GPE, he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $50,000 and then was one of the most polished hitters in the ORGANIZATION during his pro debut, finishing in the top five in average, on-base percentage and ORGANIZATION. After hanging back in extended spring training in 2019, he earned an assignment to the full-season LOCATION League in June.PERSON has an advanced approach at the plate from the right side that belies his age (19 for all of 2019) that allowed him to walk nearly as often as he struck out during his pro debut. With a compact swing, he's shown the ability to use all fields. He'd shown mostly gap power in the ORGANIZATION, but an offseason of work has helped him grow into more over-the-fence pop and he was showing the ability to hit the ball out the other way during his full-season debut. While he did play some center field during his debut, he's settled into playing the corners, where his strong arm profiles well.Right now, PERSON looks like more of a platoon type of player, one who could see time in either corner and perhaps even spell a starter in center field. But given his age and his plus work ethic, it might be wrong to underestimate his ceiling.",-1
"PERSON entered his junior season looking like a top-two-rounds college pitcher, but his stock took a hit when he missed six weeks with a strained oblique. He was up-and-down after his return, but turned it up a notch near the end of his season at ORGANIZATION, and the D-backs saw enough to take him in the third round and give him $550,000 to sign, just a tick below pick value.At his best, PERSON displays three plus pitches, starting with a 92-94 mph fastball that reaches 97 mph and features some run and sink. Hitters have a difficult time laying off his low-80s slider, giving him a second swing-and-miss pitch. There are times when his changeup is his most effective secondary offering, sitting in the low 80s with similar action to his heater.Inconsistency plagued PERSON throughout his career and he's often struggled with command, which has led to him being more hittable than he should be given his stuff. That, plus some effort in a delivery he doesn't always repeat, lead some to believe his big league future will be out of the bullpen.",-1
"PERSON emerged this spring as the best junior college prospect since PERSON went ORGANIZATION. 1 overall out of LOCATION in 2010 and the best in GPE since PERSON was a supplemental first-rounder from GPE in 2005. After a torn hip labrum that required surgery limited him to just 15 2/3 innings as an ORGANIZATION freshman and cost him a spot on ORGANIZATION' postseason roster, PERSON transferred to GPE (GPE) for his sophomore season. He was perhaps the stingiest pitcher in all of ORGANIZATION baseball in 2019, registering a 0.87 ERA across 82 2/3 innings while striking out 134 batters and walking just 30. The ORGANIZATION were thrilled to get the big right-hander in the first round and signed him for $3.45 million, slightly below slot value for the ORGANIZATION. 17 overall pick.PERSON pitches at 94-97 mph and reaches 99 with his fastball, showing the ability to carry premium velocity into the late innings. While his heater has riding life at the top of the strike zone and sink toward the bottom, its movement isn't as consistent as its velocity. His upper-80s slider can be a wipeout pitch with depth and his low-80s curveball can be a plus offering with 12-6 break when at their best, though they aren't always reliable weapons and can play closer to average.With his huge 6-foot-8 frame, PERSON creates difficult angle on his pitches that make them even harder to hit. His biggest needs are to improve a changeup that can get too firm and flat, and to refine his control and command. He has an unusually short arm action for such a big pitcher, though it doesn't compromise his electric all-around stuff.",-1

He has some gap power but hasn't fully tapped into it because he tends to hit the ball on the ground.An average runner, PERSON has outstanding instincts that allow him to play quicker than that on the bases and in the middle of the infield. He has solid arm strength and a nose for the ball, projecting as at least an average defender at shortstop and perhaps plus at second base. ORGANIZATION officials love his constant energy and work ethic.",-1
"The son of five-time All-Star and World Series hero PERSON, PERSON got drafted two rounds earlier than his dad did out of GPE in 1988 when the ORGANIZATION made him a second-rounder in June. Part of a Chaparral High (ORGANIZATION, Ariz.) program that produced big league sluggers PERSON and PERSON, he spurned a commitment to PERSON to sign for $950,000. He made an immediate impression in pro ball, collecting 14 hits (five for extra bases) in his first five games.Gonzalez offered some of the best right-handed raw power among prepsters in the 2017 Draft. He's strong and his size gives him good leverage. He showed a more mature approach as a high school senior than he had in the past, recognizing and taking more pitches while doing a better job of using the entire field.Gonzalez has a chance to hit for average and power, and most of his value will come from his bat. While he has good hands at third base, he's a below-average runner with modest arm strength. It remains to be seen whether he'll stick at the hot corner or have to move to first base or left field.",-1
"When the ORGANIZATION made PERSON a second-round pick last June, it meant he went two rounds earlier than his father PERSON did in 1988 before becoming a five-time All-Star and a World Series hero. After passing on his commitment to PERSON to sign for a below-slot $950,000, he burst into pro ball with 14 hits in his first five games. He finished third in the Rookie-level PERSON batting race at .339 and played better defense than expected.Though PERSON had some of the best right-handed raw power among high schoolers in the 2017 Draft, he just focused on making quality contact in his debut. He showed advanced pitch-recognition skills, controlled the strike zone and used an inside-out swing to drill line drives from gap to gap. As he gets stronger and turns on more pitches, he should start producing more home runs.While PERSON is a below-average runner with modest arm strength, he does have soft hands and PERSON believes he can stay at third base if he improves his footwork and range. He has good instincts and the work ethic to get better. If he has to move, he still might produce enough offensively to profile at first base or in left field.",-1
"An uneven senior year for his GPE high school sparked a slide in PERSON's ORGANIZATION stock, but the ORGANIZATION were thrilled to get him in the third round of the 2017 ORGANIZATION. They gave him second-round money to sign him away from his ORGANIZATION of GPE commitment. The big left-hander has had trouble gaining traction in his first two summers as a pro, spending both at the ORGANIZATION level, then landing on the injured list with a shoulder issue after just four starts in his full-season debut in 2019.A big, strong-bodied kid, PERSON brings a four-pitch mix led by a fastball that can consistently sit in the 93-95 mph range but can also change speeds well enough to be thrown in the high 80s and low 90s. He has a pair of breaking balls, and at their best, the slider is ahead of the curve. But they often run together, and he might eventually focus on one. The biggest issue for this southpaw so far has been command and control. He has struggled to find the strike zone consistently and had a 9.3 BB/9 ratio in the GPE League last summer. Based on pure stuff, he could be higher on the prospects list, and there's plenty of time for him to harness the talent he has.",-1
" PERSON entered the spring with the potential to be the top high school left-hander in the 2017 Draft class, particularly after a strong summer showcase circuit. He wasn't as sharp during his senior season in GPE, particularly with his secondary stuff and command, forcing his stock to slide a bit. That worked to the ORGANIZATION' advantage as they were able to nab him in the third round then give him an above-pick value bonus of just over $1 million to sign him away from his ORGANIZATION of GPE commitment. When he's at his best, PERSON will sit at 90-93 mph and touch 95 with his fastball, which plays above its velocity when he locates it well and is willing to work inside with it. He has shown the potential for three solid secondary pitches in the past, though they were more average this past spring. His sharp curveball and short slider have tended to blend together, and he hasn't used his changeup as often. PERSON has a strong frame and the athleticism to repeat his delivery, though his control was more erratic than it had been in the past. There is some upside here, however, and the ORGANIZATION could end up boasting about getting a first-round talent in the third round as a result of his uneven spring performance.",-1
"In 2016, PERSON was the top high school lefty in the ORGANIZATION class, hailing from the PERSON prep ranks. After a strong summer showcase circuit performance, it looked like PERSON might follow suit from the Heart of GPE. An uneven senior year made his ORGANIZATION stock slide, and the ORGANIZATION were thrilled to get him in the third round and gave him second-round money to sign him away from his ORGANIZATION of PERSON commitment.In many ways, PERSON has more of a college lefty profile, with an interesting mix of pitches and a feel for all of them, albeit without a ton of projection. He'll get up to 95 mph with his fastball, throwing it anywhere in the 90-95 mph range. He still throws both a curve and a slider, but they have a tendency to run into each other and there's a chance the ORGANIZATION will work with him to pick on one to commit to over the other, at least for the time being. He has a feel for his changeup and a good feel for the importance of changing speeds.PERSON struggled with his command in his last year of high school, but he projects to having solid control at this level. He'll need to keep the ball down in the zone, as he did during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, in order to keep having success as a starter.",-1
"In recent drafts, the ORGANIZATION had targeted young, athletic outfielders in the early rounds. PERSON, who was PERSON's ORGANIZATION state player of the year in 2017, fits that description and was taken in the third round, given an above-pick value bonus of $1 million to forego his ORGANIZATION commitment. After struggling a bit in his pro debut, he was sent to the PERSON for international bonus pool money, used to help bring PERSON to Anaheim.The PERSON liked PERSON in the GPE, but the ORGANIZATION got to him first, so they're happy to have his athleticism and offensive potential in the fold. There's a power-speed mix to tap into, with 20-20 potential if everything clicks. A left-handed hitter, PERSON utilizes a simple approach with good bat speed and an ability to backspin the ball when he's locked in, pointing to hitting for average and power. He's a plus runner who should be able to steal some bases and cover ground in the outfield. While he played center field in high school, he played left during his pro debut, as his well below-average arm, which is still coming back from labrum surgery after his sophomore year of high school, might be better suited for that corner.Moving to the corner might put more pressure on him to produce offensively, but he has the potential to profile well there.",-1
"PERSON was PERSON's ORGANIZATION state player of the year in 2017 and helped his LOCATION High School team get to the class 5-A championship game. To top it all off, he was selected 85th overall by the ORGANIZATION, who gave him $1 million, above pick value, to sign him away from attending ORGANIZATION. He was then sent to the ORGANIZATION in December for $1 million in international bonus pool money as the ORGANIZATION became big players on the international market.PERSON has an intriguing power-speed mix he will bring to the ORGANIZATION organization. After performing well against top pitching on the summer showcase circuit, he kept it going during his senior year, though his introduction to pro ball didn't go as smoothly. The left-handed hitter has a simple approach at the plate with a ton of bat speed and a feel for backspinning the ball, pointing to solid power at the next level. He's also a plus runner, with the potential to be a 20-20 type offensive performer if it all clicks for him.PERSON's main negative is his below-average arm, which he is still strengthening following labrum surgery as a sophomore. A center fielder in high school, he saw more time in left field during his rocky pro debut. That's likely his long-term home, putting a bit more pressure on his bat.",-1
"PERSON was a reliever only in his three years at ORGANIZATION, and each year he got better while taking on more responsibility. He took a nice step forward as a sophomore setup man, then was absolutely dominant during an All-Star Cape Cod League performance, where he didn't give up a run over 12 appearances. He used that as a springboard to become one of the best college closers in the nation and make a run at the school's single-season saves record. That landed him in third round with the ORGANIZATION, where he signed for full pick value ($581,600), then kept on saving games during his pro debut in the short-season LOCATION League.PERSON is the prototypical power short reliever and his stuff should continue to play at the pro level. He'll throw both a two-seam and four-seam fastball, the former thrown 92-94 mph with good sink and the latter sitting 95-98 mph consistently. He does have a tendency to rush to the plate, which forces him to get on the side of his slider. Once he learns to stay back consistently and stay on top of the hard breaking ball, it should be a plus out pitch for him.The right-hander did struggle with finding the strike zone in the past, but has lowered his walk rate each year and went right after hitters in his junior season and summer pro debut. College closers don't always have the opportunity to rack up saves once they enter the pro game, but PERSON has the chance to pitch late in games in a big league bullpen in the future.",-1
"There have been countless two-sport stars who turn their focus to baseball at the professional level, with mixed results, as pure athleticism doesn't always translate to the diamond. When a player combines those kinds of raw tools with a high baseball IQ, there's a chance for something special to happen. That's what the GPE think they have in PERSON.A wide receiver in high school with a father and brother who played in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON has legit athleticism, and he's already learned how to use it consistently on the baseball field. His plus speed is an asset on the basepaths, with basestealing ability. He showed aptitude in center field, but the GPE moved him to second base just prior to the start of the 2018 season, a position he played in high school. At the plate, PERSON has a quick swing generated for contact -- he reeled off a 25-game hitting streak in the GPE League in 2017 -- while continuing to tap into his considerable raw power more consistently. He gets extremely high marks for his work ethic and makeup, both on and off the field.His intangibles give PERSON a very high floor. His tools and athleticism give him a very high ceiling. He's poised to impact the upper levels of the GPE system and could be ready to join another toolsy homegrown player, PERSON, in GPE soon.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION haven't produced an impact type talent internally since PERSON made his way to GPE. While it would be completely unfair to compare PERSON to the perennial ORGANIZATION candidate, the organization is nearly as excited about the 2015 second-round pick's future as they were about their 2009 first-rounder.PERSON' game has vastly improved across the board since he began his pro career. He comes from a football background as a receiver in high school -- his father played in the ORGANIZATION as did one brother, with a second brother playing collegiately -- and he has quickly translated his plus athleticism to performance on the diamond. His baseball IQ is off the charts on both sides of the ball. He'll use a refined up-the-middle approach and he's already starting to grow into his power, showing the ability to backspin balls into the right-center field gap. His plus speed is an asset and he maximizes it by being a smart baserunner and by improving his reads and routes in center field, where he has the potential to stay long term.Obviously, he might have to move in deference to that Trout fellow, but he has the arm and offensive profile to be just fine in a corner. With off-the-charts makeup and work ethic, don't be surprised to see PERSON start to move a little more quickly and vault up prospect rankings.",-1
" PERSON' late father PERSON was a starting linebacker on PERSON's 1988 national championship team, and two of his older brothers played college football. PERSON was an honorable mention all-state wide receiver himself as a sophomore, but it was clear his future was on the diamond, with the ORGANIZATION taking him at the end of the second round and giving him $1.1 million to sign him away from GPE Carolina.At the plate, PERSON' quick hands and smooth swing help him make a lot of contact. His swing is geared toward hitting line drives, and he sprays them to all fields. He has above-average speed and uses it well on the basepaths. Scouts were divided on where PERSON fit best defensively as the ORGANIZATION approached. He'd played second base and the outfield, and the ORGANIZATION sent him out as a center fielder. Wherever he plays, he should hit well enough to be a regular no matter where he settles.",-1
"PERSON comes from a football family. One brother, T.J., is a wide receiver for the ORGANIZATION. His other brother, GPE, was the ORGANIZATION Receiver of the Year in 2018, and his late father, PERSON, won a national title with PERSON. PERSON was a two-sport star but always felt baseball was his passion, signing with the ORGANIZATION for above pick value in the second round of the 2015 Draft. An outfielder at the outset of his pro career, he shifted to second base in 2018 and reached Double-A.PERSON played second base in high school, but the jury had been out in his Draft year whether he would be better suited there or in the outfield. He had played solid defense in the outfield for the ORGANIZATION, but the organization felt he had a better chance of reaching the big leagues back on the infield. He's still learning the nuances of the position, getting a lot more reps during his strong ORGANIZATION stint, and should be capable enough to stay there. The position switch clearly impacted his offensive output, but he still showed the ability to draw walks, steal bases and drive the ball with sneaky pop, thanks to excellent bat speed.Despite the relatively down year offensively, the ORGANIZATION are confident PERSON will get back to his typical production now that he's more comfortable back on the dirt. His plus makeup and work ethic should aid him in becoming a solid everyday second baseman.",-1
"While the ORGANIZATION went the college route in taking catcher PERSON in the first round of the 2015 Draft, they went for a toolsy high school athlete in PERSON in Round 2. PERSON, whose father played college football and briefly in the ORGANIZATION and whose brothers also played football at a high level, looks like a tailback or safety, albeit one with a feel for baseball.PERSON does bring explosive athleticism to the field. He has terrific speed that helps him on both sides of the ball. He has a flat, line-drive stroke at the plate right now and he's shown a willingness to make adjustments. He does have bat speed and some strength, so when he adds some lift to his swing, he could grow into 12-15 home run type power. His speed works well in center field and he can outrun mistakes as he learns to improve his routes.More than his raw tools, PERSON' aptitude and off-the-charts makeup stand out and give him the chance to succeed at the highest level, with a chance to be an everyday center fielder in the big leagues a strong possibility.",-1
"GPE shortstop PERSON was the highest-profile player in the ORGANIZATION' 2018 international class but not the only potential impact player. PERSON, a GPE defector who signed for $975,000, might have the best pure hitting ability in the system. He made a strong impression during PERSON's instructional league and GPE programs during the offseason, then continued to stand out after coming to the GPE for his pro debut.PERSON has a tremendous approach for a teenager. He has a quick left-handed stroke, understands how to recognize pitches and manage the strike zone, and doesn't try to do too much. While's he's content to lash line drives to all fields for now, he has some raw power and should produce 15 or more homers annually as he continues to develop physically.Though PERSON played primarily left field in GPE's 15-and-under league, the ORGANIZATION believe he has a chance to stick in center. He's at least a solid runner and quicker once he gets going, though he'll need to improve his reads and routes. He has an average arm and should be capable of at least filling in at all three outfield spots.",-1
"PERSON moved faster than expected after signing for $450,000 out of GPE in 2016, reaching the Rookie-level GPE League during his pro debut the following summer. He overcame some early-season control issues to pitch well in Class A in 2018 until he blew out his elbow in GPE. He had PERSON surgery and may not return to game action until 2020.PERSON went from working with an 89-91 mph fastball when he signed to sitting at 93-95 mph and touching 97 with late hop and cutting action when he got hurt. He could add more velocity because he still has physical projection remaining and PERSON rehab often leaves pitchers stronger than ever. His hard slider has the potential to become a plus pitch and he also shows promising feel for his changeup. His long arms allow PERSON to create good extension and downhill plane on his pitches. He repeats his delivery well and had a history of throwing strikes until his elbow began to give out. If he can regain his health and upgrade his secondary pitches, he has a chance to become a No. 3 starter.",-1
"GPE of the ORGANIZATION' $19.3 million international spending binge in 2016, PERSON signed for $450,000 out of GPE. He moved more quickly than expected, earning two promotions during his 2017 pro debut, finishing that summer as the lone 17-year-old pitcher in the Rookie-level GPE, and faring well in low Class A at age 18 this year. But he blew out his elbow in GPE and had PERSON surgery that should sideline him all of next season.PERSON already is starting to deliver on the projectability that made him attractive as an amateur, as he went from sitting at 89-91 mph with his fastball at the beginning of last summer to working at 93-94 mph and touching 96 by the end. He could add more velocity as he continues to mature physically, and his heater has late hop and cutting action that keeps it off barrels. His slider has the upside to become a plus pitch and he shows feel for his changeup.PERSON' athleticism allows him to repeat his delivery and should translate into strikes, and his long arms create downhill plane that make life more difficult for hitters. If he can return to health and refine his changeup and command, he could develop into a No. 3 starter.",-1
"Signed in November 2015 out of GPE, PERSON excelled in the ORGANIZATION during his pro debut and enjoyed similar success the following year in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, finishing with the circuit's second-best GPE (1.59) and ORGANIZATION (0.96). Advancing to the Class A Short PERSON in 2018, PERSON paced all qualified ORGANIZATION York-Penn League hurlers in GPE (1.83), ORGANIZATION (0.98) and strikeouts (78).PERSON compensates for his lack of standout stuff with good feel for changing speeds and executing a solid three-pitch mix. His fastball sits around 88-90 mph, but his physically strong frame suggests there could be some more velocity to come. A slider and a changeup comprise his secondary arsenal, with the former currently ahead of the latter, and he's shown the ability to throw all three pitches for strikes.PERSON's success comes with the caveat that he's been a slightly older pitcher in younger leagues, but there's something to be said about his sheer dominance to begin his career. A move up to full-season ball in 2019 should offer a more representative glimpse of his potential.",-1
"GPE PERSON and PERSON were the two best high school pitching prospects in GPE in 2015, and the tall right-handers both spurned pro interest to attend college. They blossomed into two of the more dependable starters in power conferences, with PERSON excelling at ORGANIZATION and PERSON at ORGANIZATION after he moved into the rotation midway through his freshman season. He turned in his best collegiate season as a junior, after which the ORGANIZATION selected him n the fourth round. Though he looks the part of a power pitcher at an athletic 6-foot-6 and 225 pounds, PERSON doesn't have overpowering stuff. His fastball parks at 90-92 mph and peaks at 95, featuring armside run and a bit of sink. He relies heavily on his heater and a short slider in the low 80s, rarely using his serviceable changeup.Though he has a long arm action that can affect the consistency of his secondary pitches, PERSON has improved his control and command throughout his college career. There's little effort in his delivery and he repeats it well. His stuff may be as good as it's going to get, making his floor as a back-of-the-rotation starter or middle reliever stand out more than his ceiling.",-1
"The younger brother of PERSON, a ORGANIZATION of GPE product whom the ORGANIZATION drafted in the fifth round in 2015, PERSON put himself on the GPE radar with a breakout sophomore campaign for the ORGANIZATION. A broken wrist limited him to just 20 games as a junior, but the D-backs liked him enough to nab him with the ORGANIZATION. 39 overall pick and sign him for $1.65 million, just below pick value. The layoff had little impact on ORGANIZATION's pro debut, as he impressed in all facets of the game while reaching the Class A Short PERSON. ORGANIZATION has a solid track record at the plate, as he finished his ORGANIZATION career with a .337 average and then hit .288 in his pro debut, while showing more extra-base pop. His left-handed swing can be a bit rigid and features a flat bat path, but he tends to make consistently hard contact. His approach has been much more hit over power, but some tweaks to his swing mechanics and better use of his lower half could allow him to tap into more raw pop. A plus runner, ORGANIZATION has the speed and instincts to stay in center field, where he profiles as at least an above-average defender. ORGANIZATION is the type of advanced college hitter who could move quickly through the D-backs' system. There's everyday potential in the profile, especially if he can hit for more power, while his left-handed-hitting ability, speed and strong defense all portend to a high floor.",-1
"PERSON ORGANIZATION was drafted out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE in the fifth round of the 2015 Draft by the ORGANIZATION. Three years later, it was his younger brother's turn. While PERSON is a pure-hitting corner-outfield/first-base type, GPE is a fleet-footed center fielder, one who missed a chunk of his junior season at GPE with a broken wrist. The D-backs saw enough to nab him 39th overall and sign him for $1.65 million, just below pick value.While ORGANIZATION didn't play well with PERSON last summer, he did impress with a late stint in the ORGANIZATION and had a strong track record at GPE. Not all scouts loved his swing, which can have a flat bat path, but he tends to make consistently hard contact. His approach has been much more hit over power, but some tweaks to his swing mechanics could allow him to tap into his raw pop. He has the speed and instincts to stay in center field long-term.Some see a ORGANIZATION type if everything clicks for ORGANIZATION as a pro. Others compared him to 2017 first-rounder, and ORGANIZATION teammate, PERSON, now with the ORGANIZATION. He is the type of advanced college hitter who could move quickly through the D-backs system.",-1
"PERSON was a teammate of PERSON at ORGANIZATION in GPE, and they both had their names called on the first day of the 2015 Draft. While PERSON went to the ORGANIZATION with the ORGANIZATION. 5 pick, PERSON remained on the board until the ORGANIZATION took him at ORGANIZATION. 39 overall. Making his full-season debut the next year at age 19, PERSON posted a 3.31 GPE for ORGANIZATION A Peoria and then bested it at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Palm Beach in 2017, when he finished sixth in the system in GPE (3.10). And while the results weren't there for PERSON in 2018, he still made strides with his development, logging a career-high 145 innings while splitting his age-21 season between Double- and Triple-A. PERSON pitches with average velocity, with a four-seamer that tops out at around 94 mph, but his ability to sink his two-seamer and his command of the pitch make it play up. It leads to a lot of contact but few whiffs, underscoring his smaller margin for error, and his heater can be very hittable when left up in the zone -- something upper-level hitters capitalized on in 2018. His changeup is solid average, and his slider, while inconsistent, might get to PERSON average as well. PERSON noted that PERSON dialed back his aggressiveness in 2018, as he would nibble at the corners too much with his fastball and become very predictable with his sequencing after falling behind in the count. The ORGANIZATION are confident that he'll make the necessary adjustments in his approach to overcome those tendencies, citing his work ethic and competitiveness as reasons to believe the young right-hander eventually will put it all together en route to the ORGANIZATION.",-1
"PERSON PERSON, who went fifth overall in the 2015 Draft, wasn't the only reason scouts swarmed to ORGANIZATION in GPE, Fla.. They also went to see PERSON, whom the Cardinals drafted at ORGANIZATION. 39 in ORGANIZATION Round A and signed for $1.8 million.PERSON hit 94 mph in the first start of his high school senior season and maintained his velocity throughout the spring and deep into games. He usually works at 90-92 mph with good sink, and his athletic, projectable frame bodes well for his ability to add to his fastball in the future.PERSON's slider lacks consistency but shows flashes of becoming at least an average pitch. He didn't use a changeup much in high school, so that will be a point of emphasis going forward. He has the pitches, control and delivery to develop into a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"GPE initially came to ORGANIZATION to see outfielder PERSON, who ended up as the ORGANIZATION. 5 overall pick in the 2015 Draft. After announcing his own presence with an early spring dominant outing, PERSON kept pitching well enough for Plant to land in the ORGANIZATION A.PERSON has all of the ingredients of a future starting pitcher, with an intriguing combination of projectability and stuff. He has a solid fastball now, thrown typically in the low-90s, but there might be more velocity to come from his 6-foot-4 frame as he physically matures. He uses that frame to throw downhill with sink, eliciting a ton of groundball outs. Both his curve and his slider will flash average, with the former currently ahead of the latter. He spins his 11-to-5 curve well, while his slider backs up at times. The right-hander also mixes in a changeup that could be PERSON average as well.PERSON has the chance to have a legitimate four-pitch mix and the ability to command them fairly well. That's drawn comparisons to fellow farmhand PERSON and the ORGANIZATION would love to see PERSON follow the same path.",-1
"When PERSON was coming out of ORGANIZATION in GPE as a teammate of GPE prospect PERSON, he was a projectable prep right-hander with a solid feel for pitching. That pitchability remains his calling card, and though his stuff hasn't ticked up the way some anticipated, he's still had success, finishing sixth in the system in ORGANIZATION in 2017.Velocity-wise, PERSON's fastball is about average, with a four-seamer that tops out at around 94 mph, but his ability to sink his two-seamer and his command of the pitch make it play up. His changeup is solid average and his slider, while inconsistent, might get to PERSON average as well. But more than anything, PERSON is a strike-throwing groundball pitcher, one who is efficient with his pitches and able to log innings when he's at his best. He may never be a big swing-and-miss guy, but there is the chance that there is a bit more in the tank stuff wise given that he'll be just 21 for all of the 2018 season.The right-hander gets high marks for his work ethic and for understanding who he is as a pitcher. He is capable of using all of his pitches well, something he'll have to do to continue having this kind of success at the upper levels of the system.",-1
"PERSON may be getting used to not being the big man on campus, yet finding a way to succeed. He was a high school teammate of PERSON, who went No. 5 in the Draft in 2015 when PERSON went No. 39 overall. Then he went to full-season ball at age 19 in first full year of pro ball and while his ORGANIZATION would've been good enough for ninth in the league had he thrown enough innings, flame-throwers PERSON and PERSON got more attention in the same rotation.PERSON had success, but he didn't dominate, leading his prospect star to perhaps unfairly fade just a bit. Right now, he pitches with average stuff across the board. But he has a tall and projectable frame, with the chance there is more in the tank. So while his fastball is average right now, albeit with good sink, he could very well pick up some velo as he physically matures. He's utilized two breaking balls in the past, but will focus just on the slider moving forward, a pitch that has improved since he entered pro ball and has the chance to be at least PERSON average. His changeup has gotten better as well, and he could be looking at three average or better offerings when all is said and done.Kind of like ORGANIZATION, PERSON is more pitcher than thrower at a young age. If the stuff takes a leap forward, then PERSON has the chance to move up this list in a hurry.",-1
"PERSON drew a lot of PERSON comparisons from scouts last spring because both were GPE high school products and had similar offensive and defensive profiles at the same point in their careers. They also got picked in roughly the same part of the GPE, with PERSON going to the Expos in the second round in 1999 and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in the third round last June.Signed for $1.1 million, PERSON has an efficient right-handed swing and strong wrists that could produce double-digit home run totals. He struggled offensively in his pro debut, and he'll need to get stronger and improve his pitch recognition to reach his offensive ceiling. He's a solid runner with good instincts on the bases.PERSON broke into pro ball as a shortstop but reached the big leagues as a second baseman, and PERSON seems headed down the same path. PERSON moved him to second base for his first full pro season. He had the quickness and hands to stay at short, but his range and arm strength were just average at a position where clubs usually want better.",-1
"PERSON reminds scouts a lot of PERSON. They're both GPE high school products and were similar offensively and defensively at the same stage of their careers. They went in the same area of the GPE, PERSON to the Expos in 1999's second round and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in 2015's third round. Signed for $1.1 million, PERSON has an efficient right-handed swing and promising hitting ability. Though he's not big, he has strong wrists and could produce 15 homers per year in his prime. He has solid speed and is a smart baserunner.Like PERSON, PERSON was an amateur shortstop who broke into pro ball at that position but may be headed to second base in the long run. Though he has soft hands along with average range and arm strength at shortstop, average usually isn't good enough to cut it there defensively in the big leagues.",-1
"As a high schooler, PERSON earned comparisons to PERSON because both were GPE prepsters with similar offensive and defensive projections at the same stage of their careers. They were drafted in the same area, with PERSON the ORGANIZATION' second-rounder in 1999 and PERSON landing an over-slot $1.1 million bonus as a ORGANIZATION third-rounder in 2015. While PERSON immediately hit in pro ball, PERSON didn't get going at the plate until repeating high Class A this year.PERSON has a nice right-handed swing and finally is starting to sting the ball with more authority as he has added some strength and experience. He has made strides with his approach and his pitch recognition, though he still could use more patience. With his strong wrists and above-average speed, he has the upside to reach double figures in both homers and steals.Also like PERSON, PERSON was drafted as a shortstop but ticketed for second base in the long run. While his below-average arm limits his effectiveness on the left side of the infield, he has the quickness and hands to be a solid defender at second. Just as he has at the plate, he has gotten more consistent in the field with more exposure to pro ball.",-1
"ORGANIZATION transferred to PERSON Prep in GPE two years ago and because he was young for his grade, he re-classified and repeated his junior year when he got to the military school. The move paid off as his tools started showing up more consistently during his senior year, putting him on the GPE landscape. The ORGANIZATION didn't have a second-round pick, so ORGANIZATION became their second selection, taken in the third round of the 2019 GPE.ORGANIZATION shows flashes of all five tools, though he doesn't always consistently show them all at the same time. He didn't impact the ball that much on the summer showcase circuit, but scouts think his right-handed swing works and there should be average future power. It's a loose athletic swing with some bat speed, giving him the chance to hit, but there's some swing and miss and some work to be done on his approach. An excellent athlete, ORGANIZATION runs well and is aggressive on the basepaths. He's raw at shortstop, and he'll need to work on his angles and footwork, but might have the chance to stick there, thanks to decent hands, his athleticism and a strong arm that has been up to 92 mph on the mound.Given how raw ORGANIZATION is and how little experience he's had against top-level competition, patience will be key in his development. Even if he ends up having to move to center field, the ORGANIZATION could eventually have a dynamic up-the-middle player on their hands.",-1
"Because he was both the fastest player in the 2019 Draft and a high school outfielder from GPE, PERSON drew plenty of PERSON comparisons. He had almost no history against quality pitching and faced weak prep competition, so scouts weren't sure what to make of his bat. But his speed and athleticism got him selected in the fourth round by the FACILITY, who signed him for a below-slot $350,000.During the summer before his senior year, PERSON clocked a 6.21-second 60-yard dash at a Prospect Development Pipeline event and wreaked havoc on the bases at the LOCATION Pro showcase. His quickness allows him to beat out routine grounders, steal bases and cover plenty of ground in center field. He could become a plus defender if he gets more aggressive and his fringy arm is more than playable in center.Though he's still raw, PERSON shows the potential to make much more impact at the plate than PERSON. He has a quick right-handed stroke and strong hands, and he shows some ability to backspin the ball. If he can manage the strike zone and cope with breaking pitches, he could become an average hitter with double-digit home run power.",-1
"PERSON was a ""pop-up"" guy as a GPE high schooler as the 2017 PERSON approached, a young two-way player who saw a velocity spike raise his profile. A two-way player who was going to head to GPE, the ORGANIZATION took him in the fourth round and gave him second-round money to sign him, as a pitcher, away from joining the ORGANIZATION. He was in his first full year with the ORGANIZATION in 2018 when they sent him to the ORGANIZATION in early July.PERSON's velocity spike brought his upper-80s fastball to one that typically sits 92-96 mph with some sink. He has two distinct breaking pitches, an upper-70s curveball with good depth and a sweeping slider. The curve will flash plus, but is inconsistent as he sometimes has trouble commanding the pitch. His changeup, which he rarely used in high school, is now his best secondary offering in terms of its consistency.PERSON has the chance to add strength to his large 6-foot-5 frame and while he's still learning to find the strike zone regularly, he has the athleticism to be able to repeat his delivery in the future. The ORGANIZATION like upside arms like this, knowing that had PERSON gone to college he wouldn't be eligible for the PERSON until 2020, and they know they'll have to be patient to see what he might become.",-1
"A two-way player at FACILITY ORGANIZATION in GPE, Fla. -- PERSON's alma mater -- PERSON created debate as to whether he had a brighter future as a sweet-swinging first baseman or a projectable right-handed pitcher. When his velocity spiked during his senior season last spring, it became clear that his future was on the mound. The ORGANIZATION popped him in the fourth-round and gave him late second-round money ($822,500) to divert him from a commitment to GPE, then traded him to the ORGANIZATION in July 2018.PERSON's fastball jumped from the upper 80s on the showcase circuit during the summer before his senior year to 92-96 mph with sink last spring. He also has added more power to his breaking pitches, an upper-70s curveball that features good depth when he stays on top of it and a sweeping slider. He rarely used a changeup as an amateur but shows encouraging feel for the pitch.With a strong 6-foot-5 frame and a clean delivery, PERSON is equipped to remain a starter. Though he battled his control during his brief pro debut, he has the athleticism to do a better job of repeating his mechanics and throwing strikes. The ORGANIZATION will develop him patiently and he likely won't make his full-season debut until 2019.",-1
"Coming into 2017, scouts debated whether PERSON had a higher ceiling as a first baseman or as a right-handed pitcher. When his stuff picked up during his high school senior season, it became clear that he had a brighter future on the mound. The ORGANIZATION took him in the fourth round and signed him away from a Miami commitment for an over-slot $822,500.After working mostly in the upper 80s on the showcase circuit last summer, PERSON boosted his fastball to 92-96 mph with sink during the spring. He also added power to his breaking ball, which can get slurvy but is a true curveball in the upper 70s with nice depth when he stays on top of it. His changeup will need a lot of work after he used it sparingly as an amateur.With his size, strength and clean delivery, PERSON definitely projects as a starter. He has the athleticism to repeat his delivery and throw strikes.",-1
"An 18th-round pick by the ORGANIZATION in 2015, PERSON chose not to sign and instead spent one season at GPE (GPE) JC before signing for $75,000 as the ORGANIZATION' 15th-rounder in '16. He opened eyes with his performance on both sides of the ball during a strong pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League and then improved his stock even more in his first full season. PERSON's .309 average as a 19-year-old in the Class A GPE ORGANIZATION was second in the circuit and first in the organization, and it earned him honors as both a mid- and post-season All-Star honors as well as the ORGANIZATION' PERSON of the Year award. Surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his knee delayed PERSON at the outset of 2018, though no lingering effects were apparent once he finally made his season debut with PERSON in June. PERSON shows good feel for hitting, with a short, clean swing from the right side that yields consistently hard contact to all fields. A doubles machine early in his career, scouts believe PERSON will develop average over-the-fence based on his projectable frame, bat speed and leveraged plane through the hitting zone. PERSON's average speed serves him well as a baserunner as well as in the field. A shortstop as an amateur, PERSON has since transitioned to the hot corner. He profiles as an average defender there, with good athleticism and range as well as a plus arm, though he has been prone to defensive lapses early in his career. PERSON's first two pro seasons already has him looking like one of the biggest steals of the 2016 Draft. PERSON to play all of 2018 at age 20, PERSON's across-the-board tools, feel for the game and remaining physical projection all point towards him becoming an everyday third baseman at the highest level.",-1

He became property of the Marlins the following year, signing for $75,000 in the 15th round, and then made a name for himself on both sides of the ball with a strong pro debut in the ORGANIZATION. He continues to impress in 2017, earning an All-Star nod in the Class A GPE ORGANIZATION after ranking among the circuit's top hitters in the first half.PERSON shows good feel for hitting, with a short, clean swing from the right side that yields consistently hard contact to all fields. He doesn't show much power presently, but scouts believe he'll develop average pop based on his projectable frame, solid bat speed and leveraged plane through the hitting zone. Meanwhile, PERSON's average speed serves him well on the basepaths, as well as in the field. A shortstop as an amateur, PERSON spent his entire pro debut at the hot corner, where he profiles as an average defender with good athleticism and range as well as a plus arm.PERSON may have been a little-known commodity prior to last year's PERSON, but the early returns in his pro career, along with his across-the-board tools and remaining physical projection, suggests he could develop into an everyday player at the hot corner.",-1

The A's took PERSON in the second round that June, making him the ORGANIZATION' highest-drafted player in program history, and went above slot to sign him for $1.8 million.Athletic college players who can hit are always in demand, and PERSON fits that profile. He recognizes pitches and manages the strike zone well, using his quick left-handed swing to repeatedly barrel the ball. He has the strength for at least 15-homer power and perhaps more and also should provide plenty of doubles. What's more, PERSON has track record of performing well with wood bats, having overcome a slow start in the ORGANIZATION to bat .392 during a season-ending 20-game hitting streak.PERSON gets plus to plus-plus grades for his speed and was a successful if not especially prolific basestealer in college. He also uses his quickness well in center field, where he gets good jumps and can track down balls from gap to gap. His arm is his lone below-average tool but isn't a huge handicap in center.",-1
"A three-year starter at ORGANIZATION, PERSON improved each year in college and as he turned in a huge junior season, his name was popping up in 2018 first-round conversations. The A's were very happy he lasted until the second round, the earliest the ORGANIZATION have had a hitter selected, and signed him for an above-pick value bonus of $1.8 million. He was able to show off some of his tools in the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League during his pro debut, but a foot injury shelved him for the summer in mid-July. He was having a solid full-season debut in the GPE League when he was sent to the ORGANIZATION at the ORGANIZATION for right-hander PERSON Roark.While he isn't the tallest guy in the world, he's strong and athletic and has a strong track record of consistent hard contact from the left side of the plate. He has an advanced approach, managing the strike zone well and finding the barrel while being very quick to the ball. His bat speed and strength point to some over-the-fence pop and plenty of extra-base power. He's shown he can handle wood just fine, both in a scorching hot stretch to end his Cape Cod season in 2017 and during his brief pro debut. A plus runner, PERSON is an efficient baserunner with the potential to steal bases and cover a ton of ground in center field. He's a capable defender, albeit one with a fringy arm. He could start to move quickly given his all-around skillset, with a potential future as a No. 2 type hitter in a big league lineup awaiting.",-1
"GPE players have been drafted out of ORGANIZATION in GPE, but none have made it to the big leauges.

He has an intriguing three-pitch mix, starting with a 90-95 mph fastball he throws with good sink. He complements it with a solid slider and changeup and in making it to the full-season GPE League in his first full season in 2018 he missed bats and generated a lot of groundball outs.PERSON still has work to do in terms of his overall command, and he struggled to find the strike zone after his promotion, as he tried to do too much and fatigue set in. But the ORGANIZATION like his athleticism and how well he competes and think he has the chance to start long-term.",-1
"Taken in the 11th round of the 2017 Draft out of ORGANIZATION in GPE, the ORGANIZATION gave PERSON an above-slot bonus of more than twice the $100,000 post-10th round limit to keep him from transferring to ORGANIZATION in GPE. He's moved slowly through the lower levels of the ORGANIZATION system, though he did earn a promotion from the ORGANIZATION to the Class A Advanced PERSON in 2019.PERSON split the 2018 season between the rookie-level PERSON and full-season PERSON. With 32 walks allowed in 72 2/3 innings overall, there are definitely control issues to fix. The right-hander needs to be consistent with his curveball depth and finish and has had trouble repeating his delivery. Although he showed good arm speed and extension, his velocity seemed down while his command and control were spotty.Coaches could have to rework PERSON's delivery in the bullpen to find consistency, and perhaps that could return his fastball to mid-90s mph range he's shown in the past. He complements the heater with a solid slider and changeup and in making it to the full-season ORGANIZATION in his first full season in 2018 he missed bats and generated a lot of groundball outs.

He also proved himself with a strong summer in the ORGANIZATION League a year ago and has one of the higher floors among college position players in the 2019 crop. The ORGANIZATION took his safe bat No. 72 overall, in the ORGANIZATION, and signed him for full pick value, then sent him to the Class A Short-Season New York-Penn League for his debut.PERSON has a prettier swing than most right-handers and uses it to make consistent contact while controlling the strike zone. He has strength and leverage in his impressive 6-foot-3 frame, but his bat speed is merely average and has limited his power production. Unless he can quicken his stroke and perhaps add more loft, he may max out at 30-35 doubles and 15 homers per season at the next level.Athletic for his size, PERSON can produce some plus run times but likely will wind up with average speed as he gets older. He provides steady defense at third base, displaying average range and solid arm strength. He doesn't have any plus tools or glaring flaws, and scouts love his makeup.",-1
"PERSON was one of the top high school hitters, if not one of the best pure overall bats, in the 2018 ORGANIZATION class, one whose stock soared as the ORGANIZATION approached and he heard his name being mentioned as a potential top 10 pick. It was the ORGANIZATION who took the two-time GPE national 18-and-under team member No. 6 overall, signing him for more than a million under pick value. The ORGANIZATION, who picked 14th, had brought PERSON in for a pre-ORGANIZATION workout and liked him so much, they made sure to get him as part of the return for PERSON and PERSON in December.PERSON's outstanding feel for hitting from the left side of the plate, with an advanced approach, was on display during his summer debut, when he earned a promotion from the ORGANIZATION Coast to the GPE. He has a knack for barreling up the baseball with solid raw power some feel will eventually translate to above-average in-game pop as he matures. An above-average runner, PERSON is a very smart baserunner who can steal a base. The ORGANIZATION prep product was a center fielder in high school and that's where he played during his pro debut with the ORGANIZATION. While the jury is still out about his ability to stay there long-term, he does have the arm for right field should he have to slide over.PERSON is mature beyond his years and gets high grades for his makeup and work ethic, so making the transition to his new organization shouldn't be too difficult. He has the kind of offensive profile that could allow him to move a little more quickly than some high school hitters.",-1
"One of the top pure hitters in the 2018 Draft class, especially among the high school set, PERSON was one of the best bats for the GPE national 18-and-under team for two years in a row. A no-doubt first-rounder as the spring started, his name started popping up in top-10 pick conversations and he became the first PERSON product to go that high when the ORGANIZATION took him No. 6 overall, signing him for more than a million under pick value. Though PERSON would have an impressive pro debut across two levels, the ORGANIZATION packaged the young outfielder with PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON to GPE in exchange for PERSON and PERSON in December.PERSON has a tremendous feel for hitting from the left side of the plate, showing a professional approach and the ability to barrel up the baseball. He has solid raw power and above-average speed, giving him the ability to impact the game in a number of ways. PERSON played center field in high school, and the ORGANIZATION sent him out in that spot during his pro debut, but scouts weren't sure he'd be able to stick there long term. He does have the arm strength to handle right field should a move be in his future.PERSON gets as much high marks for his work ethic and attitude as he does for his physical gifts.

"It may have been PERSON that put the ORGANIZATION on the baseball prospect map when he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $6 million during the July 2015 international signing period, but the D-backs think they have a GPE worth watching in GPE. Coming from the same PERSON as PERSON, GPE signed for $200,000 during the same signing period.A left-handed-hitting shortstop, GPE is the kind of player who always catches your eye when he's on the field. Described by evaluators as a quick-twitch athlete, GPE plays with a lot of confidence. He makes consistent contact from the left side and could grow eventually into 12-15 home run power, especially as he refines his approach at the plate. An average runner, GPE has a solid average arm and consistently makes plays at shortstop. His tools and skills have already been showing up consistently in terms of his production and performance.Like PERSON, GPE came to the GPE to go to high school, playing in GPE, GPE, before returning to the ORGANIZATION. GPE is intent on beating PERSON to the big leagues, a friendly rivalry that should be fun to watch.",-1
"The last Bahamas-born player to reach the big leagues was PERSON. GPE, who got $200,000 from the D-backs to sign in July 2015, will be racing PERSON prospect PERSON to be the next. However, after a strong GPE debut in 2016, GPE's progress was slowed by a torn meniscus in May. GPE makes hard contact consistently from the left side of the plate and has some loft in his swing. That can be dangerous, as the organization does not want him to focus on power, believing it will come naturally as he develops. He does need to refine his pitch recognition and strike zone discipline, which will make him an even more effective hitter. He has all the tools to stick at shortstop long-term, with great hands and enough arm and range to perform well defensively. The D-backs didn't hesitate to send him to the ORGANIZATION for his debut, and they didn't shy away from pushing him at age 19 to full-season ball in 2017 because of his tremendous maturity and confidence, which will help him bounce back from his knee injury. Finding a balance of discipline and aggressiveness at the plate will be key to his offensive growth.",-1
"While the ORGANIZATION have some exciting young arms getting ready to impact the big leagues, there's another wave coming down below. PERSON has the chance to be a part of that with exciting raw stuff, though he is still in the nascent stages of figuring out how to use it. The young right-hander, signed back in 2015, has moved slowly since signing, spending parts of two summers in the ORGANIZATION (2015-16) and two in the ORGANIZATION (2016-17). He has a power arm that is capable of firing fastballs up to 95-96 mph, though he is still learning how to consistently maintain that velocity. His slider has the chance to be at least average and can miss bats on occasion. He shows some feel for a changeup, but he'll need to work on making it a more usable weapon moving forward. Like with many young pitchers, command is an issue, but when he's down the zone, he's shown a propensity for generating ground-ball outs. At this point, PERSON doesn't always repeat his delivery, which leads to the control problems and fluctuating stuff. He's still very much a project, but one who could end up having starting pitcher potential down the line.",-1
"The 2014-15 international signing period could end up being a very productive one for the ORGANIZATION.

PERSON has been slow to advance, spending two summers in the ORGANIZATION and parts of two in the ORGANIZATION before finally getting the chance to move to full-season ball in 2018. The results have been up-and-down, but the ORGANIZATION are still bullish on his stuff and the right-hander took a big step forward in 2019.PERSON has a live arm with a fastball up to 95-96 mph, a slider that flashes plus and misses bats and some feel for a changeup. What he hasn't shown to date is an ability to command his pitches or sequence them consistently. He falls in love with his fastball too much, thinking he can blow it by any hitter he faces. He needs to learn to trust his secondary stuff more, which in turn will help his fastball play up. That, plus dialing down his fastball a tick or two in order to achieve more consistent command, will help make him a more complete pitcher.PERSON has a long way to go in order to reach his ceiling. He surpassed the 100-innings plateau in a season for the first time in 2019 and needs those innings to take the next step in his development.

Before he blew out his elbow, he was throwing as well as he had as a pro, fueling hopes that he was poised for a breakout year in 2018.After working in the low 90s with his fastball while recording a 5.37 ERA during his first two years in pro ball, GPE sat in the mid-90s with armside run last spring. He also showed why scouts considered his curveball the best in the 2016 Draft, displaying a well above-average bender with power and depth. He has displayed feel for a changeup with some sink, but needs more time to refine it into a reliable third offering.Though GPE has yet to throw consistent strikes as a pro, he has the athleticism and clean delivery to do so. His 6-foot-6 frame helps him create plane and angle with his pitches, making them more difficult to barrel.

Even if his heater climbs into the mid-90s, it will take a back seat to a curveball with power and depth that was the consensus best breaking ball in his GPE class. He has some feel for a changeup that flashes some sink, but it lacks consistency because he hasn't had much experience throwing it yet.Though PERSON averaged 4.9 walks per nine innings in his first two seasons as a pro, his athleticism and clean delivery bode well for his ability to provide more strikes in the future.

"The 2015 international class produced a pair of GPE shortstops in GPE PERSON and GPE. But while PERSON was the more touted amateur prospect and signed with the ORGANIZATION for $6 million, it's been GPE who has blossomed into the better pro prospect since signing with the ORGANIZATION for $200,000. He led all Minor League shortstops with 25 homers in 2018, starred in the ORGANIZATION after the season and has continued to hit for power in Double-A this year, during which he got traded to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON in July. GPE posts impressive exit velocities from the left side of the plate with an explosive swing that has natural loft. He showed in 2018 that he not only could tap into his plus raw power, but also apply it across the entire field, as some of his longest home runs were hit to straightaway center. His power does come with swing-and-miss tendencies, so he'll need to refine his aggressive approach as he develops. He's an above-average runner who receives praise for his instincts on the basepaths. There is little question GPE can stay at shortstop, with good hands and actions to go along with a strong arm and a knack for making highlight-reel plays on a nightly basis.

He has a ton of offensive potential to tap into, with the ability to impact the baseball consistently and plenty of raw power. He needs to keep refining his approach from the left side of the plate and it looked like he was making strides in that regard, raising his OPS by over 300 points over the 10 games in May last year before he got hurt. The D-backs are hopeful those improvements carry over to 2018 and with a better approach, more over-the-fence power should follow.There is little question GPE can stay at shortstop, with good hands and actions to go along with enough arm for the premium position. As a kid from the ORGANIZATION who didn't face a ton of top-notch competition, GPE could take longer to learn the approach necessary to tap into his raw tools. The D-backs are hopeful a healthy 2018 will help move him in the right direction.",-1

The ORGANIZATION, however, took a gamble on him in the 12th round in June, then surprised many in the industry by signing him for $475,000. After performing well that summer during his pro debut, ORGANIZATION made noticeable strides in the ORGANIZATION League the following year before advancing to Class A Wisconsin in 2019.ORGANIZATION has plus speed and posts plus home-to-first run times from the left-handed batter's box. His speed also gives him above-average range in the outfield and makes him a threat on the bases, though he does have gains to make as a basestealer. At the plate, ORGANIZATION's left-handed swing yields hard contact and he'll flash power potential. Right now, however, the majority of his contact is on the ground, as his 69.9 percent ground-ball rate in 2018 was third-highest in the Minors among qualified hitters. Of course, that in turn highlights just how much ORGANIZATION stands to improve in the coming years, with the final product being a player who hits for average and power.ORGANIZATION has seen time across all three outfield spots early in his career but saw more time at the corners in 2019, logging nearly equal time in right and left field.

Progress on that front should also help him tap into his plus raw power, which is sure to show up even more as he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame. PERSON initially played some shortstop after signing, but he spent all of 2018 at third base. He's a raw and inconsistent defender at the hot corner right now, with arm strength and actions that give him a chance to stay there long-term.

With his stuff, command and plus presence on the mound, there isn't much more for PERSON to prove in the ORGANIZATION. He'll spend the 2019 season at age 21 with the chance to pitch at, or near, the top of a big league rotation soon, though his chance to make that rotation on Opening Day ended with a left shoulder strain during Spring Training.",-1
"PERSON had established himself as perhaps the most advanced pitchability high school lefty in the GPE class last summer and teams were initially excited when he broke out of the gate getting his fastball up to 97 mph. The enthusiasm was tempered quickly when PERSON blew out his elbow and needed PERSON surgery. Never one to shy away from drafting PERSON recipients, the PERSON selected the PERSON in the third round and gave him $1.4 million, more than twice pick value, to forgo his commitment to Miami.It's possible the physically mature 6-foot-1 southpaw was overthrowing, leading to the elbow injury. Over the summer, he was comfortably touching 93 mph and sitting in the 89-91 mph range. It played up thanks to its good sinking action and how well PERSON commands it. He can change speeds on his curveball well and has a very good feel for a changeup.The PERSON' success in developing PERSON and PERSON, whom they drafted in the first rounds in 2012 and '14, respectively, bodes well for PERSON's future. Though he'll be eased along as he continues to recover from GPE surgery, PERSON's all-around package gives him the potential to move up the ladder quickly once fully healthy.",-1
"GPE has done nothing but hit since signing with the ORGANIZATION for $400,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2014. He played in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON in 2018 and earned a promotion to Triple-A this July at age 21. Three weeks later, PERSON sent him and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for PERSON and PERSON has the ingredients to be a difference-maker with the bat, as he's already shown that he can hit for both average and power during games at a young age. He has a fluid swing and an innate ability to impact the baseball from the left side of the plate, and there are few within the organization who consistently hit the ball as hard as GPE. Scouts expect him to tap into more power as he gets stronger and learns how to lift the ball more consistently, but he will need to tone down his aggressiveness and become more selective along the way.GPE's athleticism and above-average speed serve him well in right field, where he projects as at least an above-average defender with a strong arm. He has the requisite offensive profile for the position, too, as a potential middle-of-the-order run producer.",-1
"While it's still very early in his career, PERSON, whom the ORGANIZATION signed for $400,000, looks like one of the gems from his year's international class. Making his stateside debut in 2016, the then-18-year-old batted a robust .329/.351/.549 with 25 extra-base hits in 56 games across two Rookie levels, including an impressive 14-game showing in the GPE League to finish the season. That progress continued for PERSON in 2017, with the outfielder earning All-Star honors with PERSON after he bypassed the ORGANIZATION level. PERSON may be loaded with tools, but he stands out most for his offensive ceiling. He has a fluid swing with an innate ability to impact the baseball from the left side of the plate, all the while demonstrating an advanced approach and power potential at a young age. He's an above-average runner who is still learning to effectively use his speed on the basepaths and in center field, where PERSON projects as at least an above-average defender.Though he profiles more as a top-of-the-order type right now, PERSON has the offensive tools to develop into a big-time run creator in the middle of a lineup.",-1
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION for $400,000 in 2014, PERSON is looking more and more like one of the gems from his year's international class. He excelled across two Rookie levels during his eye-opening stateside debut, finishing the season with a strong 14-game showing in the GPE, and then made even greater strides in the ORGANIZATION in 2017. Playing the entire season at age 19, PERSON finished second in the circuit with a .305 average and produced 15 home runs in 117 games. PERSON's offensive ceiling offers reason for excitement, as he's already shown that he can hit for average and apply his power during games at a young age. He has a fluid swing with an innate ability to impact the baseball from the left side of the plate, with an advanced approach and knack for hitting the ball in the air that belie his age. PERSON is an above-average runner who is still learning to effectively use his speed on the basepaths and in left field, where he projects as at least an above-average defender with a strong arm.Though PERSON is in the nascent stage of his career, his loud offensive tools and remaining physical projection could make him a middle-of-the-order force at maturity.",-1
" Prior to the 2017 ORGANIZATION, the top position player taken from PERSON in GPE had been PERSON, taken with the 37th overall pick back in 2006. PERSON, named of course for ORGANIZATION great PERSON, raised his stock considerably with a strong spring in the GPE area and beat Cardenas by five spots, signing for just over $260,000 below pick value. PERSON moved up ORGANIZATION boards over the spring, standing out as an all-around player who both swung the bat well and showed he can stay at shortstop. He's a solid defender with good range and an arm that grades out as a tick-above average. At the plate, he consistently barrels up balls with good power, especially given his size. He should grow into more over-the-fence power as he matures, while his baserunning acumen will allow him to pick up extra bases when he hits the gaps. He's not a burner, but he's very aggressive on the basepaths and likes to steal bases. PERSON gets high marks for his effort and brings a good amount of self-confidence to the field. That helped the ORGANIZATION feel comfortable with skipping the high schooler over the ORGANIZATION and up to the Rookie-level PERSON to kick off his pro career.",-1
"Named after PERSON and part of a baseball family that includes PERSON first-base prospect PERSON, PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION for $1,822,500 as the 32nd overall pick in the 2017 Draft. He made an easy transition to pro ball, more than holding his own against older competition in the Rookie-level PERSON during his debut and in the pitcher-friendly low Class A ORGANIZATION in his first full season. PERSON traded him to the ORGANIZATION in December as part of a trade for PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON Farmer.While PERSON isn't the biggest guy in the world, he barrels the ball consistently and drives the ball to all fields. He should hit for a high average thanks to a simple right-handed swing and a mature approach. He possesses average speed but he's an aggressive baserunner who likes to steal. If PERSON were a lock to stay at shortstop, he would have been a first-round pick. The ORGANIZATION were pleasantly surprised at how well he handled short in his debut but deployed him more at second base in 2018. His range and arm fit better at second, and some scouts wonder if he might wind up in center field.",-1
"Named after PERSON and the younger brother of ORGANIZATION first-base prospect PERSON, PERSON went 32nd overall in the 2017 Draft and signed with the ORGANIZATION for $1,822,500. Despite being one of the youngest regulars (age 19) in the pitcher-friendly Class A ORGANIZATION, he produced 13 homers and 37 steals in his first full pro season -- numbers matched by only one other Minor Leaguer (ORGANIZATION outfielder PERSON). The ORGANIZATION acquired him in December as part of a package for PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON has the tools to hit for average and power. He combines a simple right-handed swing with a patient, all-fields approach. He's strong for his size, delivering most of his home runs to his pull side and driving the ball to both gaps.Downs gets the most out of his average speed, parlaying his aggressiveness and instincts into stolen bases. He played shortstop in his pro debut but spent more time in 2018 at second base, where his arm and range are better fits. He returned to shortstop at the beginning of 2019 and there's also a possibility that he winds up in center field, but the good news is that he has the bat to profile at all three positions.",-1
"One of the best prospects in the 2015-16 international signing period class, PERSON's power potential was great enough to entice the ORGANIZATION to give him $4 million to sign that July. He made his pro debut in the GPE, holding his own in the ORGANIZATION in '16, then broke out with an All-Star campaign in the Short-Season New York-Penn League the following summer. A move to full-season ball in '18 did not go as well, as his approach regressed especially in the second half.PERSON's calling card, his raw power, is still very much there, and it can get at least a 70 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. The question has become whether he'll hit enough to tap into that power consistently enough. At times in 2018, it all clicks and he doesn't swing at pitches out of the zone. At others, he appears to have no plan at all at the plate. He continues to show he's athletic enough to play an outfield corner, showing a plus arm at times.PERSON's true value lies in his bat and how it develops. If he can find a level of consistency and come close to being an average hitter, then his power will show up in games on a regular basis, giving him the chance to be an every day run producer in the big leagues.",-1
"When the ORGANIZATION traded PERSON and PERSON to the D-backs, they did so to acquire more international bonus slot money. That money allowed them to go out and spend $4 million to sign PERSON, who was ranked No. 10 on MLBPipeline.com's ORGANIZATION list leading up to the July 2015 signing period.The ORGANIZATION were investing in PERSON's bat, and watch the big teenager swing the bat once and it's easy to see why. No one in this past international class had the raw power PERSON has, the kind of pop scouts haven't seen from the amateur scene in a long time. And it's not just raw power; PERSON has shown the ability to use it in game action. While there are things he needs to work on in terms of his approach, the ORGANIZATION were impressed with the feel to hit he exhibited during his time in instructs. They also saw someone more athletic than they anticipated, with a solid throwing arm. They might be in the minority, but they think he has the chance to stick in an outfield corner.Whether that's the case or whether he has to move to first like most anticipate, if his bat progresses as anticipated, he'll profile from just about anywhere.",-1
"You don't give a prospect, even one ranked at ORGANIZATION. 10 on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list in 2015, $4 million to sign if you don't have high expectations. After a solid debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2016, PERSON took a huge step forward as one of the youngest regulars in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in 2017, exceeding those expectations in many ways.PERSON improved in every facet of his game while playing at age 18 a year ago and he would have led his league in ORGANIZATION had he played enough to qualify. Everyone has known his raw power was legit and he started to tap into it during games more while becoming a more complete hitter. He can hit the ball out of any park and to all fields, showing the ability to go the other way. He'll still strike out some, but it's looking like he's going to make more than enough contact to be an average hitter. When he first signed, many thought he'd be limited to first base, but he's proven to be way more agile than anyone anticipated, has worked hard on his outfield play and should be a solid average defender with a strong arm for right field in the future.In addition to his tremendous offensive skills, PERSON gets high marks for his work ethic and desire to improve. He spent a good part of last fall in GPE, working on strength, conditioning and nutrition. Seeing him atop this list in the next couple of years seems a reasonable projection at this point.",-1
"When the ORGANIZATION gave PERSON $4 million to sign at age 16 when he was No. 10 prospect on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list in '15, they saw a future power presence in the middle of a big league lineup. There's still work to do, but his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION, finishing third in home runs and 10th in slugging, was impressive.Power is definitely PERSON's calling card and it's a legit plus tool, but the ORGANIZATION think he has a better feel to hit that will come as he gains more experience. He had a tendency to swing at breaking balls out of the zone and got himself out, something that the club is confident will dissipate with more reps and better pitch recognition. If he can manage a .250 average, the organization thinks PERSON will have 70-game power. PERSON is big but athletic for his size, and he has been better defensively in the outfield than many anticipated, with the kind of above-average arm you want to see in a right fielder. The teenager spent two months in the ORGANIZATION' conditioning program, so he's doing what he needs to in order to maintain his body.PERSON is ahead of some other young prospects the ORGANIZATION have signed at this stage, like PERSON. He has the chance to be an impact run-producing bat when all is said and done.",-1
"If you were to look up the definition of projectable right-hander, there might be a picture of PERSON next to it. The 6-foot-5 GPE, who signed back in December 2014 for just $65,000, made his GPE debut in 2016 and made an incremental step forward a year later. The results haven't caught up to the potential, but there's a lot to like here. The ORGANIZATION agreed, acquiring his upside in the ORGANIZATION trade.PERSON has an exciting three-pitch mix he is still in the process of learning how to use consistently. His mid-90s fastball jumps out of his hand and features heavy sink, which leads to a lot of ground-ball outs. The 20-year-old knows how to spin a breaking ball and it has the chance to be an above-average pitch in the future. Even his changeup, which is behind the other two, flashes above-average at times. His command and control remain a work in progress, but the hope is they will come as he grows into his frame and learns to trust his stuff.It can take time for a young arm with this much upside to click, so patience will be the key. But PERSON has the tools and the body to develop into a No. 3-type starter if everything comes together.",-1
"With some pitchers, just watching them throw a bullpen can make you sit up and take notice. GPE, who made his GPE debut in 2016 after his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION League the year prior, is one of those kinds of young arms -- one with a ton of upside.The ball really jumps out of GPE's hand, delivering a fastball that sits in the mid-90s now. He throws it with a lot of life, with heavy sink down in the zone that generates groundball outs. He can spin a good curveball, albeit not always consistently, though it looks like it could eventually be at least an above-average breaking ball. He has some feel for his changeup, giving him a potentially third Major League-average (or better) offering. He has a clean and smooth delivery that points to a future of throwing strikes.GPE has plenty of room to add strength to his 6-foot-5 frame, which could lead to even more velocity. Put a star next to his name, as he's a right-hander who could make a leap up prospect rankings in the coming years.",-1
"When deals are made at the ORGANIZATION, it can often be years before the trade can be truly evaluated. The D-backs knew they would get immediate help when they got PERSON from the ORGANIZATION in July 2018, but the ORGANIZATION knew they'd have to wait a while to see how good the key parts of the return, outfielder PERSON and PERSON, would be. PERSON did show glimpses of his enormous upside during his full-season debut in 2018, leaving the ORGANIZATION very excited to see what he can do in his first full season in the organization.PERSON has an exciting repertoire that points to a future in a big league rotation. He relies heavily on two distinct fastballs, a four-seamer that sits at 94-96 mph and touches 98 mph and a two-seamer that's a cross between a sinker and a splitter, thrown 90-93 miph, that misses a ton of bats and drives his strikeout rate. He can spin a curveball, flashing a plus breaking ball, and it's a point of focus for him in 2019. His changeup still needs work, but it has the chance to be an average pitch eventually. He's continued to refine his delivery and improve his command and control.There's still more in the tank for the 6-foot-5 PERSON and he could make a big leap up prospect lists as he moves up another level in 2019. He could be the next big high ceiling arm in the ORGANIZATION system after PERSON.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION' PERSON is one of the top catching prospects in baseball, and his brother PERSON was one of the best backstops available on the international market last summer. Signed for $750,000 out of GPE, PERSON is more polished than PERSON was at the same stage but lacks his older brother's lofty ceiling.PERSON's best tool is his strong arm. After improving his conditioning in the months leading up to his signing, he moves well behind the plate. He also shows promise as a receiver.While defense is his forte, PERSON can contribute offensively as well. He's a switch-hitter with plus raw power and the disciplined approach to translate it into production. He's advanced enough offensively and defensively that he came to the GPE as a 17-year-old for his pro debut.",-1
"The GPE signed PERSON for $150,000 in July 2016, roughly one year after the club watched the young outfielder play for GPE's 15-and-under national team in the Pan-American Championships. He showed promise the next year during his professional debut in the ORGANIZATION, then established himself as a bona fide prospect with a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON' performance caught the attention of the ORGANIZATION, who had scouted him as an amateur, and they acquired him and ORGANIZATION in July in exchange for PERSON. Bumped up to the ORGANIZATION' Gulf Coast League affiliate after the trade, PERSON slashed .397/.493/.683 over 17 games.PERSON is a physical specimen who has already started to grow into his projectable frame and had his tools improve as a result. A 6-foot-4 right-handed hitter, he generates plus raw power to all fields through a combination of bat speed, physical strength and solid feel for the barrel. He has the foundation of a solid approach, leading scouts to peg him as someone who could hit for average and power. PERSON has average speed and moves well in right field, where his plus arm strength is a clean fit. With his power-over-hit offensive profile and cannon arm, PERSON looks every bit the part of a future big league right fielder. He's very young, and therefore will need time to develop, but the long-term product could be an impactful, above-average player.",-1
"PERSON nearly signed with the ORGANIZATION as an international free agent out of the ORGANIZATION, but it was ruled he was ineligible because he had moved to GPE, Pa., to go to high school. While he didn't play baseball there, he had to be drafted, something the ORGANIZATION took care of in the eighth round of the 2017 Draft, signing him for $50,000 and then watching him carve up hitters in the ORGANIZATION during his pro debut.While PERSON isn't the biggest pitcher in the world at 6-foot-1, the left-hander does have a durable body that looks like it should be able to log some innings as a starter. He also has a three-pitch mix that he uses well. His fastball will sit 91-92 mph and will often touch 94 mph. His changeup flashes above-average and while his breaking ball is fringy, he does flash an average curve to imagine he could get there consistently at some point in the future.At 20 years old, PERSON isn't your typical high school draftee in his first full year of pro ball age-wise. But he is innings and mound-time wise, so some patience is called for, with a back-end starter the potential end result.",-1
"PERSON originally signed with the ORGANIZATION for $300,000 last September, but that deal was voided in November as part of the penalty levied against the organization for violation of baseball's rules on signing international amateur free agents. The ORGANIZATION, who had scouted the LOCATION amateur heavily before he signed with PERSON, were happy to swoop in and sign him, partially using international bonus money procured in the PERSON trade to sign PERSON for $1.2 million in December.The ORGANIZATION got their first extended look at PERSON in GPE Training and were pleased with what they saw, both in terms of his raw tools and feel for the game, especially given his lack of experience. A plus runner, his speed is his best tool and should help him steal bases and cover plenty of ground in the infield. PERSON was initially a second baseman as an amateur, but as he's grown and developed, he moved over to short, and the ORGANIZATION believe he has the tools, actions and arm to stay there long-term. He has shown the ability to make consistent contact at the plate, using all fields, and has surprised a bit with his ability to drive the ball, something that will improve as he physically matures.PERSON obviously has a long way to go and will take his first step as a professional this summer. But the ORGANIZATION feel eventually he could eventually develop into a top-of-the-order catalyst who plays a premium position.",-1
"PERSON had agreed to a deal for $300,000 with the ORGANIZATION in September 2017, but it was voided two months later as part of the penalty for their violations on the international market. The ORGANIZATION had some extra international bonus money, courtesy of the PERSON trade, and were able to bring PERSON into the fold for $1.2 million in December. He had a strong professional debut in the ORGANIZATION, but that was clouded when, in October, he was convicted of assaulting his former girlfriend in GPE has the chance to have a very good hit tool thanks to excellent hand-eye coordination. That's a blessing and a curse, because while he rarely strikes out, he showed a propensity to swing at everything to make contact. The ORGANIZATION are having the left-handed-hitting shortstop focus on zoning better, so he can find better pitches to drive and so he won't get exposed by better breaking stuff as he moves up the ladder. There is some impact to unlock with his swing, he uses his body well, so there should be some power in the future. At least a plus runner, PERSON should have the ability to steal bases as well.Defensively, PERSON has the makings of a solid shortstop, with good hands and enough arm. He gets out of control fundamentally at times, leading to more errors than necessary. Consistency there should allow him to perhaps be an everyday shortstop when all is said and done.",-1
"PERSON PERSON (PERSON, GPE) featured not only one of the best bats in the 2019 prep class in third baseman PERSON (selected 12th overall to the ORGANIZATION) but also one of the more projectable arms in GPE. He missed the state playoffs with a lat strain but still went in the second round to the ORGANIZATION and signed for an above-slot $1,097,500. His father PERSON also was a right-hander taken in the second round (PERSON, 1991) and reached Triple-A.GPE already can maintain low-90s velocity deep into games and tops out at 95 mph with his fastball, which should get quicker as he adds more strength to his 6-foot-6 frame. He backs up his heater with an upper-70s curveball with good depth that can become a plus pitch if he improves its consistency. He also demonstrates some aptitude for a changeup that he'll need to use more often in pro ball.GPE has a fairly simple delivery for such a tall pitcher, and his athleticism and strength should lend themselves to control and durability. He uses his size and a high-three-quarters arm slot to deliver his pitches on a steep downhill plane. He also offers intriguing hitting ability and some power potential, which could have made him a two-way player had he followed through on his commitment to PERSON.",-1
"Bleday won a starting job at ORGANIZATION as a freshman in 2017 and was the ORGANIZATION' best hitter as a sophomore, when scouts voted him the best prospect in the summer PERSON. That all served as a prelude to special 2019 season in which he led ORGANIZATION Division I with 27 homers and 192 total bases while helping ORGANIZATION win its second PERSON Series championship. The LOCATION player of the year, he went fourth overall in the Draft to the ORGANIZATION and signed for a franchise-record $6.67 million.Coming into the year, Bleday stood out more for his pure hitting ability than his pop. He has a smooth, quick left-handed swing, a disciplined approach and a willingness to use the whole field. He possessed the bat speed, strength and leverage in his 6-foot-3 frame to produce plus power, and he started doing so once he began looking to attack and lift more pitches.A two-way player as a GPE high schooler, Bleday has a plus arm that adds to his right-field profile. While he's a below-average runner, he has enough range to get the job done on defense. His keen instincts help compensate for his lack of quickness on the bases and in the outfield.",-1
"GPE (PERSON) PERSON had three premium pitching prospects on its 2018 team that went 32-9 and finished third in the state 6-A playoffs. PERSON had top-five-rounds talent but his desire to attend PERSON compromised his signability, while then-junior right-handers and PERSON A&M commits PERSON and PERSON emerged as potential top-three-rounds picks. While PERSON was more highly regarded entering 2019, PERSON outpitched him for the second straight spring to become the higher pick (ORGANIZATION Round A) in June, signing with the ORGANIZATION for slot value at $2.05 million.PERSON usually operates at 90-92 mph with his fastball, though he has reached 96 mph and should deal in the mid 90s more regularly once he fills out his very projectable 6-foot-3 frame. He had one of the better sliders in the high school ranks, a low-80s breaker with late bite and two-plane depth at times. He also has good feel for a changeup with similar velocity and some fade.PERSON isn't as athletic as PERSON, whom the FACILITY took in the second round, but he repeats his delivery well and owns better present command. He has a quick, whippy arm that works well, though his arm action does get long in back. He should be able to hold up as a pro starter once he adds some strength.",-1
"Remember when there was concern about ORGANIZATION's ability to hit at the pro level coming out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks in 2017, even though he was the state's PERSON of the Year and led all prepsters with 25 home runs? Yeah, no one else does, either, not after ORGANIZATION raked across two levels of GPE ball during his summer debut then hit his way all the way to Double-A at age 19 in 2018, fitting in a Futures Game appearance for good measure. Hamstring and ankle injuries shelved him in GPE Training, and he was sidelined for an extended period of time.While the swing-and-miss tendencies that concerned some scouts still remain with ORGANIZATION, his bat speed and ability to read pitches and make adjustments more than outstrip the worry. He's shown the ability to drive the ball to all fields and his over-the-fence pop started showing up consistently during his first full season. Yes, ORGANIZATION can still refine his overall approach to see more pitches and draw more walks, but the strides he has quickly made in pitch recognition bode well for his future at the plate. ORGANIZATION's speed works on both sides of the ball, giving him the ability to steal some bases and enough range to play center field, especially as he improves his reads and routes. Should he slow down a touch as he physically matures, ORGANIZATION has shown the ability to play the outfield corners. A shoulder issue that kept him from playing the outfield in 2017 is a distant memory and the plus arm that allowed him to crank out plus fastballs from the mound in high school has returned. The five-tool outfielder is way ahead of schedule and could be patrolling the ORGANIZATION outfield alongside Mike PERSON sooner rather than later.",-1
"From a raw tools perspective, there may not have been anyone more enticing in the 2017 Draft class than ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION high school star was his state's PERSON of the Year and led all high school hitters with 25 home runs. While there was some concern about his ability to hit, the ORGANIZATION liked the upside enough to take him No. 10 overall and sign him for full pick value. He then went out and showed off all of those tools across two levels of rookie ball during his pro debut, and kept on doing it across two levels of A ball in his first full season, earning a trip to the ORGANIZATION in the process.While no one questions ORGANIZATION's raw power and bat speed from the right side, some were concerned with his ability to make enough contact to tap into it due to some swing-and-miss tendencies that showed up against top competition on the summer showcase circuit. There were some strikeouts during his debut, but he impressed the ORGANIZATION with his ability to make adjustments and drive the ball to all fields. A tremendous athlete with plus speed, ORGANIZATION has the chance to continue to be a basestealing threat long term. It also helps give him plenty of range to patrol center, though he didn't play the outfield last summer because of a minor shoulder issue. His plus arm, which fired upper-90s fastballs from the mound in high school, would also work in right.Even with the exciting debut, patience will be key in the dynamic outfielder's development. If it all continues to click, he could develop into the kind of All-Star performer teams hope to get with their first-round selections.",-1
"There may not have been a 2017 Draft prospect with better all-around tools than ORGANIZATION, who drew comparisons to former No. 2 overall Draft picks like PERSON and PERSON Jr. based on his athletic ability. ORGANIZATION didn't go that high, but he did land at the end of the Top 10 to the PERSON, who reversed course from taking a pure college performer in the first round in 2016 to sign ORGANIZATION for full pick value.The PERSON high school standout led all high school players in the country with 25 homers and was named his state's Gatorade player of the year, but there were still concerns about his ability to hit enough to tap into that power at the next level. The pop is legit, with outstanding bat speed from the right side of the plate translating to plus raw power. With that, however, has come a tendency to swing and miss, and there is work to be done on his approach at the plate. He's a plus athlete with a big league body already, with incredible speed that should work on both sides of the ball. He's a very good defensive center fielder, with a strong arm that fired fastballs up to 97 mph at times off the mound.The PERSON will have to be patient with ORGANIZATION as he learns to make adjustments at the pro level. If it all clicks, he has All-Star potential.",-1
"Pitchers who already have been relegated to a relief-only role before they've even reached full-season ball don't typically garner much buzz as prospects. PERSON, however, is an exception. Signed by GPE at the outset of the 2016-17 international period, he made his GPE debut as a 20-year-old in 2018, pitching well in the ORGANIZATION before a promotion to Class A Short-Season Auburn in GPE. PERSON's bullpen potential was on full display last season as he paired a mid-to-upper 90s fastball with a nasty slider to average 11.7 strikeouts-per-nine over 30 2/3 frames. The breaking ball has above-average potential, and PERSON has enough feel for a changeup that it could be an average pitch in time. While PERSON's lightening-quick-arm causes the ball to explode out of his hand, he struggles to repeat his delivery and harness his stuff, leading to well-below-average control (6.5 walks-per-nine in '18). The ORGANIZATION were pleased with PERSON's performance during instructional league, where he did a better job throwing strikes without it detracting from his stuff. If he can continue to improve his overall control, as well as his fastball command, PERSON could move through the Minors quickly.",-1
"PERSON emerged as a top prospect for the 2018 Draft as a sophomore, and while he did plateau a bit, there were still few players with better all-around potential in his prep class. As a toolsy right-handed hitter from the ORGANIZATION with a similar build, he draws comparisons to PERSON. After hitting .491 with a .611 ORGANIZATION and six home runs during his senior year at GSP (ORGANIZATION.) High, PERSON became the program's first player to be drafted since 2007, going to the ORGANIZATION in the second round.

They drafted him as a third baseman and paid him an above-slot $1.6 million in the second round.Part of three GPE state 6-A championship teams at ORGANIZATION McCarthy High (PERSON), PERSON saw more action and had more success as a hitter than he did as a pitcher. His bat speed and strength give him plus raw power, and he showed it off by homering at spotlight events such as the ORGANIZATION Games and the ORGANIZATION. He has a sound right-handed swing and did a better job of making contact and using the whole field as a senior, so PERSON believes he can hit for average and pop.PERSON obviously has the arm strength for third base.

"There's little doubt about PERSON's ability to swing the bat. He batted .606 as a junior at GPE (Va.) High, and then followed the performance by posting a .392 mark last spring. His size and lack of profile, however, made him a bit of a polarizing prospect among scouts, although that didn't keep the Mariners from drafting him in the second round. After signing for an above-slot bonus of $1,750,000, PERSON showcased his promising bat with a strong start to his career in the Rookie-level PERSON League.The left-handed hitting third baseman can flat-out rake as possibly the best pure hitter in his area. He barrels balls up consistently and has some power to go along with it. Everything else, though, is a bit of a question mark. Scouts have seen PERSON play an adequate third base, but there is far from consensus that he can stay there, meaning he'd have to move to first or perhaps to left field, though the jury is still out over whether he's athletic enough for such a move. He's under six feet tall and doesn't have much projection to him, so he kind of is what he is at this point.Beyond his physical tools, the Mariners rave about PERSON's makeup and baseball IQ, both of which should help him to make a smooth adjustment to pro ball.",-1
"As the 2016 GPE approached, scouts weren't sure what to make of GPE high school senior PERSON, a third baseman who looked like he could hit but who was hard to profile because of his 5-foot-9 frame and lack of a sure defensive home. Now, two-plus years after the ORGANIZATION went above pick value in the second round of that GPE to sign PERSON for $1.75 million, he's still tough to figure out. PERSON had a solid first full season, holding his own in the ORGANIZATION as a teenager, earning a late bump up to the GPE, where he caught fire and won the championship series ORGANIZATION. It seemed to carry over to the first half of the 2018 season back with PERSON, but then he fell into bad habits and badly regressed. He often doesn't have a lot of balance or foundation in his swing, causing him to drift. He managed to cut his strikeout rate down, but he wasn't impacting the ball like he's capable of. The ORGANIZATION have worked with PERSON on the timing of his swing along with where his lower half and hands are. Defensively, he's still a third baseman and will stay there, though he played a handful of games at second and first base last year.The ORGANIZATION would like PERSON to get back to being the hitter he was at the GPE, one who made consistent hard contact with the ability to drive the ball. This is a big year for PERSON, but he's still plenty young enough to head back in the right direction.",-1
"PERSON turned down the chance to go in the first five rounds of the 2015 GPE as a GPE high schooler to attend PERSON, where he improved offensively and defensively. The ORGANIZATION player of the year and defensive player of the year in 2018, he went ORGANIZATION. 2 overall to the ORGANIZATION and signed for the largest up-front bonus for a position player ($7,025,000) in GPE history to that point. He continued to impress in his pro debut, finishing third in the short-season LOCATION with 13 homers despite playing just 45 games of a 76-game schedule.Thanks to his bat speed, strength and leverage, PERSON rivaled PERSON (ORGANIZATION. 3 overall to the Phillies) as the best right-handed power hitter in the 2018 GPE. He learned in college that he has natural power and doesn't have to swing for the fences, and he has the potential to produce 25 homers per season. With his controlled swing and improved plate discipline, he should hit for average to go with his pop.Scouts were divided on PERSON's ability to stay behind the plate when he was coming out of high school, but he has put those questions to rest. He lacks speed like most catchers but is relatively athletic for his position, moves well behind the plate and has made himself into a solid receiver. He has a strong arm and threw out 39 percent of basestealers during his debut.",-1
"A potential top-five-rounds pick after leading PERSON to the ORGANIZATION 4A state championship in 2015, PERSON instead fell to the ORGANIZATION in the 27th round because of his commitment to ORGANIZATION. His decision to attend college paid off handsomely, as he went No. 2 overall in the 2018 GPE and received the largest up-front bonus ($7.025 million) for a position player in GPE history. PERSON improved offensively and defensively throughout his time with the ORGANIZATION, blossoming into the ORGANIZATION of the Year and PERSON of the Year as a junior.With his bat speed, strength and leverage, PERSON generates power to all fields from the right side of the plate. He improved as a hitter as he has understood that he doesn't have to sell out for home runs. PERSON made tremendous strides with his plate discipline during the spring, and he has the swing and feel for hitting to produce solid batting averages.While there were questions about PERSON's defensive ability when he arrived at ORGANIZATION, that's not the case any longer. He has cleaned up his receiving and there's no doubt that he can stay at catcher, where his strong arm deters the running game. PERSON is relatively athletic for his position, though he's not a factor on the bases.",-1
"Under general manager A.J. PERSON, the ORGANIZATION have had success with mid-to-late round pitchers. PERSON might be the latest steal. A 16th-round selection from PERSON in GPE, the left-hander was one of the youngest players in the 2017 Draft. He signed for fifth-round value at $302,500, and it's been money well spent for the ORGANIZATION, who pried him from his GPE commitment. As an 18-year-old in rookie ball in 2018, PERSON struck out 58 hitters over 45 1/3 innings while notching a 2.18 ERA. He finished the year with a singular start at ORGANIZATION A Fort Wayne, and he opened the '19 campaign there, where he continued to post excellent strikeout numbers while limiting baserunners. A 6-foot-4 lefty with an athletic frame, PERSON's frame has projection. His delivery is somewhat quirky, but he repeats it easily, and he's honed his mechanics nicely since his arrival in pro ball. PERSON's fastball sits around 90 mph with movement, and his changeup is an excellent complement. He'll need to improve his command of his breaking pitches, however.",-1
"PERSON PERSON set an Illinois record with 14 saves in 2015, when the PERSON made him the ORGANIZATION. 6 overall choice in the GPE. This spring, PERSON matched PERSON by the end of the regular season and also climbed to within two of his GPE career mark of 24 saves. Though he didn't go as high in the GPE as PERSON, PERSON's impressive career still netted him a sixth-round selection and $167,400 signing bonus in June.A pure reliever who has never started a game in three years of college or during summer ball, PERSON attacks hitters with two pitches. He has sat at 92-96 mph with his fastball throughout the spring, even when working on consecutive days. PERSON's sharp 82-85 mph slider can be a plus pitch at times and is especially tough on right-handers.PERSON has a lot of flying parts in his funky delivery, which provides deception but also hampers his command at times. How well he can locate his pitches ultimately will determine if he reaches his ceiling as a set-up man. PERSON's strong 6-foot-4 frame and resilient arm make him a durable bullpen option, and he should be one of the first 2018 draftees to reach the big leagues.",-1
"While GPE racked up 14 saves as a junior reliever at ORGANIZATION, giving him 22 for his career, he didn't have nearly the GPE profile as former ORGANIZATION closer PERSON, the school's career saves leader who was the ORGANIZATION. 6 overall pick by the Twins in 2015. But ORGANIZATION scout PERSON liked his size and stuff, leading to his selection in the eighth round of the 2018 GPE. If his summer debut, which included reaching full-season ball, saving eight games and striking out 15.1 per nine, is any indication, the ORGANIZATION might have gotten a steal.GPE goes right after hitters with a two-pitch mix and an intimidating mound presence, thanks in part to his strong 6-foot-4 frame. His fastball was up to 96 mph at ORGANIZATION and he's now up to 95-97 mph as a pro with premium spin rate, with some thinking he could end up with a legitimate 70 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. He backs up the fastball with a slider that flashes plus and he gets swings and misses with both pitches. GPE's funky delivery creates deception, but it also leads to command problems. He'll have to continue to work on keeping his walk rate down in order to pitch late in games in the big leagues.In addition to the stuff and physicality, the ORGANIZATION knew GPE's plus makeup -- he graduated in three years with a degree in accounting -- would serve him well. His work ethic, smarts and conviction in his pitches should allow him to move quickly.",-1
"PERSON didn't pitch at all last summer on the showcase circuit because of a dead arm, showing a ton of power as a first baseman. His arm bounced back during his senior season in the ORGANIZATION high school ranks, cementing his future as a pitcher and throwing well enough for the ORGANIZATION to take him 40th overall and signing for a well-above pick value bonus just north of $3 million.Whilte PERSON's fastball topped out at 90 mph before his dead arm period, a throwing program while he nursed his arm back to health allowed him to operate at 90-95 mph this spring. Tall and projectable, there might be more to come velocity-wise, and his fastball already plays up because it has armside run and his size creates difficult angle. He has a pair of solid secondary pitches in a curveball with depth and a changeup with fade, and he could have three plus offerings when fully developed.PERSON has good body control for a 6-foot-5 high schooler. His arm action is clean and his athleticism allows him to repeat his delivery and throw strikes with ease. He's very competitive and gives the ORGANIZATION another potential frontline starter from the 2016 Draft class.",-1
"Things were going exactly according to plan over PERSON's first year-plus in the ORGANIZATION organization. After signing for just over $3 million, a well over slot deal for the 40th pick of the 2016 Draft, PERSON had a solid pro debut and was named the LOCATION PERSON's Most Outstanding Pitcher in his first full season the following year. The PERSON train got slowed in 2018, not because of performance, but because he was bitten by the injury bug, though he bounced back with a healthy, albeit a bit inconsistent, 2019 campaign, only to be traded to the Tigers with PERSON for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION Deadline.An oblique injury contributed to the left-hander being able to only make 16 starts in 2018. The good news is that he looked very much like the same pitcher he's always been when he was on the mound. PERSON has a three-pitch mix he uses well to keep hitters guessing. His fastball sits around 92-93 mph and can touch a bit higher, a pitch that plays up because he commands it and throws it with good life. Both of his secondary offerings, his changeup and curve, could be at least above-average pitches in the future. He could still stand to tighten his breaking ball a bit more. It has good shape to it, but making it a little sharper could help it become a true out pitch.The southpaw also stands out because of his competitive nature, which can almost be a negative when he's too hard on himself. That makeup plus his size and feel for pitching should allow him to keep rising up the ladder and reach his ceiling as a mid-rotation starter, assuming he stays healthy.",-1
"When the ORGANIZATION signed their top pick PERSON for more than $2.5 million below pick value in 2016, that enabled them to aggressively go after other talent. That included PERSON, the ORGANIZATION high school two-way standout, who received just over $3 million as the 40th overall pick. After four scoreless outings in the ORGANIZATION to start his pro career, PERSON finished off the season up in the Rookie-level Appalachian League.While PERSON didn't show the velocity some expected -- he had been up to 96 mph in high school -- he did show an impressive feel for pitching, especially given his age and experience level. There's confidence that there is more in the tank, but he may be more of a 92-94 mph guy than one who finds the upper-90s regularly. The pitch will play up anyway because of its armside run and because he creates good angle with his 6-foot-5 frame. His curveball has depth, and he has good feel for a fading changeup, with both secondary offerings looking like they could be above-average pitches in the future. He walked too many batters during his pro debut, particularly up in the ORGANIZATION, but with a clean and repeatable delivery, he started to show better command in his first full season and should find the strike zone enough to succeed.PERSON's combination of future ceiling and now pitchability give him an exciting future. Seeing him as a future No. 3 is easy, with that perhaps being too conservative of a ceiling.",-1
"It's become a familiar pattern for the ORGANIZATION late: Go aggressively after high school pitching early in the GPE, then watch as they excel in their first full seasons. PERSON followed the script perfectly, signing for just over $3 million as the 40th overall pick in the 2016 GPE, then finishing second in the LOCATION League in strikeouts and fourth in ORGANIZATION during his introduction to full-season ball.PERSON has a solid, if unspectacular, three-pitch mix that he has shown an ability to use well to dominate hitters. He'll be able to sit comfortably with his fastball in the 92-93 mph range, and it plays up because of its life and his ability to command it well. His curve and changeup both flash above-average to plus and he's shown a willingness to go to one secondary pitch if the other one isn't working on any given night. He has a feel to spin the breaking ball, but it could use a little more sharpness to become a true out pitch.PERSON is a plus competitor who showed he could handle getting out of trouble when he needed to. He might not have the highest ceiling of the core of talented young pitchers in the ORGANIZATION system, but he seems a strong bet to fit nicely into the middle of a rotation in the future.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION did some serious spending on international prospects in 2016, going heavy on GPE imports and handing out four seven-figure bonuses in the process. PERSON signed for $1.9 million, the second-highest payday doled out by the organization that year after PERSON's $2.35 million bonus. The right-hander's GPE debut was a bit uneven, and he endured similar struggles early in 2018 at ORGANIZATION A GPE, posting a 6.47 ERA through his first 10 starts. But PERSON settled in after that and pitched well the rest of the way, registering a 3.10 ERA and averaging nearly a strikeout per inning over his final 81 1/3 frames. PERSON's fastball hasn't quite ticked back up to where it was when he was up to 96-97 mph shortly after signing, but there's plenty there, sitting in the 92-94 mph range and touching a bit higher even as he works deep into starts. His curve and changeup are both developing along with his command, which currently is well below-average. The ORGANIZATION think there's an above-average breaking ball in there with further refinement, while his changeup already flashes above-average and could be a near-plus offering at maturity. ORGANIZATION officials were impressed with the adjustments PERSON made halfway into his first full season, praising him for how he remained focused after a shaky April and May. A huge physical specimen at 6-foot-6, the right-hander will continue to work on getting his frame in sync and repeating his delivery, and the belief is that it will lead to more consistent strike-throwing with his three-pitch mix.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION went all-in on the international amateur market last July, spending more than $10.8 million, going over their bonus pool by more than $8.7 million. Four players got a seven-figure bonus and three of them have landed on this Top 30. One of them is PERSON, a right-handed man child with some pretty good stuff.The 6-foot-6 PERSON will pitch all year at age 19, and he has already shown a little more polish than your average teenage pitcher. While most hurlers his age and size resemble awkward giraffes, he already looks like a man, with decent command and pitchability of some good stuff. PERSON's fastball sits in the 92-94 mph range and easily touches 96 mph. His curveball is his next best pitch, and while it needs work, it has the chance to be a nasty breaking ball. PERSON even has a feel for a changeup.After dominating the ORGANIZATION during his seven-start pro debut last summer, the ORGANIZATION are very excited to see what PERSON can do during his GPE debut. There is a lot of ceiling here, and he has the chance to climb this list in a hurry and eventually impact the big league rotation.",-1
"In July 2016, the ORGANIZATION did some serious shopping on the international market, going heavy on GPE imports and handing out four seven-figure bonuses in the process. PERSON and PERSON landed ahead of PERSON, who got $1.9 million to sign, on the Top 30. PERSON's GPE debut in 2017 was a bit uneven, but there's still a lot to like in the young right-hander.It starts with his size, as he is a huge physical specimen at 6-foot-6. His fastball hasn't quite ticked back up to where it was when he was up to 96-97 mph shortly after signing, but there's plenty there, sitting in the 92-94 mph range and touching a bit higher. He uses his size to throw downhill with average movement, showing an early ability to get groundball outs. His curve and changeup are both developing along with his command. The ORGANIZATION think there's an above-average breaking ball in there, while his change remains a work in progress.More than anything PERSON needs to work on getting his huge frame in sync and repeating his delivery. That should lead to more consistent strike-throwing along with a refinement of his overall stuff. PERSON may be key, but pitching all year at age 20, there's plenty of time for him to figure it out.",-1
"Coming out of a ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION) program that produced future first-rounders and big leaguers PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, PERSON went undrafted in 2016 and headed to PERSON A&M. He spent his freshman year as a swingman, winning the game that sent the ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION World Series, and was one of the LOCATION's best starters the past two seasons. He outdueled 2018 No. 1 overall pick PERSON at the '18 SEC tournament, and after a junior campaign in which he posted a 2.07 ERA with 115 strikeouts over 104 2/3 innings, he became the ORGANIZATION' highest-drafted player in the past seven years when the ORGANIZATION selected him in the second round of the 2019 Draft. PERSON has effort in his delivery and uses an arm slot that varies from low- to mid-three-quarters, yet that doesn't prevent him from pounding the strike zone with three pitches. He doesn't dazzle radar guns with his 88-93 mph fastball, but it plays up because of its armside run and his ability to command it to both sides of the plate. He masterfully manipulates his low-80s slider, changing velocities and shape and demonstrating the ability to back-foot it against right-handers.Though PERSON' changeup is less reliable than his other two offerings, it features some fade and shows flashes of becoming a solid third pitch. Some scouts look at the stress with which he throws and peg him as a reliever, and he did hit 97 mph as a freshman in that role, but he has the three-pitch repertoire, control and durable frame to start, and the makeup to get the most out of his ability.",-1
"PERSON GPE has produced some sneaky good position players in recent years with PERSON (ORGANIZATION, fourth round, 2015) and PERSON (ORGANIZATION, third round, 2018). The next in line is PERSON, a 35th-round pick by the ORGANIZATION out of an PERSON high school three years ago. He's an up-the-middle player who can do a little bit of everything and who went a round later than ORGANIZATION did, signed for a below-slot $297,500 and advanced to full-season ball in his first pro summer.A left-handed hitter, PERSON employed a more contact-oriented mentality in his first two college seasons. He began driving the ball more often and had success doing so with wood bats in the ORGANIZATION last summer, and he hit for more power as a junior. With his current approach, he projects as a possible .270 hitter with 15 homers per season as a pro.PERSON's best tool is his speed, and he'll flash some plus-plus times but plays more as a plus runner. He's still learning as a basestealer and shows just average instincts in center field, so he's not getting as much out of his quickness as he can. He has a fringy arm and it's not out of the question that he could wind up in left field and develop into a Brett Gardner type.",-1
"PERSON posted a 5.20 ORGANIZATION in his first two seasons at GPE before breaking out in 2018, ranking second in ORGANIZATION Division I with a 1.23 mark and first in hits per nine innings (4.8). The ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year, he established Pride records for ORGANIZATION, consecutive innings without an earned run (49 1/3) and strikeouts in a season (108) and career (271). After matching PERSON (ORGANIZATION, 2013) as the highest Draft pick (third round) in school history and signing for a slightly over-slot $563,240, he pitched well in low Class A in his brief pro debut.PERSON's fastball plays better than its mediocre 88-93 mph velocity because he creates difficult angle with his 6-foot-5 frame and can spot his heater to both sides of the plate. While most scouting reports rated his low-80s slider ahead of his fading changeup in college, the latter was more effective in his introduction to pro ball and showed signs of becoming a plus pitch. His slider could become a solid offering if he tightens it up.Pitching in the ORGANIZATION in the summer of 2017 taught PERSON that he could compete against quality competition without lighting up radar guns, and he took off once he became more aggressive about challenging hitters. His ability to repeat his sound delivery allows him to command his pitches and he's not afraid to work inside. A potential back-of-the-rotation starter, he helps his cause with a deceptive pickoff move that nailed 17 runners in 13 starts as a GPE junior.",-1
"After logging a 5.20 ORGANIZATION in his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION, PERSON ranked second in ORGANIZATION Division I this spring at 1.23 while also finishing first in hits per nine innings (4.8). The ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year, he set ORGANIZATION records for ORGANIZATION, consecutive innings without permitting an earned run (49 1/3) and strikeouts in a single season (108) and career (271). He matched PERSON (ORGANIZATION, 2013) as the highest pick in the program's history when the ORGANIZATION took him in the third round and signed him for a slightly over-slot $563,240.PERSON succeeds more with command and angle than with pure stuff. His ability to locate his fastball on both sides of the plate and the plane his 6-foot-5 frame generates help it play better than its pedestrian 88-93 mph velocity. He also throws strikes with his solid low-80s slider and his fading changeup.Pitching in the ORGANIZATION last summer helped PERSON realize he could compete against quality competition without overpowering stuff. He has been more aggressive about challenging hitters in 2018, showing no fear for pitching inside. He picked off 17 runners in 13 starts as a junior, and his ability to shut down the running game is another facet that gives him a high ceiling as a back-of-the-rotation starter.",-1
" GPE was primarily a shortstop for his high school team in GPE who pitched only occasionally. The GPE liked his arm strength and athleticism enough to take him in the fourth round and give him an above-pick value deal of $625,000 to sign him away from heading to the ORGANIZATION of GPE. The 6-foot-2 right-hander has a long way to go, but there are building blocks to like. Currently, he has largely average stuff across the board, but there's room for growth to go along with a solid delivery and a pretty good feel for pitching, especially considering his lack of experience. His fastball sits around 90 mph right now with a little bit of sink, he can spin a decent breaking ball and there's some feel for a changeup, though that's understandably inconsistent. With his athleticism and solid delivery, the GPE believe GPE will get to PERSON average control. As GPE learns how to pitch and adds strength to his frame, all of his stuff could start ticking up as he progresses. ORGANIZATION, the GPE see some PERSON potential in GPE, with similar upside as a future starter.",-1
"The second-youngest player in the 2017 Draft class, PERSON didn't celebrate his 18th birthday until November. That youth, along with his highly projectable frame and loud but raw tools, put him firmly on the ORGANIZATION' radar, and the club was thrilled to land the GPE prep in the third round.

"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON out of the ORGANIZATION in January 2014, landing the then-16-year-old with a $350,000 bonus. After an impressive professional debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, he spent the 2015 season, his age-18 campaign, in the Class A GPE ORGANIZATION, where he continued to show an advanced bat despite missing nearly six weeks with a right thumb injury. In October during instructional league, PERSON underwent surgery to repair a broken hamate bone in his left hand. He was fully healthy by Spring Training, though, and the ORGANIZATION assigned him to the Class A Advanced PERSON to begin the season.PERSON is a physical specimen with the strength to match his size. He generates plus raw power from the right side of the plate with above-average bat speed and a surprisingly short swing, and he has natural feel for driving the ball to all fields. Though PERSON' power has translated to mostly doubles early in his career, it's easy to envision the teenager clearing more fences as he develops. His approach is understandably raw and he'll need to become more selective, but he does a good job controlling the zone for a player his age and has a knack for barreling the ball.PERSON has the arm strength for third base, but as a well-below-average runner, it will be a challenge for him to remain at the position due to his lack of range and quickness. Should he be forced off the hot corner, his middle-of-the-order bat would support a move to first base.",-1
"While the ORGANIZATION don't often dive deep into international amateur waters, they dipped their toes in to sign PERSON in January 2014. If the teenager's pro debut in the ORGANIZATION is any indication, the expenditure for PERSON' upside will be well worth it.The corner infielder more than held his own while skipping over the ORGANIZATION and playing in the States at age 17. PERSON has a big strong body and a ton of raw power from the right side of the plate. He has plenty of bat speed and has already shown the ability to drive the ball to all fields. PERSON has more than enough arm strength for third, but his lack of speed negatively impacts his range and he does need to improve his footwork. A move to first base, especially given his size, isn't out of the question.The good news is that it looks like his power bat will play perfectly well at either corner spot. PERSON might still be a ways away from the big leagues, but the payoff could be an impact, middle-of-the-order bat.",-1
"A top prospect in GPE's system since he signed for $350,000 out of the ORGANIZATION at age 16 in January 2014, PERSON has struggled to stay healthy in recent years. He missed nearly six weeks with a right thumb injury during his 2015 full-season debut and underwent surgery to repair a broken hamate bone in his left hand that fall. Though healthy for all of 2016, PERSON was overmatched as the youngest everyday player in the Class A Advanced PERSON. And his strong start to the '17 season was quickly derailed when he landed on the disabled list in April with a broken finger suffered while punching a wall.  Big and physical, PERSON generates plus raw power from the right side of the plate with his above-average bat speed and natural feel for driving the ball to all fields. He connected on 10 homers in 2016, more than doubling his combined total from the two previous years, and it doesn't take much to envision PERSON clearing even more fences as he develops. Scouts do worry about his ability to hit for average, especially after he regressed last season with his swing mechanics, plate discipline and pitch recognition.  PERSON has the arm strength for third base, but as a well-below-average runner, it will be a challenge for him to remain at the position due to his lack of range and quickness. A move down the defensive spectrum to first base appears unavoidable, though it would place even greater pressure on his offensive tools to develop.",-1

He squares the ball up well and has good strike-zone discipline for his age.  At 17, PERSON is already listed at 6-foot-3, 220 pounds, and his size may necessitate a position change.

The toolsy outfielder made his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION and would have finished fourth in the Rookie-level circuit in batting average if he had compiled enough at-bats to qualify.PERSON has already shown that he's a tough out at the plate, one with outstanding contact skills. He rarely strikes out and rose to the challenge by battling the better pitching he faced during his GPE debut. While power is never going to be a large part of his game, PERSON does need to add strength so he can continue to impact the baseball against higher levels of competition. He's a plus runner who should be able to steal bases, so an improved approach that includes drawing more walks will help. His speed helps him in the outfield, with enough range to stay in center, though he has a below-average arm.Just 19 years old, PERSON has a long way to go. PERSON strength and better plate discipline will help him reach his ceiling as a dynamic table-setter who plays up the middle.",-1

He posted a career-best .863 OPS in low Class A before slumping to a career-worst .511 OPS in his first taste of high Class A.PERSON's .240/.316/.353 line in his first four pro seasons is more a reflection of being one of the youngest players in each of his leagues than an indictment of his offensive potential. He's a switch-hitter with a line-drive stroke, a good sense of the strike zone and the bat speed and deceptive strength for double-digit home run potential. His biggest problem is that he doesn't use his legs enough at the plate and makes too much weak contact.PERSON has average speed but a quicker first step that gives him the range to stay at shortstop.

He has an advanced approach at the plate, showing excellent plate discipline and the ability to hit for average that should translate. His pitch selection improved tremendously, which in turn gave him better pitches to drive, something he did more consistently as a junior, giving him the chance to have at least average power in the future.

GPE also has flashes of above-average power. Despite not being too speedy, he can be deceptively quick and is a solid baserunner with great instincts.

He has started slowly, with two summers spent in the ORGANIZATION, but after hanging back in extended spring training in '18, he has made an impression in full-season ball. PERSON has filled out considerably since he signed, now weighing 194 pounds with his 6-foot-4 frame. That has allowed him to add more consistent velocity on his fastball, which he now throws in the 90-96 mph range, averaging 93 mph. While he had more of a curveball as an amateur, he rarely uses it, instead going to a harder slider he learned in extended spring ball that he throws 81-84 mph with good two-plane action.

After two summers in the ORGANIZATION, he took a nice step forward while pitching full-season ball for the first time, then another leap in 2019.PERSON made very good strides during extended spring training and that carried over into his 2018 ORGANIZATION debut. The big right-hander had plenty left in the tank at the end of the year, living in the 92-94 mph range and consistently up to 95 mph with his fastball, and he's been up to 97 mph consistently this season. He throws it with good sinking action to get ground-ball outs. His changeup has improved quite a bit, and while he can still throw it a bit too hard, in the 85-86 mph range, it has more movement and there's more separation between the two pitches because of his uptick in velocity. The slider is still his go-to breaking ball and it flashes plus.There could still be more in the tank as PERSON continues to fill out his 6-foot-4 frame, giving him considerable ceiling.

Regarded by scouts as one of the better prep hitters in his class, GPE furthered his reputation with a torrid start to his pro career in the ORGANIZATION, hitting .331 with 39 RBIs in 37 games before a late promotion to the GPE. With his plus bat speed and an explosive but well-balanced right-handed swing, GPE has no issues with velocity and consistently barrels the ball. His advanced approach fuels his ability to hit to all fields, and he made a lot of hard, line-drive contact from line to line during his pro debut. Those qualities lead scouts to project GPE as an above-average big league hitter, and it's possible that he could also develop plus power as he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame and adds some loft to his swing. An average runner out of the batter's box and quicker once he gets going, GPE is athletic for his size but isn't a lock at shortstop. His strong arm plays well there, though his defensive actions might be best suited for third base long term. He has the offensive profile for the position, with the potential to develop into an impactful regular who hits for both average and power.",-1
"No. 22 on MLBPipeline.com's list of the Top 30 international prospects for the 2016-17 international period, PERSON received $1 million from the ORGANIZATION at the outset of the signing period. Considered very raw at that time but loaded with potential, PERSON quickly has proved more advanced than expected this season while making his professional debut in the ORGANIZATION at age 17.To put it simply, PERSON can really run. The teenage shortstop from the ORGANIZATION has been clocked at 6.4 seconds in the 60-yard dash several times and glides around the infield on defense. Overall, PERSON has an athletic medium frame and has a quick first step on defense. He has displayed good, soft hands and proper footwork at his defensive position. PERSON also like his strong arm.In the batter's box, he has a slight upstroke swing and decent bat speed. He can turn on pitches and has shown the ability to drive the ball to the fence. He's made significant strides as a hitter since signing, and the ORGANIZATION expect continued improvement on that front as he gains experience.",-1
"There have been some who have lamented the fact that baseball keeps losing top tier athletes to football. The ORGANIZATION have done their part to reverse that trend, taking two-sport high school stars like PERSON in 2015 and PERSON in 2016. It continued in 2018 when they took PERSON, who could have kept playing both sports at FACILITY, in the middle of the first round and gave him an above pick value bonus of $4.1 million to give up football.PERSON has the potential to be an impact player on both sides of the ball, but still has a long way to go to get there. His coming out party baseball-wise came at ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION, the first time he showed he could handle quality pitching, and the bat speed that was on display then continued on through his senior season and into his pro debut. As he continues to refine his approach, he has the chance to hit for a good amount of power. His top-of-the-scale speed should allow him to wreak havoc on the basepaths and cover a ton of ground in the outfield, though he still needs to learn the nuances of basestealing and improve his reads and routes in center field.There were some encouraging signs from PERSON during his pro debut, which was cut short by a broken jaw suffered in an outfield collision. PERSON will be needed, but PERSON could be right behind PERSON and PERSON as dynamic young outfielders making it to GPE.",-1
"A two-sport standout who intrigued with his athleticism, PERSON really put his name on the map with a breakout performance last March at ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION. A four-star wide receiver recruit, PERSON could have gone on to play both sports at FACILITY, where his father PERSON is the defensive line coach. The ORGANIZATION nabbed him in the first round, at ORGANIZATION. 17 overall, and gave him an above pick value bonus of $4.1 million to walk away from football.While he looked a bit overmatched at times last summer on the showcase circuit, PERSON was up to the task of facing quality pitching at the ORGANIZATION. He made repeated hard contact with his quick right-handed swing and displayed at least average raw power. He employs a big leg kick and doesn't have much track record offensively, but he has the upside of a solid hitter with 15-20 homers per year. His best tool is his speed, which earns top-of-the-scale 80 grades from some evaluators. Just with his sheer quickness, PERSON can steal bases and cover a lot of ground in center field, and he potentially could be elite in both areas as he turns his full attention to baseball. He has fringy arm strength, which is more than playable in center, and it could improve if he got on a throwing program.PERSON' upside is as high as anyone's in this Draft class given his athleticism, raw tools and previously divided focus. It might take some time for it all to come together, but it gives the ORGANIZATION another dynamic athlete, joining prospects like PERSON, PERSON and PERSON.",-1
"The D-backs were aggressive in the international market at the start of the 2017 signing period, with PERSON the big catch, getting a seven-figure bonus. They also got PERSON, an intriguing outfield prospect in his own right, signing him out of GPE for $415,000.Just getting started on his pro career in the ORGANIZATION in 2018, PERSON is already showing a good feel to hit and an advanced approach at the plate. He is now a switch-hitter, hitting left-handed for the first time, with excellent on-base skills. His strong instincts serve him well on the bases and in center field, where he profiles well even with less-than-blazing speed.PERSON has a long way to go before it's clear what kind of player he will be. If he continues to progress, he has the chance to be a top-of-the-order type in center field.",-1
"Having already exceeded their international pool with the signing left-hander PERSON for $11 million, the ORGANIZATION proceeded to add another high-profile GPE talent to its system in PERSON, inking the 19-year-old outfielder for a reported $7 million bonus the day after he was declared a free agent by PERSON Baseball.A physical specimen, PERSON, ranked No. 8 on MLB.com's list of the Top 30 international prospects, stands out on the field for his muscular and projectable body. At the plate, the right-handed hitter combines strength and bat speed to generate easy power, and he's shown the ability to drive the ball across the entire field. Scouts believe PERSON has a chance to be a solid overall hitter, too, as he already demonstrates a polished approach in the batter's box.PERSON can play all three outfield positions and has shown good instincts. However, with speed that's a tick below average and a strong arm, he seemingly is best suited for a corner spot. PERSON might be years away from reaching the ORGANIZATION, but he has all the ingredients needed to become a prototypical right fielder at the highest level.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION blew past their allotted international bonus pool in 2016 to sign many of the top prospects, but none were bigger than GPE PERSON and PERSON. While the lefty PERSON commanded the largest bonus at $11 million, the then-19-year-old PERSON, ORGANIZATION's No. 8 international prospect at the time, received a $7 million bonus the day after he was declared a free agent by PERSON. He made his GPE debut in 2017, earning PERSON All-Star honors with PERSON Wayne.A physical specimen, PERSON stands out on the field for his muscular and projectable body. At the plate, the right-handed hitter combines strength and bat speed to generate plus power, and he's shown the ability to drive the ball out of the park across the entire field. PERSON already demonstrates a polished approach that caters to his strengths, and he projects as an average hitter, though some evaluators worry about the length and stiffness in his swing. He's played all three outfield positions, but he is a destined for an outfield corner, where his below-average speed, strong arm and power profile are all clean fits.PERSON might be years away from reaching the ORGANIZATION, but he has all the ingredients needed to become a prototypical right fielder at the highest level.",-1
"Though international players become eligible to sign at age 16, PERSON was 19 years and seven months old when he caught on with the ORGANIZATION for $10,000 in October 2016. Like many pitchers in the system, he has added significant fastball velocity since turning pro. He has picked up 5 mph this year alone after reaching full-season ball for the first time.After operating with an 89-93 mph fastball when he made his GPE debut in 2018, PERSON is now dealing at 93-97 and hitting 99. His secondary pitches are very much works in progress, however. His mid-80s slider does show some promise and he's working to gain feel for a changeup that features splitter action.While ORGANIZATION has developed PERSON as a starter to this point, his delivery and arm action are more suited for relief work. He also has yet to prove that he can provide enough strikes to work deep into games. He does have one of the more intriguing fastballs in the system, so the ORGANIZATION will give him plenty of time to figure everything else out.",-1
"Purchased from the ORGANIZATION's PERSON in a July 2015 deal worth $1.5 million, PERSON made his pro debut 11 months in a Rookie-level ORGANIZATION start that featured seven strikeouts in four scoreless innings and created a ton of buzz in the scouting community. Forearm tightness precluded him from pitching in a game again until last summer, when GPE never let him work more than five innings in 10 starts. He made his full-season debut at age 19 this April but his control quickly disintegrated to the point where the ORGANIZATION had to shut him down for a month.PERSON possesses easily the best changeup in the system, earning plus-plus grades at times because he sells it so well and it seems to disappear at the plate. He sets it up with a 93-95 mph fastball that he can push to 97 and spot on either side of the plate when he's going well. He'll also flash a plus curveball at times, though it's less consistent than his other two pitches because he uses it less often.Before he lost the ability to find the strike zone, PERSON showed some feel for adding and subtracting from his pitches. He continued to battle his control after returning in June, and it won't matter how impressive his pure stuff is if he can't throw it over the plate. His delivery has gotten out of sync and he lost confidence once his troubles snowballed.",-1
"It's unlikely that any pitcher ever created as much intrigue with a four-inning pro debut in GPE ball than PERSON did last summer. Purchased from the ORGANIZATION's PERSON in a July 2015 deal valued at $1.5 million, he made just one ORGANIZATION start last June before GPE shut him down as a precaution with forearm soreness. That lone appearance was enough for scouts inside and outside the organization to believe he has as much upside as any ORGANIZATION pitching prospect.PERSON not only has a fastball that sits at 93-95 mph and can reach 97, but he already can locate it on either side of the plate. That's not even his best weapon, a distinction that belongs to a changeup he also commands well and that many evaluators project as a double-plus offering. His breaking ball still is slurvy enough that it gets described alternately as both a curve and a slider, though he does have some feel for spin.While PERSON isn't very physical or projectable, he has an exceedingly quick arm. He has advanced command for a teenager, as well as the aptitude to add and subtract from his pitches. He'll need time to develop but could become the homegrown frontline starter the ORGANIZATION have been looking for.",-1
"PERSON originally signed with the ORGANIZATION's PERSON before the ORGANIZATION purchased his rights in a July 2015 deal valued at $1.5 million. He looked spectacular in his GPE debut in 2016, striking out seven in four one-hit innings. He came down with soreness in his forearm shortly afterward, so GPE decided to shut him down until instructional league as a precaution.PERSON doesn't have a ton of projection remaining in his 6-foot-1, 185-pound frame, but he doesn't need it because his present stuff already is impressive. He operates with a 93-95 mph fastball and can reach 97, showing the ability to throw it for strikes on both sides of the plate. He's still refining his secondary pitches but already flashes a well above-average changeup and a solid slider.More advanced than the typical teenaged pitcher, PERSON has good command of his pitches and can add and subtract from them. He's years away from PERSON at this point, but he has the upside of a frontline starter if he can stay healthy.",-1
"The cousin of ORGANIZATION third basemen PERSON, PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION for $250,000 in 2016 and made his GPE debut the next year following a short stint in his native ORGANIZATION. He impressed evaluators with his defense at shortstop, offensive potential and overall feel for the game in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, and the ORGANIZATION packaged him with flame-thrower PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in December to land 2017 ORGANIZATION MVP Giancarlo PERSON. One of the youngest everyday players in the Class A GPE ORGANIZATION on 2018 Opening Day, GPE has continued to show tools and skills that bely his age. GPE has the requisite defensive tools to stick at shortstop. He's an athletic and agile defender there, one with soft hands, slick footwork and arm strength that has already improved in the professional ranks. Though he stands out more for his glove than bat, GPE is no slouch at the plate, showing good feel to hit and some power potential from the left-handed box. His discerning eye at the plate and patient approach translate to strong on-base skills, and he knows how to use his above-average speed once on base.GPE projects as a glove-first shortstop who can also hit for a respectable average while adding value with his baserunning. It may not be the sexiest of profiles, but it's one that could make him a big leaguer for many years.",-1
"A cousin of PERSON, PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION for $250,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2016. After his first season in pro ball, the PERSON acquired him along with PERSON and right-hander PERSON for PERSON in December 2017. He held his own as one of the second-youngest regulars (age 18) in the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION during his first season in the ORGANIZATION system and even made a two-game cameo in high Class A.In sharp contrast to his cousin, ORGANIZATION stands out much more for his glove than his bat. He has advanced instincts at shortstop, along with quick feet and solid arm strength that has improved since he turned pro. He was shut down at the end of the 2018 season with shoulder fatigue and missed nearly three months this summer with a forearm strain, though neither should be a concern going forward. ORGANIZATION is one of the best contact hitters in the system and employs an unusually disciplined approach for his age. He has yet to drive the ball with his flat left-handed swing and slender frame, so the PERSON had him focus on strength training during the offseason and he added 20 pounds. He has some sneaky pop but never will be much of a slugger, so he's looking to make better use of his plus speed.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION spent four of their first five picks in the 2015 Draft on right-handers, concluding with PERSON in the fifth round. The first player selected from GPE in 2015, he signed for $330,000. Though he lacks physicality at 6 feet and 170 pounds, PERSON has intriguing arm strength. His fastball sits at 88-91 mph and can reach 93 with more projection remaining. His curveball also has the makings of a solid pitch, though he'll have to upgrade his changeup.PERSON is relatively polished for a high schooler and had little trouble breaking into pro ball in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. He allowed just one run in his first five outings while demonstrating feel for throwing strikes and pounding the bottom of the zone.",-1
"GPE was the highest-drafted player out PERSON in 2015, going to the ORGANIZATION in the fifth round and signing for $330,000. He then made a strong impression during his pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, posting a 0.96 WHIP with 31 strikeouts in 34 1/3 innings while holding opposing hitters to a .198 average.At 6-feet, 170 pounds, GPE is an undersized right-hander who lacks physicality. He has good arm strength, however, with a fastball that sits 88-91 mph and can reach 93 with room to add a few more ticks. His current breaking ball has the makings of an above-average pitch, and the ORGANIZATION have had him working on a true curveball this season. He has a decent changeup and throws strikes with his entire arsenal.GPE may not involve much projection, but he's distinctly polished for a recent prep PERSON pick. His background as an infielder shows in his athleticism on the mound, and it's for that reason some scouts believe the right-hander could move through the Minors at an accelerated pace.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON, an undersized infielder, out of GPE back in July 2013, and after a relatively ordinary debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2014, he started what would become a trend in his career by hitting over .300 in a return ORGANIZATION engagement. He turned the trick again during his GPE debut in 2016 and again in his full-season debut a year ago when he was dealt to the Phillies in the ORGANIZATION trade last July.PERSON doesn't have loud tools, but he does have a very good feel to hit, with low strikeout rates, that has led to a .312 career average heading into the 2018 season, something he didn't continue to do in the ORGANIZATION State League in 2018. He's continuing to work on adding strength, something he'll need so he can impact the baseball more consistently as he moves up the ladder. An average runner, PERSON is aggressive on the basepaths and likes to steal, though he gets caught too frequently. He's moved all over the infield for much of his career to date and while he played more shortstop than anywhere else the last two seasons, the Phillies plan to go back to having him play there, second and third.PERSON is the kind of player who won't wow you the first time you see him, but over time you'll notice his feel for the game and his ability to do the little things. PERSON strength will make him a more interesting prospect, but he at least can be a solid-hitting utilityman in the future.",-1
"Following two seasons in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION, PERSON opened eyes in his GPE debut last summer. He led the Rookie-level PERSON in hits (98) and contact rate (92 percent) while ranking second in batting (.367). In addition to his hitting ability, he also impressed with his maturity and energy as one of the youngest regulars (age 19) in the league. He was replicating his performance in his full-season debut when he was sent to the Phillies in GPE's PERSON deal.PERSON has a very disciplined approach at the plate, using a controlled right-handed stroke and rarely deviating from his plan to hit line drives from gap to gap. He's not very big, so while he can add some strength he still may top out at 10 homers per season. An average runner, he stole 55 bases in 199 games during his first three pro seasons but succeeded in just 63 percent of his attempts.PERSON played all four infield positions in the ORGANIZATION, spending most of his time at third base before shifting to shortstop in 2016. His internal clock helps him make plays, though his merely average quickness and arm strength make it unlikely he'll stay at short in the long run. He profiles best as a sweet-swinging utilityman and could be a regular at second base if his bat continues to be as good as it has looked the last two seasons.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION were thrilled to be able to sign PERSON, an exciting infielder from GPE, for close to $5 million at the end of the 2016-17 signing period. Then they had to wait 10 months to see him play in real competition, after he hadn't played for quite some time after defecting, challenging him with an assignment to full-season ball. After stumbling out of the gate, fans got to see what the fuss was all about in the second half of 2018.Despite some concerns of pushing him too hard, PERSON was skipped over rookie ball and sent straight to the ORGANIZATION with PERSON. The ORGANIZATION were glad that they did. After he struggled at the plate the first three months, PERSON started to figure it out in the second half, hitting for average and showing some power, with five of his six homers for the season. He has shown a balanced set-up at the plate and the ability to send line drives to all fields, though he'll have to continue to refine his overall approach. He did deal with a left shoulder injury as well, but it was not too serious.PERSON's plus speed and athleticism allows him to have very good range, and he has more than enough arm for the position. He largely played second base for the GPE junior national team but played a majority of his games at shortstop for PERSON and the reviews have been good. The organization feels he has the makings of a solid Major League shortstop, with a caveat. If he continues to grow into his 6-foot-2 frame, he could outgrow the position and need to be moved.",-1
"GPE splurging on an expensive sports car, but not getting to drive it on the open road for a year. That's kind of where the ORGANIZATION are with PERSON, the exciting GPE infielder they signed for close to $5 million right at the end of the 2016-17 international signing period. Needless to say, they're excited to see what he can do in competition.PERSON is a plus athlete who largely played second base for the GPE junior national team, but has been getting very good reviews at shortstop by people like PERSON within the organization as they've seen him get work in at the premium position. His plus speed allows him to have very good range and he has more than enough arm for the position. In the past, he has shown a balanced set-up at the plate and the ability to send line drives to all fields. It's still gap power right now, but there should be more as he fills out his 6-foot-2 frame, and he attended the ORGANIZATION' strength camp over the winter to help.The ORGANIZATION have peeked under the hood and really like PERSON's engine. Now it's time to let him loose on PERSON competition and see how fast he can move.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION continued to be at the forefront of aggressive signings of GPE players when they signed PERSON for close to $5 million in June. PERSON, a past member of the GPE junior national team, joins shortstop PERSON and PERSON as big-ticket GPE prospects to join the organization as part of the ORGANIZATION' 2016-17 international signing period spending spree.A 6-foot-2 middle infielder, PERSON played a lot of second base for the GPE national team, but the ORGANIZATION believe he has the goods to stick at shortstop long-term. His plus speed -- the ORGANIZATION have him with 6.4 and 6.5 times in the 60 -- allows him to cover plenty of ground and while he'll have to break the habit of a lowered arm slot and flips to first, he has shown more than enough arm for the left side of the infield. At the plate, he has a balanced set-up and makes hard contact to all fields. PERSON will battle through at-bats with an advanced approach at the plate and mostly shows gap power right now, but his athletic 6-foot-3 frame looks like it should add strength. With that should come at least some over-the-fence pop.PERSON will spend the rest of this season in the ORGANIZATION. He should join his fellow countryman in the GPE for instructs in the fall and will make his official GPE debut in 2018.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION have had some success mining the considerable talent in GPE over the years, drafting PERSON in 2010 and PERSON in 2012. They got PERSON in the second round of the 2016 Draft and after struggling out of the gate, he went on to be an GPE ORGANIZATION All-Star in 2017 and have a solid full-season debut last year, making it seem more likely that he will join his island-mates in GSP has one of the best pure swings in the organization with the chance to be a plus hitter down the line thanks to outstanding bat-to-ball skills and plate discipline from the right side of the plate. He rarely strikes out and can spray the ball to all fields. He's shown more power than expected, with most of his over-the-fence damage coming to his pull side. He's played mostly second and third, and should continue to see an even split between the two spots going forward, though the ORGANIZATION got him a little time at shortstop in 2018, where his range is limited, but his hands and arm work fine.PERSON's tweener profile limits his ceiling a bit, and he might be a utilityman when all is said and done as a result. But if his bat keeps progressing, he could hit his way into a regular spot in a big league lineup.",-1
"Back in 2012, PERSON had a pair of first-round picks, headlined by ORGANIZATION. 1 overall selection PERSON. The island didn't have another selection in the top two rounds until 2016 when the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the first round and the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the second. PERSON scuffled during his pro debut, but bounced back as one of the better hitting prospects in the GPE League in 2017, finishing tied for the home run lead.PERSON was really able to settle in and adjust to pro ball in his second summer after looking unprepared in the ORGANIZATION League the year prior. He showed off outstanding bat-to-ball skills, striking out less than 10 percent of the time while showing good overall plate discipline. For that reason, many feel he'll be an above-average hitter in time, one who can drive the ball to all fields and approach PERSON average power. He's not much of a runner, but he has the chance to be an average defender at second. He's also played some third base and he might move around a bit defensively.The ORGANIZATION feel they saw the player they drafted in 2017 and there is excitement to see how those adjustments play in full-season ball. Regardless of where he plays defensively, it's his offensive upside that should help him move up the ladder.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION blew well past their allotted bonus pool for the 2016-17 international to sign a trio of promising 16-year-old shortstops in GPE, PERSON and PERSON, who signed for $950,000 on July 12. But while PERSON and PERSON may be regarded as the more advanced of the trio, it's the ORGANIZATION who requires the most projection. PERSON's compact swing and present feel for going the other way gives him a chance to hit for average, and he should show more power as he grows into his lean and athletic frame. He also shows good instincts on the bases, though his speed is only solid-to-average. On defense is where PERSON truly shines. He has good hands and fluid actions at shortstop, as well as confidence that allow him to make challenging plays appear easy. He has shown good footwork at an early age and that part of his game will improve as he develops and receives daily instruction in pro ball. He'll need time to develop, but PERSON shows the makings of becoming an everyday shortstop in the big leagues.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION made a haul on up-the-middle talents during the 2016-17 international period, signing a trio of promising 16-year-old shortstops in GPE, PERSON and PERSON, the latter of whom signed for $950,000 out of GPE on July 12. While PERSON and GPE have already emerged as the gems of that group, PERSON, with his slick defense and remaining projection, continues to excite club officials. PERSON's plus defense is his calling card. He shows good hands, fluid actions and plus arm strength at shortstop, as well as confidence that allow him to make challenging plays appear routine. At the plate, PERSON's compact swing and present feel for going the other way gives him a chance to hit for average, and he should develop some power as he grows into his lean and athletic frame. He also shows good instincts on the bases, though his speed is only average.Playing on the same infield as PERSON and GPE in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, PERSON saw time at second and third base in addition to his work as a shortstop. Though he's a clean fit at the latter position, a utility infield role could be PERSON's ticket to the ORGANIZATION.",-1
"Angels pitching prospects fall into two categories, for the most part. There are the pitchability guys, with PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON leading the charge. Then there are the higher upside guys, led by PERSON. PERSON, after a very strong GPE debut in 2017 in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION and PERSON, fits firmly into the latter camp.PERSON, signed for the modest sum of $70,000 in March 2016, has one of the most electric arms in the system. His fastball averaged just over 93 mph in 2017 and touched 96-97 mph at times, and there's reason to believe there could be more in the tank as he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame. His fastball-curve combination is one of the best two-pitch combinations in the organization, as PERSON can really spin his breaking ball, which flashes plus at times. His changeup is his third pitch, but there is confidence it can eventually be an average offering.PERSON has already put on good weight and strength, leading to the extra velocity that showed up in 2017. He has a very good delivery that he just needs to work on repeating more consistently, which should lead to better overall command. All the ingredients are there, with patience mixed in, for PERSON to grow into at least a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"There are international signings that make a huge splash in terms of huge bonus figures. Then there are those who sign for less and look like a bargain deal with a strong start to their career. PERSON fits the latter category, signing for $70,000 in March 2016 and then making a strong GPE debut in 2017, earning a promotion from the ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION in the process.PERSON is an intriguing combination of stuff and projection. The 6-foot-3 right-hander currently throws his fastball in the 92-94 mph range, occasionally touching 95, and there could very well be more in the tank as he fills out his frame. The teenager can really spin a curveball, and with some feeling it could eventually be a plus pitch. PERSON's changeup is his third pitch, but he has feel for it and it has the chance to be a third average offering. He's typically around the strike zone and has done a job getting ground-ball outs in his nascent pro career.A good arm action and a clean and repeatable delivery give PERSON a better chance to develop from a pure power guy into a more complete pitcher. He might have a ways to go, but the ORGANIZATION are thrilled with the progress PERSON has made so far.",-1
"PERSON signed for just $70,000 in March 2016 and based on his upside alone, that might already be a bargain. After PERSON's stellar GPE debut in '17, the ORGANIZATION pushed PERSON to full-season ball after extended spring training in 2018, where the teenager struggled at first, but finished relatively strongly.PERSON screams projectability and high ceiling, and he's starting to put his considerable tools together on the mound. His electric fastball will touch 97-98 mph and there's still room for more consistent velocity as he grows into his 6-foot-3 frame. He's always been able to spin his breaking ball, but he improved the consistency in throwing it effectively as it trends towards being a plus pitch. The ORGANIZATION pushed him to throw his changeup more, and he did it 15 percent of the time in 2018, and it took a big step forward as a result, showing a much better feel for the off-speed pitch.While PERSON's walk rate spiked in 2018, there is confidence he'll get to average command and control eventually thanks to a very athletic delivery. All he needs are innings and the gloves should come off a bit in 2019, with a chance for him to make a nice leap up this list.",-1
"The GPE system is loaded with sweet-swinging middle infielders, including three from their 2017 international class in GPE PERSON and ORGANIZATION and PERSON. The nephew of 16-year big leaguer PERSON, PERSON signed for $400,000. He had no problem adapting to pro pitching in his 2018 debut and has continued to hit in his first foray into the GPE this summer.PERSON lacks physicality but make repeated hard contact from the left side of the plate. Though he won't ever be a slugger, he can drive balls to the gaps and his first two professional homers went to the opposite field. He possesses average speed and is aggressive on the bases.PERSON should be able to stay at shortstop with his quick first step, dependable hands and solid arm. While PERSON and GPE have higher offensive ceilings, PERSON may be the best defender of the trio. PERSON's surplus of young shortstops means they all see time at other positions, and he has proven capable at second and third base as well.",-1
"PERSON has long stood out for his defensive chops at shortstop, but he also improved offensively in each of his three seasons at ORGANIZATION, culminating with a junior campaign in which he finished second among the ORGANIZATION Division I leaders in average (.402), hits (108), runs (85) and triples (10). When the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the fourth round in June, he became the second Aggies player in as many years to be selected in the round and the first position player from the school to go in the top five rounds since the ORGANIZATION took outfielder PERSON in the fifth back in 2016.PERSON's best quality is his ability to stay at shortstop long-term. He has really good hands and first-step quickness to go along with enough arm to stick at the premium position. The right-handed hitter has a solid approach at the plate with very good bat-to-ball skills that yield a lot of contact. He should be able to hit for average at the next level, though the power he has shown is a bit of a hitter-friendly environment and conference mirage.A bit undersized, PERSON doesn't have loud tools but can do a little bit of everything on the field. But as someone who receives high marks for work ethic and leadership skills to go along with his defensive chops and contact skills, he could be an overachiever who surprises in the pro ranks.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION took catchers with their first two picks in 2018, signing PERSON for $2,815,900 in the first round and PERSON for an over-slot $1,497,500 in the second.

He played through an elbow issue this spring that prevented him from catching for a month and limited him to four innings on the mound, where he has been clocked up to 100 mph.PERSON has an aggressive right-handed swing that generates uncommon bat speed and well above-average raw power. While his max-effort approach didn't result in excessive strikeouts at the juco level, his lack of patience could be exploited in pro ball. He did prove that his pop can play with wood bats and against better competition by ranking fifth in the ORGANIZATION with six homers last summer.PERSON left scouts skeptical that he could catch when they saw him as a freshman, but he cleaned up his defense this spring and now projects as at least an adequate receiver. Though his cannon arm is an asset, he needs to improve the accuracy of his throws. While he can dazzle radar guns, his violent delivery makes it unlikely he would hold up as a full-time pitcher.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION used their first two 2018 Draft picks on catchers with different profiles in 2018, a polished athlete (PERSON) in the first round and a raw slugger (PERSON) in the second. The consensus top junior college prospect after turning down the ORGANIZATION as a 36th-rounder in 2017, he slammed 37 homers in two seasons at ORGANIZATION (GPE) CC. He also reached 100 mph with his fastball as a reliever for the ORGANIZATION, though elbow issues limited him to four innings and prevented him for catching for a month as a sophomore.Extremely aggressive at the plate, PERSON has well above-average bat speed, strength and raw power. While his approach has yet to result in excessive strikeouts, pro pitchers exploited it and held him homerless and to a lot of weak contact in his 30-game debut last summer. He had shown that his pop will play with wood bats and against better competition when he ranked fifth in the ORGANIZATION with six homers in 2017.Though PERSON improved significantly behind the plate from his freshman year to his sophomore year at ORGANIZATION, he still requires more polish to become a dependable receiver. Despite his pure arm strength, he threw out just nine percent of basestealers in his first taste of pro ball and won't be able to control the running game until he improves his throwing accuracy. Pitching is less of a fallback than it might seem because he has a violent delivery that would make it difficult to keep him healthy.",-1

ORGANIZATIONrmally a third baseman, he moved to shortstop in the second half of his junior season and sparked PERSON to its best finish ever (tied for third at the ORGANIZATION). The second first-round pick in school history, he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $4.4 million as the ORGANIZATION. 8 overall choice.One of the best all-around hitters in the 2019 Draft, PERSON has a controlled approach and a sound right-handed stroke. He routinely barrels balls to all fields, doesn't sell out for power and has the bat speed and strength to produce 25 or more homers per season. He controls the strike zone and has no holes in his offensive game.Though PERSON is a below-average runner, he has enough athleticism and instincts to make plays at third base. He won't play shortstop in pro ball but upgraded the ORGANIZATION defensively when he moved there. He has reliable hands and more than enough arm strength for the hot corner.",-1
"A two-way standout in high school, PERSON garnered PERSON player of the year honors as a senior and was one of the more impressive all-around athletes available in the 2016 Draft. The ORGANIZATION liked him more as a hitter and selected him with the 13th overall pick, then lured him away from a ORGANIZATION State commitment with a $2.6 million bonus. He overcame a sluggish start in his full-season debut the next year and ultimately finished on a high note, hitting .296/.350/.415 with 24 extra-base hits and 14 steals over his final 72 games. The performance led to high expectations for PERSON's 2018 campaign, though he was unable to build upon that progress in the ORGANIZATION State League, where his feel to hit backed up and resulted in below-average production. PERSON's athleticism and physical tools suggest he'll eventually make an impact at the plate, but right now he's still figuring out what type of hitter he is. He knows how to create leverage through the hitting zone and has added some loft since signing, though, so far, it hasn't yet translated to any uptick in usable power. But even as he's scuffled at the plate, PERSON has worked to improve his approach and become more selective. That progress was evident in 2018, as he trimmed his strikeout rate by nearly 3 percent from the previous year while simultaneously improving his walk rate from 8.3 to 10.3 percent. It gives him a solid foundation for further offensive development, and club officials are still bullish about PERSON's potential to hit for average and power. After struggling at third base during his pro debut, PERSON was shifted to center field and immediately proved a natural, covering huge amounts of ground with his plus speed and long, graceful strides. He's developed into the best defensive outfielder in the system and looks like a lock to stick in center field, where his offensive profile offers the most value.",-1
"After starting at third base as a freshman on PERSON's 2017 College World Series runners-up, PERSON was supposed to take over at shortstop but a stress reaction in a lumbar vertebra limited him to just six games as a sophomore. He returned in 2019 and showed he was completely healthy by leading the ORGANIZATION in all three slash categories (.346/.433/.533) and in stolen bases (20). He signed with the ORGANIZATION for $976,700 as a second-round pick.PERSON isn't flashy but does a lot of things well. He makes consistent contact from the left side of the plate, using the entire field and managing the strike zone. He has solid raw power and drives the ball enough to hit 15 or more homers on an annual basis, and he also has solid to plus speed and knows how to use it on the bases.PERSON's instincts also are apparent on defense, giving him a chance to stay at shortstop even if many scouts project him as a second baseman in the Majors. He provides steady glovework at shortstop with reliable hands and enough arm to make the necessary throws. He may not have a true plus tool, but he has no obvious holes in his game and should become at least a utilityman.",-1
"PERSON entered 2018 as a candidate to go in the early rounds of the ORGANIZATION, but his stock dipped early in his junior season at ORGANIZATION when he let the pressure get to him and his swing got out of whack. He recovered to go on a tear as the ORGANIZATION approached, hitting his way into the second round and a $1.1 million bonus from the ORGANIZATION. After his steady pro debut, PERSON swapped him to the ORGANIZATION in January for second-base prospect PERSON, who had just been acquired from the ORGANIZATION along with a 2019 Competitive Balance A ORGANIZATION pick in exchange for PERSON and left-handed pitching prospect Reiver Sanmartin.PERSON took off once he smoothed out his right-handed stroke and took a more direct path to the ball. He's at his best when he tries to hit line drives to all fields, and while he isn't a power hitter, he has enough pop to produce 12-15 homers per year as a pro. PERSON has an extremely patient approach and a knack for stealing bases.Scouts give PERSON solid-to-plus grades for his speed, yet there's mixed opinion on whether he can stick in center field at the next level. It's essential that he does so to profile as a regular, because he doesn't have the power to profile on a corner. PERSON' below-average arm will push him to left field if he can't stay in center.",-1
"PERSON was well known to scouts before his senior year at ORGANIZATION (GPE), but his projectability stood out more than his present stuff and most figured he wouldn't get drafted early enough to divert him from a GPE A&M commitment. That changed when he hit 97 mph in his first appearance of the year, a February scrimmage against PERSON and highly touted right-hander PERSON, and he continued to improve his ORGANIZATION stock en route to a second-round selection by the ORGANIZATION, who signed him for above-slot value at $2.15 million.PERSON has gotten noticeably stronger, adding at least 10 pounds to his 6-foot-2 frame, and dropped his arm slot from high three-quarters to three-quarters. Those changes increased the velocity and movement on his fastball, which previously sat around 90 mph but ranged from 90-97 with armside run all spring. His curveball can overmatch hitters as well, residing in the low 80s with 12-6 break when he stays on top of it.Though PERSON's changeup isn't as effective as his other two pitches, he'll flash some solid ones with fade and tumble. He already shows the aptitude to work both sides of the plate and all four quadrants of the strike zone. He still has the room to add another 15 pounds and scouts rave about his makeup, so he could continue to get better.",-1

Though he received consideration in both roles, the ORGANIZATION liked him more as a hitter, so much so that they selected him with the 13th overall pick and gave him $2.6 million to forgo his ORGANIZATION State commitment.

His left-handed swing is both quick and controlled, and he knows how to create leverage through the hitting zone with his long arms to generate considerable raw power, even if it is yet to manifest during games. The same bat path leads to quite a bit of swing-and-miss -- his 144 strikeouts in 2017 ranked seventh among PERSON hitters -- though he is athletic enough to make the necessary adjustments to his swing in the coming years. Once he's done so, it doesn't take much to envision him hitting for both average and power. The ORGANIZATION are confident in PERSON's abilities as a hitter and see the sky as his ceiling given the remaining physical projection in his ultra-athletic frame.

But the ORGANIZATION liked him more as a hitter, so much so that they selected him with the 13th overall pick in June, and then gave him $2.6 million to forego his commitment to PERSON. The ORGANIZATION also signed PERSON's older brother PERSON, a first baseman out of ORGANIZATION, after drafting him in the 13th round.For as good as he is on the mound, it's hard to ignore what PERSON brings to the table as a position player. He can be streaky at the plate but his quick, controlled left-handed swing and the leverage in his long frame produce considerable raw power. He also has plus speed and arm strength, which should translate into solid defense at third base or in center field.As a pitcher, the athletic right-hander exhibited a loose arm and a relatively clean delivery. He operated at 91-93 mph and hit the mid-90s with his fastball, and he also showed the makings of a solid slider as well as some feel for a sinking changeup.

PERSON would later sign for $1 million, slightly below his slot's value, and he put forth a strong display in GPE ball, batting .253/.354/.440 with seven home runs.PERSON was a bit of a high-risk, high-reward high school hitter. Big, strong and physical, he has tremendous raw power that allows him to launch balls a long way. The rest of his game is a bit raw, though he does show some feel to hit and isn't just a kid trying to pull everything out of the park. While he's not a speedster, he runs pretty well for his size. He makes good and accurate throws from the outfield with his average arm, and he's a capable defender, though he needs to polish his reads and routes. A calm, quiet kid, he gets high marks for his makeup.PERSON is the kind of high school player scouts can dream on, with the potential to be a run-producing right fielder, in a ORGANIZATION kind of mold, when all is said and done.

He didn't use his changeup much in college but made some progress with it in his pro debut and the ORGANIZATION believe it could become a solid third offering.The athleticism that made PERSON a shortstop also allows him to pound the strike zone with his fastball.

"An older international prospect whom the ORGANIZATION signed at age 19 in January 2016, PERSON was originally viewed as an organizational roster filler based on his defensive merits. But the GPE catcher proved a more complete player than initially thought during his pro debut, showing feel to hit and power potential in the ORGANIZATION, and has continued to make strides offensively while incrementally climbing through the ORGANIZATION' system. After a solid first full season at ORGANIZATION A GPE, PERSON moved up to ORGANIZATION A Advanced Palm Beach and garnered midseason PERSON All-Star honors in 2019. PERSON's abilities behind the plate are obvious. He does a good job controlling the running game with his plus, accurate arm, and has been praised by evaluators for his catch-and-throw skills, with many noting his consistent footwork and quick release. He moves well in spite of his stocky frame, and is regarded as a good receiver and framer who also knows how to handle a pitching staff. Offensively, PERSON employs an aggressive approach from the right side of the plate, with a knack for making consistent contact to all field fields to go along with some pull-side raw power. PERSON appears ticketed for backup role at the highest level if he can continue to make strides on both sides of the ball, and there's a non-zero chance that he'll achieve such a role based simply on his defensive chops.",-1

His pro debut in 2018 in the ORGANIZATION, when he posted a .929 ORGANIZATION, has the organization very excited to see what he can do state side.There might not be a prospect with more upside, albeit with risk, in the ORGANIZATION' system than PERSON. He has the chance to be an impact run-producing bat, one who hits for average and power. He has an advanced approach at the plate, especially given his age, and has displayed excellent raw power from the get-go. PERSON has changed tremendously physically -- in a good way -- since he signed and is now a physical beast, one the organization thinks might have 70 raw power. While he might lose a step as he continues to mature, he's athletic enough for a corner outfield spot with an arm suitable for right.At one point, there was some concern PERSON would be the kind of large-framed prospect who would have to watch his weight. He's both physically and mentally developed over the offseason with the chance for him to make a huge leap forward during his GPE debut in 2019.",-1
"With his big and athletic body, along with his projectable frame and tools, it's easy to see why PERSON ranked as ORGANIZATION's No. 9 prospect for the 2017-18 international signing period. The ORGANIZATION certainly agreed with that assessment, as they inked the 16-year-old GPE outfielder for $1.75 million on July 2.PERSON has a chance to be a special hitter, one who projects to hit for average and already shows big raw power during batting practice. PERSON does have a pre-pitch waggle in the batter's box that can get his timing out of sync at times and results in some swing-and-miss, but his advanced approach at the plate and his overall bat speed helps solve some of the issues caused by his developing batting mechanics. Overall, he has the ability to drive the ball to all fields and he consistently makes hard contact.On defense, PERSON profiles as an everyday right fielder because of his solid defensive skills and strong arm. His offensive profile is a clean fit at the position, and scouts believe PERSON has the potential to be a middle-of-the-order type of run producer at maturity.",-1

Unlike many young pitchers of that size, however, PERSON has a very good feel for pitching and how to command his developing three-pitch mix. Using a high three-quarter slot, PERSON fills up the strike zone with a fastball in the 91-95 mph range, thrown with excellent extension, and a pitch that should have more in the tank as he matures. When he signed with the ORGANIZATION, PERSON didn't have a breaking ball, but he has quickly gotten a good feel for a slider that has the chance to be an out pitch in the future. His changeup is below-average right now, but with his feel for pitching, the ORGANIZATION are confident it will come on as a third effective offering.PERSON' size and plus command all point to a future as a strike-throwing starting pitcher.

Unlike many young pitchers of that size, however, he has a very good delivery and knows how to command his developing three-pitch mix.

"ORGANIZATION was committed to ORGANIZATION before the ORGANIZATION, who were impressed by his all-around athleticism and projectability while at ORGANIZATION (Fla.) HS, took him in the 11th round of the 2017 Draft and signed him for $125,000. He made a strong impression during his professional debut and advanced to the Class A Short PERSON York-Penn League in 2018. The ORGANIZATION were pleased with his development and gave him a full-season assignment at age 20 to open 2019. ORGANIZATION has a good feel for what he wants to do at the plate, as he consistently works deep counts while remaining aggressive on pitches in the zone. He employs a short, line-drive-producing swing from the right side and generally does a good job of staying inside the ball so as to hit to all fields. He doesn't offer much in the way of power but does have some gap pop that could translate to home runs as he adds physical strength. ORGANIZATION has an excellent eye at the plate, recognizes pitches well and doesn't have much swing-and-miss or strikeout tendencies in his game. ORGANIZATION's athleticism along with his above-average speed and arm strength enable him to play all three outfield positions, though his defensive profile is stretched a bit thin in center and has led to more time at both corner spots early in his career. He'll need to hit for more power to profile as an everyday guy in either right or left field, but the tools and skill sets are there for ORGANIZATION to potentially develop into a solid bench player.",-1
"Lenoir-Rhyne University in GPE, GPE, is a small Division II school that has yet to produce a big league player. It has produced a dozen draftees, with GPE one of two Bears to get selected in 2018. An All-Conference performer who hit close to .400 as a junior, the speedy GPE played his way to full-season Rome during his pro debut last summer and opened the 2019 season back in the LOCATION League.GPE's speed is clearly his carrying tool. It's close to top of the scale, with some evaluators putting an 80 on it. He's already shown the ability to use it well on the basepaths and should continue to be a serious basestealing threat. That, combined with his solid plate discipline, has worked well in the leadoff spot at the outset of his pro career. While he's never going to be a big home run threat, there is some raw pop to tap into and he consistently shows the ability to barrel up the baseball from the right side of the plate. He has a fringy arm, but it's enough for center field, where his speed gives him the chance to stay long term.At 5-foot-8, GPE is accustomed to proving doubters wrong. He'll have to prove himself at every level as an undersized player from a smaller program, but he's just the type of player that's tough to bet against, with perhaps a career as a backup who can fill in at all three outfield spots the most realistic outcome.",-1
"A mainstay on the high school showcase circuit, PERSON kicked his game up a notch in his senior season opener, reaching 95 mph with his fastball during an 18-strikeout perfect game. He looked like a top-three-rounds pick early in the spring, but his curveball regressed as the ORGANIZATION drew closer. The ORGANIZATION ended up taking PERSON in the fifth round and signed the ORGANIZATION commit for $327,1000.PERSON' fastball has parked in the low 90s all spring and he should add more velocity once he adds muscle to his skinny 6-foot-3 frame. He works from an overhand slot that creates downhill plane but not much life on his four-seamer. He has flashed a solid curveball in the past but it devolved into a mid-70s slurve this spring.PERSON has deceptive arm speed and fade with a changeup that may have more upside than his breaking ball. He has a quick arm but also a deep plunge in the back of his delivery that affects the consistency and command of his pitches. He'll continue to develop as a starter whether he turns pro this summer or attends college, though he might deal in the mid-90s as a reliever once he gets stronger.",-1
"Largely unknown before his high school senior season, PERSON attracted scouts to PERSON this spring amid reports that he was hitting 96 mph with his fastball and 86 mph with his slider. One of the biggest pop-up guys in the 2015 Draft, he ultimately went in the third round and signed for $300,000.Though PERSON can reach the mid 90s, he doesn't maintain that velocity and often works at 88-92 mph with his fastball. His slider flashes potential as a second plus pitch, but he threw it too much as an amateur and it often devolved into a softer slurve.PERSON also was a star quarterback at ORGANIZATION, and his athleticism and frame bode well for him remaining a starter. In order to stick in the rotation, he'll need to find more consistency with his fastball and slider, develop a changeup and refine his control and command.",-1
"One of the biggest pop-up guys in the 2015 Draft, GPE was a two-sport standout at ORGANIZATION in GPE, GPE, who was better known for his exploits on the gridiron than diamond.

He signed for $300,000 as a third-round pick and had an excellent pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, capping his season with a 10-strikeout performance over six innings in the ORGANIZATION playoffs. Though he can hit the mid 90s, GPE works more in the 90-93 mph range with his fastball and already displays feel for pitching to both sides of the plate. His heater is more dynamic than the velocity suggests, too, as his fast arm and low three-quarters slot give it excellent sinking action that generates a ton of ground balls. The slider is relatively new to his arsenal but shows the makings of a second plus pitch, and his changeup is understandably raw due to a lack of experience.GPE's athleticism is obvious on the mound, and it's easy to envision him growing into his projectable frame in the coming years. His outstanding sinker should keep the door open for him as a starter and reliever, but he'll need to refine his slider, develop a changeup and refine his control and command to stick in the rotation.",-1

"PERSON had the best all-around tools among college players in the 2019 Draft, but he also was one of the biggest enigmas in his class.

The ORGANIZATION wound up getting him in the supplemental first round at ORGANIZATION. 35 overall and signed him at the deadline for $2,115,000.His bat speed, strength and the leverage in his 6-foot-4 frame give him well above-average raw power that outshines that of ORGANIZATION Bleday, PERSON's first-round pick, taken ORGANIZATION. 4 overall. How usable it will be remains to be seen because while he has a sound left-handed stroke, he has an extremely patient approach that borders on passive and leads to him hitting behind in the count too often. With his plus speed and aptitude to steal bases, he has 30-30 upside if he develops consistency at the plate.After playing mostly left field as a freshman and a lot of first base as a sophomore, PERSON looked solid in center field last spring. With his quickness and strong arm, he's capable of playing anywhere in the outfield. PERSON praise his makeup as much as his physical gifts.",-1
"PERSON was the top prep prospect in PERSON in 2016, but a disappointing spring and a college commitment to the in-state ORGANIZATION left him undrafted. He performed steadily since moving into PERSON's rotation as a sophomore and allowed two earned runs or fewer in six of his eight Big Ten Conference starts this spring before helping lead PERSON to a runner-up finish in the ORGANIZATION World Series. When the ORGANIZATION took him ORGANIZATION. 77 overall and gave him full pick value to sign ($805,600), he joined teammate PERSON (ORGANIZATION. 74 overall to the D-backs) in giving the ORGANIZATION two pitchers taken in the top five rounds of the same Draft for the first time since 1994 (PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in the third round, PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in the fifth).PERSON owned one of the livelier fastballs in the college ranks, usually operating at 91-94 mph, topping out at 96 and holding his velocity deep into games. Its running and sinking action mirrors that of his solid changeup, which he sells well and has good separation from his heater. His slider ranges from 81-86 mph and can be an above-average pitch at times, though it lacks the consistency of his other two offerings.While PERSON has some effort in his delivery, he repeats it well and doesn't have any difficulty throwing strikes. He has a relatively high floor as a three-pitch starter with a track record of performance. His ability to generate ground balls will make him useful as a reliever if he can't cut it in a pro rotation.",-1

After the ORGANIZATION took four position players, three from the college ranks, with their first four picks in the top 3 rounds of the 2019 Draft, they nabbed PERSON in the fourth round and signed him for nearly $100,000 below pick value and he pitched his way to full-season ball during his pro debut.PERSON excels with a two-pitch power relief mix. While his fastball typically sits in the 92-95 mph range, he does touch 97-98 mph on occasion. He complements it with a hard slider, up to 88 mph, that has good cutter-like action. Both pitches play up because of excellent spin rates, allowing him to miss bats with both offerings and keeping hitters from squaring up the baseball consistently. He's also started to mix a curveball back into his mix. PERSON's control and command aren't pinpoint, but they don't have to be. Whether he can close at the big league level remains to be seen, but his ability to go right after hitters with his fastball-slider combination could allow him to move quickly through the ORGANIZATION system.",-1

While he still largely uses a contact-first approach, PERSON set career highs in extra-base hits and slugging percentage, and there's more over-the-fence power to come as he matures and continues to add strength. That might slow him down a touch, but he's still smart enough on the basepaths to steal bases. There might not be a better defensive third baseman in the Minors, with his agility, hands, arm and instincts all pointing to future ORGANIZATION awards.

He's an advanced high school hitter who doesn't try to do too much at the plate. He utilizes an effortless right-handed stroke and focuses on hitting line drives from gap to gap. He can turn on pitches when opponents challenge him inside and should develop average power. He lacks speed on the bases and first-step quickness, but PERSON has worked hard to get into better shape and improve as a defender. He has good instincts, soft hands and a strong arm that should allow him to remain at third base. PERSON had a 14-year big-league career. His son has the chance to be a better all-around player.",-1

They did it with PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, all early-round picks. So it was no surprise PERSON went straight to the LOCATION for his full-season debut. He held his own in the first half until what was thought to be a back injury forced him to miss most of the second half. It turned out to be a rib fracture, which is not expected to cause any long-term problems.The son of former big leaguer PERSON, Ke'Bryan has the chance to be an outstanding all-around third baseman at the big league level. He has a contact-first approach right now, content to use all fields and send line drives into the gaps. There were inconsistent glimpses of power and there should be more as he learns to turn on pitches more. A below-average runner, PERSON nonetheless has the footwork and range, not to mention excellent hands, instincts and a plus arm to be an above-average defender at the hot corner.PERSON missed some development time in 2016, logging 252 at-bats.

A move to the Class A Advanced PERSON in 2017 at age 20 didn't faze him at all.PERSON continues to refine his advanced approach as he moves up the ladder, gaining strength and adding speed as he goes. In 2017, his walk rate went up and his strikeout rate went down as his contact-oriented philosophy worked for him. He can drive the ball to all fields and while there wasn't much power in the pitching-friendly ORGANIZATION, scouts feel it will come as he continues to mature. As PERSON has gotten into better shape, he's become a much better baserunner, finishing among the league leaders in stolen bases in 2017. He's always been a gifted defender, but the added agility has led to more range and made him even stronger at the hot corner.The upper levels of the ORGANIZATION' system should provide a good challenge for PERSON, who will play all of 2018 at age 21.

He shared time at ORGANIZATION with PERSON, another prime catching prospect who's four years older but doesn't have as much offensive upside.A switch-hitter, PERSON has been much more effective from the left side of the plate and only one of his 23 homers in his first four pro seasons came from the right side. The toughest batter to strike out in the ORGANIZATION last season (12.6 plate appearances per whiff), he excels at making contact thanks to his advanced feel for the barrel and disciplined approach. He has solid raw power and could hit 15-20 homers on an annual basis once he hunts more pitches to drive and hits more balls in the air.PERSON is quicker than most catchers and moves well behind the plate. He has soft hands and frames the ball well, though he has occasional lapses of consistency with his receiving.

He's a switch-hitter with advanced feel to hit. He makes contact with ease and could grow into double-digit home run power once he matures physically.Strength gains also will help PERSON behind the plate.

He ranked third in hitting (.316) among PERSON catchers and earned another in-season promotion, moving to high Class A before he turned 19.A switch-hitter, PERSON has advanced feel for the barrel and a line-drive approach. He hits the ball with much more authority from the left side of the plate and slugged just .310 as a right-hander in 2017. Of his 11 homers in his first three pro seasons, six were in games in the final two months of last season, a sign that he's beginning to drive the ball more frequently and should develop at least double-digit home run power.PERSON runs better than most catchers and moves well behind the plate.

He has precocious feel to hit and makes consistent contact rather than trying to do too much. As he gets stronger, he could develop double-digit home run power.PERSON is even more advanced as a defender, displaying soft hands and impressive receiving ability for a teenager.

That it did, as PERSON shot up ORGANIZATION boards over the next couple of years en route to an above-slot bonus after the ORGANIZATION made the ORGANIZATION commit their second-round pick. At 6-foot-6, PERSON is the quintessential projectable high school right-hander. While he started the spring a bit slowly, in terms of his velocity, which was 87-91 mph, it's been ticking up, sitting 91-92 mph and regularly touching 94 mph, as it did during the shutout he threw at the ORGANIZATION in March. His fastball plays up because of its steep plane and angle, and there should be more consistent velocity to come as he matures. He throws both a slider and curve, with success, with some scouts thinking the curve will ultimately work better coming from his high three-quarter slot. He has some feel for a future average changeup, though he didn't throw it much in high school.Despite his size, PERSON tends to throw strikes and should have solid command and control, not to mention sharper stuff, once he figures out how to consistently repeat his delivery with his long levers.

The only question about his offensive profile is how consistently he'll hit to get to that power, as there is some swing and miss to his game. Beyond the bat, PERSON will show flashes of plus tools across the board. He's clocked sub-four-second times home to first out of the box and he was a plus defender at third, with very good hands, footwork, a plus arm and a willingness to stick his nose in the dirt. His profile took another leap forward when he started showing the ability to play shortstop and that's what the ORGANIZATION sent him out as during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION League.Because PERSON hadn't been invited to most of the summer showcase circuit events, there was a lack of track record on him against elite-level competition. That lack of challenge might make for a bumpier transition to pro ball, but there's confidence his tools will translate just fine eventually.",-1

A right-handed hitter with plenty of bat speed and projectable strength, he may put on the most impressive batting-practice shows in GPE's system. His 6-foot-5 frame gives him great leverage but also naturally adds length to his stroke but he has displayed the ability to make consistent contact as an amateur and early in his pro career.A long strider with plus speed, PERSON glides to balls in center field and projects as a quality defender there. If he slows down as he matures physically and has to move to a corner, he has enough arm for right field. He's years away from ORGANIZATION Stadium but has one of the highest ceilings in the organization.",-1
"Saving nearly $3 million by signing PERSON with the ORGANIZATION. 1 pick, the ORGANIZATION were able to spread their pool money around later in the GPE. Exhibit A of their efforts might be PERSON, the GPE high school right-hander who got $3.5 million at the start of the second round, nearly $2 million above pick value.PERSON provides an intriguing combination of projectability and pitchability. The ORGANIZATION native has the chance to have three at least above-average pitches in his arsenal. When he's firing on all cylinders, PERSON's fastball will sit in the 90-93 mph range, and with his frame, it's easy to dream about increased velocity. His breaking ball can be an out pitch with good bite, one that should develop into a true slider in time. PERSON has a better feel for a changeup than many high school pitchers, and he has shown advanced command for his age. He typically has a free and easy delivery that he repeats well.Some up-and-down performances last spring moved PERSON down some GPE boards. The ORGANIZATION feel that worked to their advantage, allowing them to get a first-round talent in the second round.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION made a considerable investment to sign PERSON, taking him in the second round of the 2016 Draft, but going way above pick value with a $3.5 million bonus to keep him from heading to ORGANIZATION. They've barely been able to get any return on the investment as he made four brief PERSON outings after being drafted, then needed PERSON surgery in the summer of '17, knocking him out for all of the '18 season.The good news is PERSON did get on the mound and threw in the very last instructional league game last fall, heading into the offseason healthy and in good spirits. The ORGANIZATION are optimistic they can get the PERSON they drafted back, or perhaps an even better version as he has added strength during the rehab process. Before the injury, the right-hander stood out for his advanced feel for pitching, especially given his age, showing the ability to throw three pitches for strikes consistently. His fastball was in the low 90s, with the chance to add velocity as he filled out his 6-foot-4 frame. His breaking ball was a bit of a hybrid slider that flashed above-average, and he showed good feel for a changeup.The most important thing now is for PERSON to get a full, healthy year of innings in so he can put his surgery firmly in the rear view mirror. There's still plenty of time for him to reach his big league starter potential.",-1
"GPE was a potential first-round pick as a projectable high school right-hander from PERSON as the 2016 PERSON approached. A bit of an uneven senior year, along with some signability concerns because of a commitment to ORGANIZATION, drove him down to the second round. Because the ORGANIZATION saved money on signing PERSON, they were able to give GPE $3.5 million to sign.GPE didn't throw much during his pro debut last summer and was initially set back by biceps tendinitis before PERSON surgery ended his 2017 season in mid-August. But the ORGANIZATION realized they didn't have to do much with his sound and clean delivery. He uses those polished mechanics to offer up a solid three-pitch mix, with some upside to come. He throws his fastball in the 90-93 mph range consistently, and with his 6-foot-4 frame looking like it could take on more strength, there could be extra velocity in the future. GPE calls his breaking ball a curve, but it's more of a hybrid, and some within the organization feel it will eventually develop into an above-average slider. GPE has good feel for his changeup, giving him at least a third Major League average offering. He can throw strikes with all three.The ORGANIZATION know patience will be important in terms of GPE's physical maturity, but they are excited by how little they had to tinker mechanically with how he does it on the mound.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION were very excited to land PERSON in the second round of the 2016 Draft. He was a potential first-rounder, and the organization gave him a bonus to sign him away from ORGANIZATION as if he were one. PERSON saved to sign No. 1 overall pick PERSON was used to give the right-hander $3.5 million, but the ORGANIZATION will have to wait for the return on that investment as he had PERSON surgery last August and will miss the 2018 season.Before the injury, PERSON ironically stood out for his clean delivery to go along with a very good feel for pitching. His fastball was in the 90-93 mph range with the kind of projectable frame that pointed to added velocity. He complemented the heater with a bit of a hybrid breaking ball that looked headed toward being an above-average slider in time and he has a very good feel for a changeup. He showed acumen for throwing all three for strikes. Seeing him with three above-average to plus pitches with solid command in the future isn't an unreasonable projection.The goal is to get PERSON on the mound at instructs in the fall. His previous feel for pitching, combined with the overall success rate of pitchers coming back from this surgery still has theorganization quite bullish on PERSON's future.",-1
"As the ORGANIZATION. 1 international prospect according to ORGANIZATION at the start of the 2016-17 prospect, one signed by the ORGANIZATION for $4.25 million that July and immediately compared to the likes of PERSON and PERSON, PERSON came with huge expectations. There was more of a spotlight on him in ORGANIZATIONvember 2017 when he was declared a free agent as part of the penalty levied against the ORGANIZATION for violating international signing rules. The GPE swooped in and gave PERSON $2.2 million to join the organization and sent him out as an 18-year-old in the ORGANIZATION League.While the overall numbers look pedestrian, the GPE were pleased with how PERSON competed against largely older players, notching 22 extra-base hits and a solid hard-hit percentage. They believe the power is for real and have seen the teenager continue to improve his athleticism and strength training. He also improved defensively, seeing time at both shortstop and third. While his lack of speed has most believing he has no shot at playing shortstop at higher levels, he'll continue to get reps and multiple positions so he can see the ball from different spots and angles on the infield.PERSON hasn't lit the world on fire like some top international prospects have in recent years. But he's also just 19 years old and ready to attack full-season baseball, with the GPE eager to see how he handles the challenge of aggressive assignments.",-1
"Ranked No. 1 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 international prospects list entering the 2016 July 2 signing period, GPE signed with the ORGANIZATION for a reported $4.25 million as the ORGANIZATION were extremely active in the international market, signing five players from that Top 30 list.GPE sits at the top of that group, lauded as the best international prospect since PERSON and his talents have been compared to a young PERSON and PERSON. The ORGANIZATION teenager is a switch-hitter who has shown power from both sides of the plate. He has also displayed hitting mechanics and an approach at the plate that are beyond his years. PERSON and agile, GPE is a sound defensive player and has displayed good range in both directions. He has one of the best arms in the class and a high baseball IQ. PERSON also like his frame. Currently a shortstop, he profiles best as a third baseman in the future. Scouted since he was 14, GPE tends to make the game look easy. Some see him as a once-in-a-generation type talent and no one would be surprised to see him jump up prospect lists once he gets his pro career going.",-1
"Switch-hitters who have the chance to hit for power and average from both sides while potentially staying up the middle defensively aren't exactly easy to find. That's a big reason why GPE was ranked No. 1 on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 international prospects list entering the 2016 July 2 signing period and why the ORGANIZATION shelled out $4.25 million to sign him. GPE was declared a free agent last November, however, as part of the penalty levied against the ORGANIZATION for violation of baseball's rules on signing international amateur free agents. The ORGANIZATION swooped in and signed GPE for $2.2 million in December once he was eligible to join another organization.The PERSON teenager had been compared to PERSON and his ceiling has been put side-by-side with the likes of PERSON and PERSON, though a pedestrian pro debut in 2017 had cooled some evaluators' opinions of him. He has pop from both sides, with perhaps a touch more from the right side. While he's not a runner, he is agile and athletic in the field. He has a very strong arm and good instincts, and while most foresee a move to third in the future, he will continue to play shortstop for the ORGANIZATION. There are some concerns regarding his conditioning, something he'll need to watch if he doesn't want to become a first base-only type, though he had shed some weight at instructs with the ORGANIZATION last fall.Wherever he plays defensively, GPE has the combination of hitting tools and feel for the game to potentially develop into a future superstar in the middle of a lineup. He'll be just 18 for all of the 2018 season, so patience will be key.",-1

"PERSON bounced between the starting rotation and bullpen during his three years at ORGANIZATION and spent most of his junior year pitching in relief. Seeing untapped potential in the 6-foot-5 left-hander as starter, the ORGANIZATION made PERSON their seventh-round pick in the 2018 Draft and signed him for $222,300. He immediately rewarded the organization with an outstanding pro debut in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League, working in both roles, before assuming a full-time starter in his first full season. PERSON has rapidly blossomed in the role, pitching well in the Class A Advanced PERSON to begin his first full season before moving up to Double-A in mid-July.PERSON doesn't have the type of power stuff that his 6-foot-5 frame might suggest, but he knows how to be effective with his three-pitch mix and masks everything he throws with natural deception. He pitches with average velocity, typically sitting in the low 90s, but his heater plays at a higher effective velocity because he gets good extension to the plate and throws it with a high spin rate that nets him whiffs inside the zone. His late-biting slider gives him a second swing-and-miss offering, and he's made strides in developing a quality changeup since entering the pro ranks. PERSON's extension along with his long arm action on the backside makes him difficult to time, let alone square up, and he's had no problems carving up hitters on both sides of the plate early in his career. With more development, he could carve out a role as a No. 4 starter in the big leagues, while his size, angle and stuff give him a solid floor as a bullpen asset.",-1
"A talented two-way player as a high schooler in GPE -- one many teams preferred as a left-handed pitcher -- PERSON's athleticism and offensive upside appealed to the ORGANIZATION, who drafted him in the third round of the 2016 Draft and went over pick value to sign him. He's moved rapidly thus far, making his Double-A debut right after he turned 20 in 2018.PERSON has the tools to be an impact player on both sides of the ball and with some adjustments to his offensive approach, he could be a better than average hitter with outstanding power. While he cut down his strikeout rate considerably in 2018 and has excellent plate discipline, PERSON's willingness to see pitches can work against him. He'll often take too many hittable pitches early in counts and then hasn't altered his two-strike approach at all. If he can learn to be a bit more aggressive early in counts, then pitchers will start trying to expand the zone early, where his advanced eye will come in handy. All of that should put him in better counts to use his bat speed and loft to get to his power more frequently without his K rate skyrocketing. Defensively, PERSON can handle playing center field and will continue to get plenty of time there in the ORGANIZATION. But he likely profiles better as a right fielder, where his cannon for an arm plays well and he has the chance to be a plus defender overall. The ORGANIZATION are hoping his time in Double-A and in the ORGANIZATION will help him continue up the ladder quickly after he lost time due to a back injury.",-1
"One of the best two-way prospects in the 2016 Draft, PERSON intrigued several clubs as a left-handed pitcher with a fastball that tops out at 94 mph and a solid slider. PERSON preferred PERSON's GPE player of the year as an outfielder and made him a full-time position player after signing him for $750,000 as a third-round pick.The PERSON believed PERSON was the best athlete available when they drafted him with the 103rd overall choice, and he has the potential for average or better tools across the board. He has surprising pop for someone 5-foot-10 and 170 pounds, the product of quality bat speed from the left side of the plate. He has a line-drive stroke and a patient approach that should help him hit for average.PERSON is an average runner out of the batter's box and a little quicker on the bases. He played primarily center field while also manning both corners in his pro debut, and he figures to end up in right field. He could be a solid defender there and definitely has the arm strength required for the position.",-1
"Though he had a low-90s fastball and a promising slider, intriguing several clubs as a left-handed pitching prospect, the ORGANIZATION liked his multitool ability more. They made him a full-time outfielder after signing him for an over-slot $750,000 as a third-rounder in 2016, and they have no reason to regret that decision. He led the Rookie-level PERSON in runs (43), triples (six) and total bases (88) during his pro debut, then ranked second in homers (17) and third in walks (65) in the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION at age 19 last year.If he can make some adjustments at the plate, PERSON could have solid or better tools across the board. Though he's not physically imposing at 5-foot-10, the bat speed and loft in his left-handed swing give him surprising raw power. He has some feel to hit and a willingness to work counts, though he needs to tone down his aggressiveness after fanning a SAL-high 171 times last year.With his solid speed, PERSON could be a 20-20 player if he refines his basestealing technique after getting caught in 18 of his 38 attempts in 2017. He split last season between center and right field, showing the range to stick at the former position and ORGANIZATION upside at the latter. His strong arm allowed him to register 14 assists in 119 games.",-1
"PERSON drew interest from clubs as both an outfielder and a left-handed pitcher in the 2016 Draft. Though he had a low-90s fastball and a promising slider, the ORGANIZATION liked his bat and made him a full-time position player after signing him for an above-slot $750,000 as a third-round pick. PERSON's 2016 GPE high school player of the year, he topped the Rookie-level PERSON in runs (43), triples (six) and total bases (88) while ranking second in on-base percentage (.396) and fifth in slugging (.484).Kansas ORGANIZATION considered PERSON the best athlete available with the 103rd overall choice, and he has average or better tools across the board. Though he's not physically imposing, he has some juice in his quick left-handed stroke. He has good feel to hit and a mature approach, plus he already has shown the ability to make adjustments at the plate.An average runner out of the batter's box, PERSON shows more speed once he gets going. He played all three outfield spots in his pro debut, getting most of his time in center field, though he may be better suited for a corner in the long run. His obvious arm strength would play well in right field.",-1
" PERSON, whose uncle Cole played in the big leagues and father PERSON was drafted by the ORGANIZATION, had missed most of his junior season with a broken hand and was then rusty on the summer showcase circuit. He was able to shake that off during a strong senior season, putting him more firmly on the prospect map. The ORGANIZATION nabbed him in the fourth round of the 2018 Draft and gave him a well above pick value bonus of $900,000 to sign him away from his ORGANIZATION of GPE commitment. GPE and lanky, PERSON has some serious raw tools to grow into. He will need to add strength to his frame to help his bat come along, which will be a bit of a project. Some amateur scouts didn't love his spread-out setup, though that's a mechanical fix that can be addressed in pro ball. There is bat speed and raw power to tap into and his 6-foot-2 frame should be able to handle good weight. His plus speed helps him on both sides of the ball. He's even better once underway, which allows him to cover a ton of ground in the outfield. He has a strong arm to boot, one which would work from a corner, but he has the tools to stick in center field.Patience will be the key for the ORGANIZATION' player development staff as it will take time for PERSON's raw tools to turn into consistent production. The end result could be a pretty dynamic up-the-middle player, so the wait could be worth it.",-1
"GPE went homerless as a freshman in 2017 and went deep just five times as a Draft-eligible sophomore, then exploded for 23 long balls (fourth in ORGANIZATION Division I) and powered his way into the first round in 2019. He tied a ORGANIZATION record with three homers in the fifth game of his junior season and won ORGANIZATION player of the year honors after setting league records for homers, total bases (183), slugging percentage (.779) and runs (72). A year after the ORGANIZATION took him in the 35th round, the ORGANIZATION selected him 25th overall and signed him for $2,740,300.ORGANIZATION's best offensive prospect since 2003 Indians first-rounder PERSON, GPE possesses plenty of natural power. He had demonstrated a good right-handed swing and the ability to use the leverage in his 6-foot-4 frame in the past, and he began to capitalize on his power potential once he got stronger. He drives the ball from gap to gap while maintaining a disciplined approach that led to more walks than strikeouts in his final college season.GPE moves well for his size, albeit with below-average speed. He has the solid arm strength required at third base and enough range to stay at the position. With his power, he still could profile as a regular if he moved across the diamond to first base.",-1
"The nephew of former All-Star Ryan Franklin, PERSON ranked as GPE's top high school prospect in 2018 but missed most of his senior season with a broken right foot. The ORGANIZATION still took him in the sixth round that June and signed him for $540,000, the equivalent of late third-round money. Fully healthy this year, he has established himself as one of the best young pitching prospects in the system.Franklin's fastball velocity has climbed as he has grown into his 6-foot-4 frame, rising from 86-89 mph in 2017 to 89-93 last year to 91-96 this summer. He has shown more feel for fading a changeup which shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch than for spinning the ball. He currently uses a curveball but may be better off switching to a slider.Franklin still has projection remaining in his 6-foot-4 frame, so he could continue to add more power to his stuff. His size and high-three-quarters delivery create steep downhill plane that makes it difficult to drive his pitches. He's a good athlete who repeats his mechanics well and throws strikes.",-1
"PERSON committed early to ORGANIZATION, but the ORGANIZATION pulled their scholarship offer after he didn't perform well during his junior season or the subsequent summer. That spurred him to get stronger and improve his mental approach, which helped him lead LOCATION (Winter Garden, Fla.) to its first-ever PERSON Class 9A semifinal appearance in 2016. It also got him selected in the third round by the ORGANIZATION, earning him an over-slot $675,000 bonus.PERSON has some interesting offensive potential. He's a switch-hitter who makes contact from both sides of the plate, and he could have average or better power once he fills out his 6-foot-1 frame. He has average speed and moves well on the bases, though he won't be much of a threat to steal.Texas is intrigued by PERSON's defensive versatility. He broke into pro ball playing primarily third base and some shortstop, and the hot corner may be where he profiles best. He's also capable of playing second base and the outfield corners, giving him utility value if he can't make it as a regular.",-1
" PERSON made PERSON's weekend rotation as a freshman, became its No. 1 starter as a sophomore and bolstered his reputation with strong summers in the ORGANIZATION and with PERSON. His velocity and PERSON stock dipped a bit in 2018, though he still helped the ORGANIZATION reach the ORGANIZATION World Series and won his lone start in GPE. One of the youngest college players in the 2018 PERSON, he was three months shy of his 21st birthday when the FACILITY made him a third-round pick in June. Signed for $650,000, PERSON has the makings of three potential solid or better offerings. He worked mostly at 88-91 mph and topped out at 93 this spring, but he has reached 96 in the past and still succeeds at lower velocities because his size and high three-quarters arm slot create steep downhill plane. He has good feel for his advanced change and also uses a slider that can get slurvy at times.Though his delivery got offline to the plate during his junior season, PERSON threw more strikes than he had in the past. He has a strong frame that's built to eat innings and has a high floor as at least a back-of-the-rotation starter. If he finds his missing velocity, he could become more than that.",-1
"After cracking PERSON's rotation as a freshman, becoming its No. 1 starter as a sophomore and starring in the ORGANIZATION and with the GPE national team, PERSON positioned himself as a likely first-round pick entering 2018. Though he helped the ORGANIZATION make the ORGANIZATION World Series and won his lone start there, his stuff regressed and he lasted until the third round. Signed for a below-slot $650,000, he didn't see his stuff bounce back immediately in his brief pro debut.PERSON showed the ability to sit in the low 90s and reach 96 mph with his fastball in the past, but he spent most of 2018 ranging from 87-93 mph, both in college and in pro ball. His heater still remained effective because his 6-foot-3 frame and high-three-quarters arm slot provide steep downhill plane. He has advanced feel for a fading changeup, his best offering, but less consistency with a slurvy curveball and a newly added slider.The ORGANIZATION would like to see PERSON add life to his fastball, which gets hit when it flattens out, and take a more direct path to the plate so he can stay on top his curve. He throws strikes but needs better command because he can't make many mistakes with his less-than-overpowering stuff. He has a floor of a durable back-of-the-rotation option and a ceiling of a No. 3 starter if he can regain his previous velocity.",-1
"PERSON batted just .243/.332/.392 as a part-timer in his first two years at GPE, then made a surprising leap into the first round of the 2019 Draft. He hit .337/.416/.619 as a junior while batting behind ORGANIZATION. 3 overall pick PERSON and wound up going 32nd overall to the ORGANIZATION himself. Viewed as more of a third-round talent by most clubs, he signed for a below-slot $1.75 million.Houston locked in on PERSON's well above-average raw power and arm strength and didn't care how other teams rated him. His strength and bat speed allow him to drive the ball out of the park to all fields, and the ORGANIZATION believe he may develop more pop if he simplifies his right-handed swing. He displayed the ability to make contact and manage the strike zone even when he wasn't posting big numbers in college.After bouncing between catcher, both infield corners and DH as a sophomore, PERSON became a full-time backstop last spring. He moves well enough behind the plate and has improved his receiving, showing the potential to become an average defender once he gains more experience. He definitely has the arm to combat the running game, and he threw out 40 percent of basestealers in his final college season.",-1
"ORGANIZATION was an offensive force during his two years at ORGANIZATION CC (PERSON, GPE), batting .398/.471/.569 with 50 extra-base hits, 150 runs and 83 steals over 113 games while leading the ORGANIZATION to their first ORGANIZATION appearance in nearly 20 years in 2018. The ORGANIZATION took ORGANIZATION in the 12th round that June and signed him for $210,000 -- nearly half of which counted against their bonus pool -- and he rewarded the organization with a strong pro debut in the ORGANIZATION before advancing to full-season ball in 2019. ORGANIZATION's carrying tool is his speed, which earns plus-plus grades from evaluators and enables him to impact the game on both sides of the ball. His pure hitting ability is fringy and he'll never offer much in the way of power, but he handles the bat well enough to let his speed play. He earns praise for his baserunning and aggression on the basepaths, but is still learning how to read pitchers and pick his spots in order to be an effective basestealer. After spending most of his pro debut at shortstop while also working at second and third base, ORGANIZATION has played the outfield exclusively in his first full season, with the bulk of his reps coming as a center fielder. His speed is an asset there and gives him plenty of range, though his jumps and routes remain a work in progress. A return to the infield for ORGANIZATION hasn't been ruled out, and he's continued to take ground balls at both middle-infield positions during practice as the ORGANIZATION groom him for a potential super-utility role.",-1
"If there was a college pitcher available when the ORGANIZATION were picking in the early stages of the 2018 Draft, it was safe to assume the organization was going to take a long look at him. PERSON took five college arms with its first five picks in the top two rounds. After nabbing GPE right-handers PERSON and PERSON, then GPE lefty PERSON with their first three picks, the ORGANIZATION went out west and got another lefty in PERSON, PERSON's Saturday starter, with pick No. 40 overall, sending him to the Rookie-level PERSON for his pro debut last summer.PERSON has relied heavily on his fastball and changeup combination with good results. There isn't a ton of velocity differential between the two pitches -- his fastball will sit 91-93 mph and he'll be up to 84-85 mph with his changeup at times -- but his deceptive arm speed and fading action on it makes it an out pitch. PERSON's funky delivery makes it tough for any hitter to pick up either pitch. His curveball isn't as consistent, but there's some projection there, as he used to shelve the pitch if he didn't have the feel for it, something that won't work at the next level. When his delivery is in sync, it can be an above-average pitch; when his timing is off, it can come in soft and up in the zone.Even with the unorthodox delivery, PERSON has always been a strike-thrower and looks like a future No. 4 type starter. He might be a half-step behind the other college arms taken in front of him, but he could easily catch up as he starts his pro career in earnest.",-1
"PERSON emerged as PERSON's best starter as a sophomore in 2017, then boosted his stock further by leading the ORGANIZATION in strikeouts and winning its pitcher of the year award that summer. He continued to perform while displaying improved stuff this spring, leading the GPE to take him 40th overall in the supplemental first round. The fourth of five college arms PERSON popped at the top of the GPE, he signed for $1,597,500. Like GPE first-rounder PERSON, PERSON had one of the best changeups in the 2018 GPE, a consistent plus pitch that he's not afraid to use several times in a row. He has added some fastball velocity this year, working more consistently in the low 90s and topping out at 95 mph with sink when he keeps it down in the strike zone. His curveball has shown signs of becoming an average third offering as he has used it more often.PERSON has the arsenal and control to make it as a starter, though some evaluators wonder about his mechanics because he has a long arm action in the back of his delivery and a pause at the top. That doesn't prevent him from throwing strikes and gives him some added deception. A good bet to become a No. 4 starter, he stands out more with his floor than his ceiling.",-1
" The ORGANIZATION has jumped on the baseball map a bit more in recent years, with the ORGANIZATION inking PERSON for $6 million in 2015. The D-backs have scouted heavily there, signing PERSON for $200,000 that same summer. They went back this July and inked the toolsy PERSON, who is related to GPE Olympic legend PERSON, for close to $2.55 million. No. 15 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list, PERSON is a physical specimen with tools and upside. A terrific athlete, PERSON has plus speed and has shown an ability to get good reads and take good routes on defense. His arm is currently playable in center, with some feeling he might eventually fit the profile of an athletic right fielder. That will certainly be true if he can tap into his raw power consistently as he develops. He needs to work on recognizing breaking and offspeed stuff in order to get there. PERSON love his makeup, giving him a good chance to be a breakout star from this international class.",-1
"Most people think of the ORGANIZATION as a vacation destination. The scouting industry, more and more of late, is seeing it as a place to mine for baseball talent. The D-backs have been particularly busy, signing PERSON for $200,000 in 2015 and going all in on PERSON's tools for more than $2.5 million.PERSON was No. 15 on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list heading into the July signing period in 2017 because of his raw tools, athleticism and tremendous ceiling. The D-backs love his physicality and potential to tap into his considerable raw power. He showed a pretty good understanding of the strike zone with some plate discipline already, especially given his age and lack of experience, and the D-backs know there will be a learning curve in terms of recognizing breaking and offspeed stuff. PERSON has enough speed to stay in center, but there's the chance he'll outgrow the spot, in which case he'll fit nicely in a corner.The D-backs are preaching patience and caution when talking about PERSON, noting that coming from the ORGANIZATION isn't the same as coming from a place like the ORGANIZATION in terms of experience. They see PERSON shortstop PERSON as a potential model, one who played in the ORGANIZATION for his first summer of pro ball, while PERSON was able to make his debut in the GPE, playing in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION in 2018.",-1
"Two years removed from their signing of shortstop PERSON for $200,000, the D-backs tapped into the GPE baseball pipeline again in 2017. This time, however, they shelled out big money to land PERSON, signing ORGANIZATION's No. 15 international prospect for more than $2.5 million. He already looks to be a worthy investment for the club after an impressive pro debut at age 17 that he followed with a red-hot start in the Class A Short PERSON in 2019.PERSON is a physical specimen who generates massive raw power to all fields and already has shown that he can apply it during games. His understanding of the strike zone and plate discipline stands out given his age and lack of experience. Those qualities, along with his explosive swing, give PERSON a chance to be at least an average hitter. He has the speed, range and instincts for center field, though, with so much physical projection remaining, there is a chance he'll outgrow the spot, in which he'll fit nicely at either outfield corner.PERSON has the highest ceiling of any player in GPE's system as a slugger who also has feel to hit and the potential to stick in center field. While the early returns have been impressive, the D-backs continue to preach patience with regards to PERSON's development, as they note that coming from the ORGANIZATION isn't the same as coming from a place like the ORGANIZATION in terms of experience. At the same time, it's hard not to get excited about a player that oozes as much potential as PERSON.",-1
"A three-year starter at ORGANIZATION, PERSON was decent as a freshman and sophomore before taking a step forward and earning PERSON All-Star honors in the summer of 2017. He built on that momentum and hit the ball with more authority this spring, propelling him into the third round. The highest Rebels hitter selected since PERSON was an Athletics second-rounder in 1999, he signed for $592,300.PERSON has a compact left-handed swing and a patient approach that produces line drives to all fields. He can catch up to quality fastballs and translated his deceptive strength into more power as a junior, hitting 14 homers to double his total from his first two seasons. He also has plus speed and good instincts on the bases, completing a package that could fit atop a lineup.PERSON's quickness and savvy allow him to cover ground in center field, where he displays average arm strength. He played second base as a ORGANIZATION freshman and would have even more value if he could play there, though the Royals have no immediate plans to use him in the infield. He has drawn comparisons to PERSON and PERSON that would hold more true if he moved to second.",-1
"GPE scouts will readily admit that a strong performance by a college player in the ORGANIZATION League can go a long way. When a player like PERSON, who jumped on the map with an All-Star performance on the GPE, carries it over to a big junior season, that's even better. That's exactly what the three-year ORGANIZATION starter did, catapulting himself into the third round then going out and having a big pro debut.PERSON has a good feel for the strike zone to go along with deceptive strength to make him a very intriguing hitting prospect. He started tapping into his power as a junior with a more leveraged swing. With that has come more length, and it will be interesting to see how he reacts to fastballs up in the zone as he progresses. He isn't big, but there is power there, and his swing reminds some of PERSON's. While he's not a top-of-the-scale speedster, he's an excellent baserunner who can steal a base, one who will continue to hit leadoff in the Minors, even if he doesn't settle in there once he reaches the big leagues. Similarly, he can handle center field, but could easily end up sliding to left in deference to a faster teammate in center. He's worked a little at second base, a position he played as a freshman at ORGANIZATION, but he's unlikely to see any game action for now. It gives him the possibility for flexibility should his advanced bat be ready to find a place in the lineup, in a ORGANIZATION kind of situation.",-1
"ORGANIZATION committed to PERSON as a high school junior even though the ORGANIZATION had two premium catching prospects, PERSON and PERSON, in the recruiting class ahead of him. PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION as a first-round pick but PERSON made it to campus, which meant ORGANIZATION spent his first two college seasons playing first base while PERSON blossomed into the ORGANIZATION. 2 overall pick in the 2018 Draft. ORGANIZATION returned behind the plate as a junior and finished among ORGANIZATION Division I leaders with 23 home runs, landing him in the fourth round of the 2019 Draft and earning him a just above pick value $500,000 bonus.ORGANIZATION's best tool is his plus raw left-handed power, and he uses the strength and leverage in his 6-foot-2 frame to drive the ball to all fields. There's some swing and miss in his game and he has yet to have much success with wood bats, so he probably won't hit for a high average. But he compensates by working deep counts and drawing plenty of walks to fuel healthy on-base percentages.There were mixed reviews of ORGANIZATION's defensive prowess. While he's improving as he gets more time behind the plate, he may never be more than a fringy receiver. He has solid to plus arm strength, though his long arm stroke means it plays closer to average. He did see some time at first base, while also catching, during his pro debut this summer.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION love to go aggressively after high school pitching and they did that with PERSON in 2016, taking him in the second round of that June's PERSON and then going over slot to sign him for $2.5 million. Unlike most of their high school draftees, PERSON wasn't ready for full-season ball right after his PERSON year, instead spending the summer in the Rookie-level GPE. Propelled by strong offseason workouts, he hit the ground running in 2018, pitching across three levels and finishing with a stint in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON was able to start moving more quickly because his velocity bounced back to closer to what scouts saw in his high school days. Some of that was because of GPE workouts this offseason and some of it occurred as PERSON consistently found his arm slot and utilized a much more athletic delivery. More free and easy, the left-hander hit 94-95 mph with his fastball consistently, though he would lose command at times when he cranked it up. He could get fastball-heavy at times, trying to blow the ball past hitters, and he needs to learn to more effectively mix in his secondary stuff.More than anything, PERSON needs to find a level of consistency. If he can learn to pitch with his rediscovered plus fastball and sharpen his breaking ball and changeup more effectively, he could give the ORGANIZATION another No. 3- or 4-type starter.",-1
"A talented two-way player in high school who contended for the national high school lead in home runs this past spring, PERSON was even more impressive as a pitcher, putting him into first-round consideration in the 2016 Draft. PERSON. 44 overall, the ORGANIZATION gave PERSON an above pick-value $2.5 million bonus to sign him away from his GPE commitment.PERSON's velocity took a jump forward this past spring, from the 86-87 mph he showed on the showcase circuit up to the low 90s consistently, even touching 95 mph on occasion. He throws it with sink and tail and he uses his 6-foot-6 frame to create angle and plane that are difficult for hitters to handle. PERSON's curve is inconsistent, but when his mechanics are right, it can be an at-least average offering. He shows some feel for a changeup with fade and tumble, though he didn't use it much in high school. A very good athlete with a tremendous build, PERSON tends to repeat his delivery well, allowing him to throw strikes. He and his 2016 Draft cohorts, PERSON and PERSON, could give the ORGANIZATION a tremendous 1-2-3 in a big league rotation in the future.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION like pushing their young high school arms to full-season ball the season after they are drafted, and they've done so with positive results of late. The hope was that PERSON, to whom they gave an above-pick value bonus of $2.5 million in the second round of the 2016 Draft, would follow that model, but he wasn't ready to make the jump, instead spending his second summer of pro ball in the Rookie-level Appalachian League.Since PERSON became a pro, his stuff had been down, with a dip in velocity. Much of that, the ORGANIZATION believe, was due to a mechanical breakdown in his delivery: His arm had gotten too straight overhand, instead of a more comfortable three-quarters slot. He started showing a little more life to his fastball, closer to what he showed pre-Draft, near the end of his season with PERSON, with the hope he's on his way back to sitting at 92-93 mph, in the same ballpark as fellow lefty PERSON. His breaking ball regained some of its shape, showing some good downer action with tight spin, and his changeup showed glimpses of depth. When he's right, he uses his 6-foot-6 frame very well on the mound.Not every pitcher can follow the same exact development path, and PERSON may greatly benefit from not being pushed too aggressively. His move to full-season ball will be a good test to see how far he's come.",-1
"A tremendous athlete and two-way player during his high school career in GPE, PERSON was the ORGANIZATION of the Year in 2016. He parlayed his strong senior season into being the 44th overall pick of the ORGANIZATION, in the second round, and received an above pick-value bonus of $2.5 million to sign rather than head to the ORGANIZATION of GPE to both pitch and hit.As a pro, PERSON's future is undoubtedly on the mound, though he's already shown an eagerness to swing the bat whenever he's given the chance. PERSON pitched sparingly during his debut, but he was effective even though his velocity was down a bit from the low-90s-to-95 mph spike he showed in high school. PERSON uses his 6-foot-6 frame extremely well, throwing downhill and with sink. He also has good deception in his very repeatable delivery, so hitters do not square him up very often. His secondary stuff is inconsistent right now, but he does flash a plus breaking ball at times and has a good feel for a changeup with fade and tumble. Given his size, stuff, feel for pitching and athleticism, not to mention that he's focusing on pitching for the first time, PERSON brings a lot of upside to the table. Watching him, PERSON and PERSON develop together could be a whole lot of fun.",-1
"PERSON put himself on the map for 2019 as a Stanford sophomore the previous year by finishing second on the team in homers, slugging percentage and ORGANIZATION. He raised his profile even more by showing he could put up similar numbers with wood bats, finishing fifth in the ORGANIZATION in batting average and tied for fourth in home runs. He didn't quite replicate that success during his junior season, but was coming on a bit stronger to climb out of his early-season funk before the ORGANIZATION took him with the ORGANIZATION. 71 overall pick in the June Draft. PERSON' power is legitimate, with the ability to drive the ball to all fields with good bat speed, and he showed enough ability to make contact to hit .326 in the Cape over the summer. There is length in his left-handed swing, however, leading to some swing and miss issues at times, including 34 strikeouts in 34 Cape League games. A solid athlete who runs well enough, PERSON has largely stuck to the outfield corners in college, though he did some time in center field as a junior. He may continue to receive reps up the middle in pro ball, though most see left field as his likely long-term home.Power is always a hot commodity, especially from a college left-handed hitter, and the ORGANIZATION are hopeful that PERSON' will translate in the professional ranks. He has the raw offensive tools, including plus bat speed and leveraged swing, needed to profile at an outfield corner at the highest level.",-1
"There's an assumption that a pitcher who stands nearly seven feet tall is going to be a flame-thrower, a la PERSON. PERSON, who got an over-slot bonus of $225,000 to sign out of the ORGANIZATION, GPE, high school ranks as a 22nd-rounder in 2016, bucks conventional wisdom by thriving thanks to his feel for pitching, not his pure stuff. PERSON inflammation limited him to just under 60 total innings in what was supposed to be his full-season debut in 2018, and he made just four outings in 2019 before needing PERSON surgery.PERSON uses his long levers and his outstanding command to allow him to succeed despite not having eye-popping stuff. Velocity-wise, his fastball is below-average, thrown in the 86-91 mph range, but it's on the plate when he releases it, he throws it with excellent life to elicit ground-ball outs and commands it well, all of which makes it play up. He mixes in an average breaking ball and changeup as well, though he needs to continue to work on the consistency of his secondary stuff.As PERSON continues to add strength to his enormous frame, there is the chance he could add a few ticks to his fastball. But it's really going to be his height, life, deception, command and feel to pitch that will carry him up the organizational ladder.",-1
"From a town known as PERSON, GPE, rode a pitcher with potential for a three-pitch mix. His age, and his size, made the PERSON roll the dice, taking PERSON in the 22nd round of the 2016 Draft and go over pick value to sign him away from attending PERSON. He pitched well in his brief summer debut and then pitched exceptionally well in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in 2017. He was having similar success with the move to full-season ball in 2018, though he was shelved with elbow inflammation.PERSON is a 6-foot-10 southpaw, but unlike with many pitchers that big, and that young, he has tremendous control of his body. That allows him to repeat a good, solid delivery and fill the strike zone with all three of his pitches. His fastball sits average velocity-wise right now, but it plays up because of his extension and his ability to command it, and it's easy to see more in the tank. He throws what will be at least an average slider and he shows some feel for a changeup, though that's behind his other two offerings. It's been a small sample size so far, but in his first 92 professional innings, PERSON has walked just 1.7 per nine.The PERSON knew it would be a longer process of getting the tall, lanky high schooler up to speed, and to his credit, PERSON has been very committed to the program, spending extra time in Clearwater working on gaining strength and his pitching craft. He could take a nice step forward in 2018.",-1
"The best athlete in the 2015 Draft, PERSON drew first-round interest from several clubs but opted out of the process because he was also the nation's top-rated dual threat quarterback prospect and wanted to play football and baseball at PERSON A&M. Despite playing regularly as a freshman for the ORGANIZATION, he opted to transfer to GPE, where he had to sit out 2016 before backing up PERSON winner PERSON last fall. After looking overmatched at the plate in his return to baseball with the ORGANIZATION and in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON made drastic improvements as a redshirt sophomore, posting an .954 OPS with 10 homers and 10 steals. Targeting PERSON's tremendous upside, the A's selected him with the ORGANIZATION. 9 pick in June and then signed him for $4,660,000, under the condition that he'd be allowed to play football in the fall of 2018 before transitioning to baseball full time.PERSON's gains were obvious during his breakout spring as he made better contact, showed better aptitude for recognizing spin and did a better job of controlling the strike zone. He has the plus-plus speed to create havoc on the bases and the bat speed and strength to produce average power. The son of former PERSON A&M quarterback and ORGANIZATION farmhand PERSON and the nephew of two-time first-rounder and five-year big leaguer PERSON, PERSON still needs to reduce his strikeouts further and is a work in progress defensively. He's still learning reads and routes but has the quickness to outrun his mistakes and eventually could become at least a solid center fielder. His arm has regressed on the diamond and currently plays below average.Oakland's decision to allow PERSON to play football in the fall comes with obvious risk, as any injury suffered on the gridiron likely would further delay the start of PERSON's baseball career. If he can stay healthy, PERSON, with his tools and the surprising progress he has made on the diamond, could one day provide the A's with a huge return on their investment.",-1
"GPE was one of the youngest players in the 2019 ORGANIZATION class, one who doesn't turn 18 until November. Combine that with an all-around tools package that rivaled that of nearly all the shortstop prospects in the class, and it's no surprise the ORGANIZATION, who have made no secrets about aggressively pursuing top-level athletes in the ORGANIZATION, took him in the second round of the ORGANIZATION and gave him a bonus slightly over pick value ($1.4 million) to sign him away from his commitment to GPE has a sound right-handed swing and employs a line-drive, all-fields approach. He's not very physical right now but has some quickness to his bat and deceptive strength that could develop into 12-15 home run power. He'll flash some plus run times and is aggressive on the bases.GPE shows smooth actions and soft hands at shortstop. He has a solid arm and good instincts that enable him to make plays. If he doesn't provide enough offense to make it as a regular, he has the athleticism and tools to play a variety of positions in a utility role.",-1
"When the ORGANIZATION signed PERSON out of GPE in Nov. 2014, he was a scrawny 5-foot-8 lefty who tipped the scales at about 165 pounds. The southpaw with an excellent feel for pitching is now 5-foot-11 and around 180 pounds, and that physical maturity has translated to his performance on the mound, though he spent time on the disabled list in 2017 with a forearm strain.Held back in GPE Spring Training until last June to monitor his workload, PERSON' strong performance at age 19 in the ORGANIZATION was one of the pleasant surprises in the ORGANIZATION' system and enabled him to jump up to the ORGANIZATION State League in 2017. He has average stuff across the board, starting with a fastball that now sits 90-91 mph. His changeup is a tick above average and his breaking ball should give him a third Major League average offering. All of it plays up because of his outstanding command and an understanding of how to mix his pitches to keep hitters off-balance.PERSON isn't going to blow anyone away with his stuff, but there are plenty of lefties in the big leagues who fit a similar profile. Just 20 for all of 2017, his feel for pitching could let him move a little more quickly, with the end result being a back-end starter at the highest level.",-1
"The Twins are no strangers to scouting for talent in GPE. There was PERSON back in 1997, PERSON in 2002, PERSON in 2007 and, more recently, left-handed pitching prospect PERSON. PERSON came on the GPE-to-Twins system pipeline in August 2014 and had a very strong GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2015. He didn't pitch competitively in 2016 until late June, but when he did so, he went straight to the full-season ORGANIZATION, where he competed very well as a 19-year-old lefty starter.Small and wiry, PERSON doesn't look like much on the mound but he's shown a combination of pitchability and command that are intriguing. He's also seen an uptick on his stuff. PERSON was throwing in the mid-80s during extended spring training a year ago, but had a close-to-average fastball by the end of the year. There could be more in the tank if he can add some strength. His changeup is ahead of his curveball right now, a more reliable weapon, but both should be at least PERSON average. He throws strikes with all three pitches and his delivery comes with a good amount of deception.Just 5-foot-8, PERSON' ceiling might be somewhat limited, but if it all clicks he could be a crafty lefty who fits nicely into the back of a big league rotation.",-1
"PERSON wasn't a big name in scouting circles leading up to the 2017 Draft, but he still intrigued enough with this tools and remaining projection to earn a selection in the fifth round by the ORGANIZATION. A two-way player at FACILITY (GPE) High, he signed for slot value, passing on a commitment to ORGANIZATION Community College.PERSON shows a quick bat with present raw power from the right side of the plate, though there is some length to his swing that leads evaluators to question the future utility of his hit tool. In the outfield, he has the speed and range to stick up the middle, while the well above-average arm he showcased on the mound as a prep would also make him a clean fit in right.The ORGANIZATION have had success in the past with drafting and developing raw, high-ceiling outfielders, with PERSON and PERSON serving as current examples. PERSON will need time to refine his game in the Minors, but the ORGANIZATION are hopeful he can follow a similar path.",-1
"Another in a line of GPE pitchers to come out of the GPE, PERSON was compared to 2015 ORGANIZATION first-round pick PERSON. He wasn't quite as advanced as the ORGANIZATION prospect was coming out of high school, but he showed enough during the spring to land in the second round, where the ORGANIZATION signed him for more than $400,000 below pick value.The 6-foot-4 right-hander has the makings of a solid three-pitch mix. He can touch 94 mph with his fastball and sits comfortably around 92 mph, throwing it with good sink and without a ton of effort. His 78-80 mph curveball is an average breaking ball now and he has a good feel for his 79-81 mph changeup. He's around the zone with all three offerings and he's a decent athlete, so he should continue to repeat his delivery well. There is some drop and drive in his mechanics at times, but nothing that can't be corrected. PERSON's room to add strength combined with coming from a colder climate add up to a good amount of projection. It may take some time, but with patience he could end up being better than many of the high school arms taken in front of him.",-1

"While PERSON has hogged most of the headlines from the FACILITY' 2016-17 international class, PERSON has developed into one of the system's best middle-infield prospects. Signed for $325,000 out of GPE in July 2016, he has a chance to develop average tools across the board. He has yet to break out offensively, however, in part because he has been one of the youngest regulars in his league in each of his three pro seasons.A right-handed hitter with fine hand-eye coordination, PERSON has been able to make consistent contact against more experienced pitching. With his ability to barrel that ball, combined with his strength and bat speed, he could develop 15- to 20-homer power. To reach his offensive potential, he'll need to adopt a more disciplined approach and drive more balls in the air.Because PERSON has average speed and figures to slow a bit as he matures physically, it has been assumed that he'll wind up at second or third base. But he may have a better chance to stick at shortstop than initially expected because his instincts help him make plays. His strong arm will fit anywhere in the infield, enhancing his utility profile if he doesn't hit enough to be an everyday player.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION outspent every other club by paying $8.4 million on bonuses during the 2013-14 international signing period, blowing past their pool allotment and getting barred from paying more than $250,000 for any player in 2014-15. They had no restrictions last year and were aggressive again, starting with a $2.1 million bonus for PERSON, one of the best all-around athletes in his international class.Like his cousin, former big leaguer PERSON, he stands out most for his speed. PERSON is more of a plus runner while PERSON was a burner, but the younger PERSON has the potential to do more damage at the plate. He's a switch-hitter with a good stroke from both sides of the plate and the potential to produce 15 or more homers per year once he matures physically.Signed as a 16-year-old from the ORGANIZATION, PERSON is both raw in many phases of the game and advanced for his age and background. He'll need to improve his pitch recognition and his center-field defense, and the ORGANIZATION are so confident that he'll do so that they brought him to the GPE during his pro debut in 2016. He also has a solid arm that will allow him to play all three outfield positions if needed.",-1

The cousin of former big league stolen-base champ PERSON, he spent the entire 2018 season in Class A Advanced and played in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON as a 19-year-old. Advanced for his age, PERSON has perennially been one of the youngest regulars in his leagues, but he batted just .253/.315/.351 in his first three pro seasons.A switch-hitter, PERSON has been slightly more effective as a lefty but has a good swing from both sides of the plate. He has advanced bat-to-ball skills but needs to get stronger and more selective so he can make more quality contact. While he won't ever be a slugger, he has the bat speed and projectable frame to develop at least 15-homer power.PERSON' basestealing is also a work in progress, as he's still learning how to use his plus speed on the bases. He's already one of the best outfield defenders in the Minors, a no-doubt center fielder whose solid arm is better than most at the position. His game presently resembles that of PERSON, though the ORGANIZATION believe he'll develop at the plate and reach a higher offensive ceiling.",-1

Once he adds strength, he could develop the power to hit 15 or more homers on an annual basis. His best tool is his plus speed.As someone who signed as a 16-year-old out of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON is still raw in many phases of the game, such as pitch recognition and center-field defense. At the same time, he's advanced for his age and background. He should be able to remain in center, but if not his solid arm will play well in right field.",-1

He hit .385 in a short stint in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION, ranked as the ORGANIZATION. 1 prospect in the Rookie-level PERSON and short-season GPE leagues, and established himself as the top position prospect in the ORGANIZATION system.Taveras is a legitimate five-tool center fielder. A switch-hitter with a good stroke from both sides of the plate, he understands the strike zone and already shows a feel for recognizing pitches. He has bat speed and makes consistent hard contact, so he could develop into a high average/high ORGANIZATION player with average power once he fills out.Taveras' plus speed makes him a basestealing threat, though he's still learning the nuances of that art.

"A cousin of former big league stolen-base champ PERSON, PERSON signed for $2.1 million out of the ORGANIZATION as one of the top athletes on the 2015-16 international amateur market. The ORGANIZATION brought him to the GPE at age 17 and have promoted him aggressively, making him the youngest regular in the short-season LOCATION during his 2016 debut, the third-youngest in the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION last season and the second-youngest in the high Class A ORGANIZATION this year. While he hasn't posted huge numbers, he also hasn't been overmatched and his tools have been obvious.Taveras is a switch-hitter with a good swing from both sides of the plate -- the consensus is that he's better as a left-handed hitter -- and he already displays command of the strike zone and the ability to recognize pitches. Add in his plus speed and he should have little difficulty hitting for average. With his easy bat speed and projectable strength, he also could grow into at least average power once he matures physically.While Tavares still is learning how to translate his quickness into stolen bases, he already uses his speed well in center field.

He makes consistent contact from the right side of the plate with a swing that's direct to the ball and fuels his middle-away approach. He has present pop to the gaps and could grow into some over-the-fence power, though it will never be a major part of his game.Defensively, PERSON, an average runner, is solid if unspectacular at shortstop, where he's an instinctual player who makes all the routine plays and is fundamentally sound. While not explosive in his actions, PERSON is athletic and earns praise from club officials for his intuitiveness and positioning.",-1

The ORGANIZATION signed him for $825,000 in July 2017, then pushed him straight to the ORGANIZATION last year for his pro debut. At age 17, PERSON was nearly three years younger than the circuit's average player. He held his own, though, hitting .250 with a near equal number of strikeouts (17) and walks (16) over 37 games. PERSON is a sum-of-all-parts player who stands out more for his all-around game than any specific tools. He makes consistent contact from the right side of the plate, showing feel for hitting the ball back up the middle and the other way with a swing that's compact and direct to the ball. He'll never offer much, if anything, in the way of over-the-fence power, but PERSON should tally his share of doubles and triples once he gets stronger and finds the gaps more consistently.Defensively, PERSON, an average runner, is a solid defender at both middle-infield positions.

"Some clubs considered GPE the most athletic prospect on the 2013 international amateur market, and his five-tool potential earned him a $1.4 million bonus out of the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION brought him straight to the GPE for his pro debut as a 16-year-old, and though his bat has yet to get going, scouts remain dazzled by his potential.GPE's quick right-handed bat and his projectable strength give him the potential for plus power. While he has yet to enjoy much success at the plate, he shows signs of pitch recognition and doesn't swing and miss excessively. Add in his plus speed, and he could be a 20-20 player once he matures physically and as a hitter.GPE's speed and well-above-average arm allow him to play any of the outfield positions. He's still learning how to make proper reads and routes but should be able to stay in center field.

"Few players can post a .528 OPS in their pro debut and still earn positive reviews from scouts, but few players can match GPE's raw tools. They were evident even as he struggled as the youngest batting qualifier in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League in 2014, and they earned him a $1.4 million bonus when he signed out of the ORGANIZATION Republic the year before.Though GPE still has to make plenty of adjustments to handle pro-caliber pitching, time is very much on his side because he'll play most of the 2015 season at age 17. He has the bat speed and projectable strength to develop plus power. His right-handed swing isn't the smoothest, but he shows the makings of plate discipline and doesn't swing and miss wildly, so he could hit for average as well.While GPE already has started to fill out and has lost a step since signing, he still grades as a plus runner. His reads and routes need some work but he should be able to stay in center field and has a quality arm for the position.",-1
"Not one of the big, headline-grabbing international signings back in July 2014, PERSON began his ORGANIZATION career in 2015 with a fairly non-descript debut in the ORGANIZATION. He headed back there in 2016, but hit his way to the GPE that summer and managed to work his way up to the ORGANIZATION in 2017.An undersized middle infielder, PERSON has shown an ability to hit for average, with a line-drive approach and excellent plate discipline that belies his teenage years. He does lack strength and his ability to impact the ball could become an issue as he moves up the ladder if he can't add some to his 5-foot-11 frame. He does have solid speed, which helps him on both sides of the ball. He has the range and footwork for shortstop, though whether his arm has enough carry to stay there long-term remains to be seen.The ORGANIZATION did have PERSON move around quite a bit during the early part of his career, as he saw time at three infield positions and the outfield. A utilty role is a likely outcome, but he has been seeing more time at short the past two summers, which does positively impact his value.",-1
"There's a stereotype about young Latino players and the way they hit, that they are aggressive free-swingers who aren't familiar with plate discipline. PERSON, who signed with the ORGANIZATION out of GPE back in 2014, has flown in the face of that misconception, using an incredibly advanced approach at the plate to reach full-season ball as a teenager in 2017.PERSON has plus on-base skills that stand out especially given how young he is. He walked more than he struck out in 2017 and didn't lose his approach at all with the promotion to the ORGANIZATION and brings a career .420 on-base percentage with him into the 2017 season. A switch-hitter, PERSON is small, but isn't frail and is considered one of the stronger players, pound-for-pound, in the system, though power is never going to be a part of his game. His speed will be and he's already shown aptitude for being an efficient basestealer. With an above-average arm, good hands and plus instincts, PERSON can handle playing shortstop on a daily basis if needed.At age 20 for all of 2018, PERSON will still see a lot of time at the premium position, but will continue to work at other positions, partially because of the presence of players like PERSON, but also to improve his value via versatility. He could be a utility man when all is said and done, but if he settled in as an everyday middle infielder, no one would be surprised.",-1
"PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION out of GPE for a modest $40,000 back in July 2014 and while he's moved slowly, he immediately stood out because of his advanced approach at the plate and unusual plate discipline. A very solid 2017 season that saw him reach full-season ball for the first time as a teenager had the organization excited for what might come next, but the middle infielder struggled to find his footing in a full ORGANIZATION season in 2018.One thing PERSON did not lose was his ability to see pitches and draw walks. In fact, he finished second in the ORGANIZATION with 84 free passes, but with that came a huge strikeout spike. Given his lack of power, a 25 percent K rate isn't going to fly, with the switch-hitter perhaps being too selective at the plate at times and not choosing good pitches to hit. While he doesn't lack strength, he didn't impact the ball as successfully as he had previously. He does have the speed to steal some bases, but wasn't particularly efficient on the basepaths in 2018.PERSON has split time between shortstop and second thus far in his career, though he saw more much more time on the left side of the infield in GPE. He has the arm, hands and instincts to stay there, but unless he steps forward with the bat, he's destined to a role as a defensive-minded utility man.",-1
"PERSON was emerging as a top high school prospect in GPE Virginia when he made the move to ORGANIZATION in GPE after his sophomore year. He took advantage of the opportunity, showing off premium arm strength against top competition. He also became good friends with shortstop PERSON, who he now gets to call a professional teammate after the D-backs took PERSON in the 11th round and PERSON in the eighth, giving the right-hander an above-pick-value bonus of $350,000 to sign.Right now, PERSON is all about a big fastball. He sat 92-93 mph consistently and was up to 95 mph at times this spring. His slider, which has 10-to-4 action with solid bite and depth, gives him a breaking ball that will be at least average. It can get slurvy at times, but he made strides with it this spring. He didn't use a changeup in high school games, though he has shown some feel for a fringy one in bullpen sessions. ORGANIZATION has been an issue at times for the big right-hander, with some feeling his high-tempo delivery and mindset point to a future in the bullpen. The D-backs didn't sign him to make him a reliever right away and he'll be given every chance to develop as a starter.",-1

PERSON rarely sends its high school picks straight to full-season ball, but that's precisely what it did with PERSON, who responded to the challenge with an eye-opening showing in Class A Kane County's starting rotation. A 6-foot-4 right-hander with a pair of plus pitches and plenty of room for growth, PERSON has all the ingredients teams look for when projecting a future big league starter. He sits at 92-94 mph and bumps 95 mph with his fastball and has present feel for commanding it to both sides of the plate. His two-plane slider is a legitimate swing-and-miss offering that registers in the low-to-mid 80s with hard bite, and he's made strides in learning to command the pitch in his first full season. PERSON's changeup is a distant third pitch right now, but he throws it with splitter-like action that plays nicely off of his heater, and scouts expect it to be at least average once fully developed. PERSON's high-tempo delivery led to questions about his control and command profile and many evaluators pegged him as a future bullpen piece coming out of the GPE. But the big right-hander has already simplified his mechanics in pro ball by working exclusively from the stretch, and in turn he's already made gains with his command.",-1

He has the kind of swing that could allow him to hit for a lot of power. He's shown some feel to hit with a solid approach as well, drawing walks during his ORGANIZATION debut in 2014, though he struggled a bit more during his first time in the GPE a year ago. Big and left-handed, PERSON reminds some of PERSON. Initially an outfielder as an amateur, he quickly moved to first base due to his well-below-average speed. He's a capable defender with a solid arm.If PERSON can watch his conditioning and continue to refine his approach, he could fit the profile of a run-producing first baseman in the future.",-1

He didn't back that up with a strong performance in the ORGANIZATION State League in 2018 and a fractured right thumb sidelined him in late July. A return to the level in 2019 seems to have done wonders for PERSON, and he reached Double-A for the first time in June, then was sent to the ORGANIZATION in return for PERSON reliever PERSON and PERSON pitcher PERSON close to the ORGANIZATION Deadline.PERSON's value lies in his offensive potential from the left side of the plate. He had shown an ability to make consistent contact and drive the ball to all fields in the past, though lost his way in 2018. He rediscovered his stroke in 2019 and is starting to tap into his tremendous raw power, especially to the pull side, setting a career high in home runs. Even when PERSON struggled, he kept his strikeout rate low and never really tried to sell out for power. A below-average runner, PERSON will be a first baseman only and should be capable enough to not be a liability there.A return to a much more refined approach at the plate has helped PERSON get back on the prospect radar.

He has tremendous raw power, as much as anyone in the system. And he's starting to show he's more than just an all-or-nothing home run hitter. He has the abilty to make solid contact, squares the ball up pretty consistently and can drive the ball to all fields, which should allow him to tap into that power in games even more consistently. While he's played some right field and has a solid enough arm for that, he will be confined to first base in the future. The good news is he's more than capable defensively there and his bat is looking like it should profile just fine.PERSON will have to continue to watch his conditioning so he doesn't become a DH-only type, but all signs are pointing in the right direction with a solid full-season debut in 2017.",-1

PERSON has the chance to be a special hitter. He has an impactful swing from the right side of the plate, with plus bat speed that enables him to smash good velocity and make consistent barreled contact, and it's easy to envision him developing some game power as he adds strength to his projectable frame. He has an advanced approach for a teenager and already shows the ability to recognize spin and control the strike zone, with his plus speed that aids him on both sides of the ball.A pure shortstop in the eyes of the D-backs, PERSON has already made huge strides defensively and has the actions, hands and arm strength needed to stick at the position long term. While his remaining physical projection could lead to a move off of the position down the road, PERSON's bat could enable him to profile at a host of positions on the diamond.

The ORGANIZATION signed both GPE and PERSON once the window opened for them to do, giving PERSON $850,000 to join the organization.PERSON's carrying tools are on defense. With a live and lean athletic body, the middle infielder has outstanding instincts at short, with soft and steady hands and more than enough arm to stay at the premium position long-term. The teenager does have a solid approach at the plate, walking more than he struck out during his ORGANIZATION debut. He does make consistent contact with a line-drive approach, but at present, lacks the strength in his small frame to truly impact the baseball.Just 17, there is time for PERSON to develop physically, and patience will be important. Added strength could allow PERSON to reach his ceiling as an everyday shortstop at the big league level in the future.",-1

The teenaged infielder showed a really advanced approach, especially that he was 17 years old at the time, walking more often than he struck out. He makes a lot of contact with a line-drive approach, but lacks current strength to do much more than put the ball in play. Believers feel he will be able to add to his frame, which will allow him to become a more impactful hitter.

The infielder, who initially signed for $1 million with PERSON in July 2016, got $850,000 in December 2017 to join the ORGANIZATION, then went out and surprised many with a very productive organizational debut in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION.Soto showed an advanced approach at the plate, especially given his age, from the get-go in his pro debut with the ORGANIZATION in 2017. He rarely struck out and drew plenty of walks, but didn't have much to show for it production-wise because of a lack of strength. By the time he reached the ORGANIZATION with the ORGANIZATION, he had gotten much more physical, and while he's never going to be a home run hitter, the added strength allowed him to impact the ball more consistently to the point where some feel he could be an above-average hitter if he continues to commit to that part of his development.While he played on both sides of second base in 2018, there's no question he can handle shortstop with a strong arm and terrific hands. If the advancements with the bat are for real, he could be an everyday shortstop, with a pretty high floor thanks to his glove.",-1
" GPE school players taken in the 26th round of a Draft are easy to lose sight of.

Back with PERSON in the Class A Advanced California League in 2019, some increased velocity has made some sit up and take notice of the undersized right-hander. PERSON thrives with plus plus command of a four-pitch mix. Velocity-wise, his fastball is average, though he's throwing harder than he has previously, in the 90-94 mph range. But it plays up thanks to his pinpoint control and good riding life. His changeup is below-average, but he plays it well off of his fastball with a little arm-side run and good late bottom to it. He manipulates his above-average slider in the zone and adds shape to it when expanding it late in counts. His curve doesn't have a ton of shape to it, but he can put it wherever he wants. He'll throw all four of his pitches at any point in the count to keep hitters guessing. PERSON's ceiling is limited given his stuff, but he pitches to his strengths and always sticks to his gameplan. At best, he could be a No. 5 starter, with more of a long or middle relief/swingman look to him. It will be interesting to see if his ability to pitch will allow him to have continued success as he moves up the ladder.",-1
"As a GPE high schooler, PERSON emerged as an early-round prospect for a handful of teams late in the 2016 Draft process. He ultimately turned down the ORGANIZATION as a 30th-rounder to attend ORGANIZATION, where his father PERSON had played en route to a big league career. Much like former ORGANIZATION star PERSON, an GPE first-rounder in 2018, PERSON has confounded evaluators with the dichotomy between his success with metal bats (.939 ORGANIZATION, 42 homers in two-plus years with the ORGANIZATION) and struggles with wood (.570 ORGANIZATION, three homers in two summers in the ORGANIZATION). The A's believed in his bat enough to take him in the first round and give him full pick value, $2,424,600, to sign.A switch-hitter, PERSON has had some timing issues at times at the plate and a swing that can get long, leading to strikeouts. His strength and leverage do generate plus raw power and there should be more in-game pop as he fills out his lanky 6-foot-3 frame. He runs well, producing plus run times occasionally, and can use his speed to steal bases and cover ground at shortstop. While he's a little tall for the position, his athleticism and strong arm should allow him to stay there long-term, and that's where he played exclusively during his pro debut in the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League.If scouts had been convinced that PERSON was going to hit with wood, he probably would have been the first college shortstop taken in June's first round. His athleticism and offensive potential still made him the fifth one taken and if he can figure things out with his swing, he could be a dynamic up-the-middle player.",-1
"The two best draftees ever out of PERSON are currently carving up hitters in the big leagues. PERSON, whom the ORGANIZATION took in the middle of the first round after a slightly up-and-down junior season as he pitched through a bout of mono, hopes to be the next in line after PERSON and PERSON ORGANIZATION. The right-hander didn't pitch at all in his first summer as a pro after signing for full pick value.PERSON has a strong track record of using a solid four-pitch mix and throwing them all for strikes. He showed just what he's capable of when 100 percent healthy while winning PERSON of the Year honors as a sophomore, then being named a ORGANIZATION Cod League All-Star that summer. He sat in the mid-90s, touching 97 mph on the ORGANIZATION and then saw his velocity dip while he was sick, though it ticked back up closer to GPE time. He's gotten bigger and more physical this offseason, so don't be surprised to see some 70-grade fastballs in there in 2019. He can throw two distinct breaking balls, with the harder slider better than the curve, and can mix in an effective changeup as well.With a history of throwing strikes, PERSON could have plus control when all is said and done. He did something Kluber and ORGANIZATION didn't: get taken in the first round. Now it's time for him to get going towards catching them in the big leagues.",-1
"After a strong sophomore season at PERSON that included PERSON of the Year honors, PERSON turned in an All-Star showing in the ORGANIZATION over the summer. He started out his junior year without the same velocity he showed on the GPE, but his fastball ticked back up as the spring progressed and he performed well enough to be among the better college pitching options available, finishing with a 11-2 record, a 2.76 ORGANIZATION and an ORGANIZATION I-leading 163 strikeouts as part of a PERSON staff led all DI programs with a 2.66 ORGANIZATION. PERSON became the ORGANIZATION' first first-round pick in June, going to the ORGANIZATION 14th overall and then signing for slot value ($3,883,800). PERSON sat in the mid-90s and touched 97 mph over the summer, but he pitched more in the 91-92 mph range and touched 94 mph early on before creeping back toward the mid-90s late in the spring. At times his two breaking balls can blend together, but his slider is better than his slower, ""get me over"" curveball. PERSON's changeup might be his best pitch, though some scouts would like to see him use it more frequently. His arm and delivery works well and he throws strikes.The ORGANIZATION hope that PERSON -- the first pitcher PERSON has drafted in the first round since PERSON in 2011 -- will follow in the footsteps of former PERSON products PERSON (ORGANIZATION' fourth-rounder, '07) and PERSON ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION ninth-rounder, '10) and one day headline a big league rotation. Meanwhile, with his impressive four-pitch mix and track record of durability, PERSON could be one of the first hurlers from his class to reach the Majors.",-1
"PERSON replaced two-way star PERSON (the ORGANIZATION. 4 overall pick in the 2017 Draft) at first base for ORGANIZATION in 2018 and ranked third in ORGANIZATION Division I in walks in each of his seasons as a starter, drawing 63 as a sophomore and a school-record 72 last spring. He led the ORGANIZATION with 29 walks in 40 games during the summer in between, establishing himself as one of the most patient hitters and top first-base prospects in the 2019 Draft. The ORGANIZATION drafted him in the second round and signed him for a well-below-slot $997,500.PERSON's offensive game resembles that of ORGANIZATION, who has had more success as a pitcher in pro ball. He's a left-handed hitter with plus raw power who focuses more on making contact and getting on base. He has good feel for hitting, controls the strike zone and could develop 20-plus home run power if he adopts a more aggressive approach and starts driving more balls in the air.While PERSON has well-below-average speed, he's not a terrible athlete. He shows soft hands and a decent arm while getting the job done at first base. Some scouts who saw him as an amateur though he had a chance to play left field while others didn't think that was feasible.",-1
"The 2015 international amateur class was headlined by a group of GPE prospects who received seven figure bonuses to sign. PERSON, a GPE outfielder, was a little more under the radar, though he was the ORGANIZATION' biggest signing that period with a $450,000 bonus. His 2016 debut in the ORGANIZATION was somewhat pedestrian, but his combination of tools and feel for hitting during his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2017 opened many eyes. He didn't replicate that production with a jump to full-season ball in 2018.PERSON has shown an advanced feel for the strike zone and ability to barrel up the baseball that belies his age. The teenager walked more than he struck out in the ORGANIZATION and showed an ability to drive the ball to all fields. While he's not particularly big, his bat speed does help him generate more power than expected, with all of his over-the-fence pop coming to his pull side at present. He's at least a plus runner and should be a basestealing threat, especially as he learns more about reading pitchers. That speed also plays in center field, where he could be a plus defender long-term, with an above-average arm.It's easy to get excited about PERSON's tools and upside, but it's important to be patient and not pile too many expectations on him based on those projections. His advanced feel for the game may make it hard to pump the brakes as he could play his way up the organizational ladder.",-1
"Signed by the ORGANIZATION in July 2015 out of the ORGANIZATION for $450,000, GPE burst on the prospect scene with a very strong GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2017, leaving everyone excited to see what he would do as an encore. The speedster did finish fourth in the organization with 30 steals in 2018, but did not respond well overall to an aggressive push to the full-season LOCATION League.GPE's kryptonite in 2018 was the offspeed pitch. He hits fastballs very well and feasted on them in the ORGANIZATION, but once he started getting a steadier diet of breaking balls and changeups, he often found himself diving and not seeing them come in because of head movement. He's working on fine-tuning his swing so he can stay centered and on his backside longer so he can recognize and respond to the soft stuff better. There is still confidence that the more he sees off-speed pitches, the more he'll learn to recognize it and get back to looking like the top-of-the-order catalyst he was in 2017. The rest of his game is still very good, from the speed to wreak havoc on the basepaths, to playing a very good defensive center field.GPE will be playing at age 20 for most of the 2019 season, so there's still plenty of time for him to figure things out. He did end the 2018 season on an upswing. If he can carry that over, in addition to the other adjustments he's working on, he can get back to reaching his potential as an every day sparkplug who plays up the middle.",-1
"A month before the ORGANIZATION spent $63 million in bonuses and penalties to sign PERSON, they found a bargain on the international market in PERSON. They signed him out of GPE for $35,000 in February 2015, and moved him to center field after he had worked out for clubs as a shortstop. He has transitioned to his new position well and led the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League in hits (62) and doubles (14) during his 2016 GPE debut.PERSON's signature tool is his well above average speed. He's still learning to make the most of his quickness on the bases but it already plays well in center field, where he shows advanced instincts. The solid arm strength that he displayed at shortstop is an asset in center.At the plate, PERSON displays impressive bat-to-ball skills. He won't ever have a lot of power, though he can sting some balls into the gaps and might hit 10-12 homers annually in his prime. He makes a lot of contact but could use some more patience at the plate to enhance his on-base ability and give him a chance to use his speed.",-1

After working out for clubs as a shortstop, he moved to center field and was named the organization's Latin GPE program player of the year in his first taste of pro ball. His GPE debut in 2016 also went well, as he led the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League in hits (62) and doubles (14).PERSON has a chance to have four solid or better tools, with his well above-average speed (which projects as plus once he's physically mature) standing out the most. While he's still refining his skills as a basestealer, his quickness already plays well in center field, where he shows advanced instincts. The solid arm strength he showed at shortstop is an asset in center and also will allow him to play either corner.PERSON has uncanny bat-to-ball skills for a teenager and could develop into a high-average hitter. While he makes easy contact, he could use more patience to improve his on-base ability and maximize the use of his speed. That will be important because he's not very physical and won't ever be a power hitter, though he can sting some balls into the gaps.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION had four Draft picks over the first two rounds of the 2015 Draft. The quartet of picks turned out to be a GPE Clemente High School sandwich, with PERSON going in the first round and his battery mate, PERSON, being the last of the four chosen. While PERSON has moved quickly, PERSON was slowed by a torn meniscus during his pro debut, then struggled to hit in the LOCATION in 2016. Known as a glove-first backstop, PERSON tore his meniscus during his pro debut in 2015 then struggled to hit during his first full season in the LOCATION, though he fared a bit better in his return to the level in 2016.There is no question about PERSON's catch-and-throw skills. He's very agile, blocks well, has great hands and a strong arm that plays up even more because of his quick release and accuracy. He's taken quickly to things like game-calling, having done some of it in high school, and has excellent leadership skills and an ability to work well with pitchers. PERSON has struggled to hit, but he has strong hands and raw power at the plate but needs to continue to refine his approach and plate discipline to get to it.PERSON doesn't have to hit a ton to move up the ladder and he's shown he works well with the young arms in the ORGANIZATION system. He will have to get the bat going a little in order to catch up with them.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION spent a lot of time at FACILITY in the spring before the 2015 Draft. PERSON was their first-round pick and they took his batterymate PERSON one round later. The catcher tore his meniscus in the third game of his pro debut and while he recovered enough to return at the end of the year, the ORGANIZATION decided to err on the side of caution.PERSON was one of the better defensive catchers in the 2015 Draft class, with excellent all-around skills behind the plate. He's very agile and has good hands, already has game-calling experience and gets high marks for his leadership ability. Arm-strength wise, he's a tick above average, but he is as accurate as there is behind the plate, and he could even get better with some corrections to some small mechanical issues. PERSON is far from a glove-only catcher. He has very strong hands and wrists with good power from the right side of the plate.The ORGANIZATION believe PERSON has the chance to be an everyday catcher who makes major offensive contributions.

He has excellent catch and throw skills to go along with the natural leadership teams covet in a catcher. He moves well behind the plate, with excellent hands and blocking skills. While he is definitely defensively-oriented, he's certainly not a zero with the bat. He takes a clean path to the ball with a simple setup, using his extremely strong hands and wrists to drive the ball at times.

An average runner with a solid arm, though how his arm bounces back from surgery remains to be seen, PERSON has excellent hands and his natural instincts should allow him to stay at shortstop long term.

"The ORGANIZATION were encouraged by how PERSON responded to an aggressive push to the GPE League for his GPE debut in 2015 after having signed him for $300,000 in July 2013. A shoulder injury in 2016, after he hit over .300 the prior summer, forced him out for most of the season.

The result was a career-high 12 home runs across 112 contests after he had hit four homers in 250 games during his first four seasons. He's continued to add strength, too, leading some to believe he may hit for even more power going forward. His feel to hit leaves something to be desired, though he does put together solid at-bats and has a willingness to draw walks. He has the defensive chops to play shortstop regularly, but primarily has played second base in the wake of his shoulder surgery. An average runner, he's smart enough to swipe some bases but needs to improve as a basestealer.The ORGANIZATION believe the 2019 season will be a telling one for PERSON, and their hope is that his overall game will begin to come together after he showed flashes of ability early in his career.",-1
"Because of a maturity beyond his years, the ORGANIZATION felt comfortable letting PERSON, who signed in 2013 for $300,000, make his GPE debut in the GPE, up a half-step from a typical start in the ORGANIZATION. He responded by hitting over .300, but the excitement from that was tempered when a torn labrum that required surgery forced him out for nearly all of the 2016 season.Because of his plus work ethic, PERSON did make it back for 20 games at the end of the year and was able to participate in instructional league play. After a healthy offseason, he is expected to be ready to go and pick up where he left off. While he doesn't have a ton of power -- there might be some more extra-base pop as he matures -- he does make consistent hard contact and can send line drives to the gaps, employing a solid approach at the plate. He has the defensive skills to stay at short, with good hands and what should be enough arm to stay there if needed, but he'll likely start out at second base, at least to ease his shoulder back into things.PERSON's plus makeup should help ensure he makes it all the way back to his pre-surgery level of play on both sides of the ball.

With the bat speed and leverage he generates from the right side of the plate, the ball jumps off his bat and he could produce 20 homers per season in his prime. He'll need to make more consistent contact to get the most out of his pop, and club officials believe he's intelligent enough to make those adjustments.All three of PERSON's games in 2017 came at shortstop, though it's unlikely he'll stay there. He's an average runner who figures to lose a step as he gets stronger, making second base (where he spent most of his debut) the best-case scenario and third base another possibility.

After flashes of dominance in 2018 during his first stateside campaign, PERSON was lights-out in his return to Class A Short PERSON as a 21-year-old in 2019.The epitome of a power pitcher, PERSON uses his lightening-quick arm to generate big-time velocity, with a fastball that can touch 99 mph and holds in the mid-to-upper 90s even as he works deeper into games. Beyond the velocity, PERSON' loose arm and angle to the plate gives the pitch explosive late life. His curveball gives him a second plus pitch, thrown with huge vertical depth and hard, 12-to-6 downer action that befuddles same-sided hitters. PERSON' changeup is a work-in-progress third pitch for him, but he'll also flash above-average to plus with it at times, throwing it with diving, splitter-like action in the upper 80s. PERSON is an imposing presence on the mound and heavier than his listed weight of 180 pounds, but he's also athletic for his size and has very loose arm action. There is effort in his delivery, however, and he'll struggle to repeat it at times, but club officials are quick to note the gains he's made on that front early in his career, and especially in 2019. There's impact starting pitcher upside if PERSON can continue to refine his mechanics, develop a more consistent third pitch and refine his overall command. If not, the big right-hander could become a dynamic late-inning reliever with his fastball-curve combo.",-1

Challenged by the ORGANIZATION with a full-season assignment at age 18 in 2018, he made relatively quick work of the Class A GPE ORGANIZATION and then performed well as the ORGANIZATION's youngest player after a July promotion. Along the way, PERSON suited up for the World team as the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON's youngest player.PERSON has a knack for making good contact across the entire field using a quick, hands-y swing from the left side of the plate. His hand-eye coordination and feel for the barrel translate to plus bat-to-ball skills, and it's easy to envision PERSON hitting for more power as he continues to add strength and understand his swing. He's lost a step since signing, but still has at least above-average speed and is lauded as a smart baserunner.A sure-handed shortstop with quick feet and clean actions, PERSON anticipates well and has enough range to make all the routine plays, with plus arm strength that's a fit anywhere on the infield. His remaining physical projection leads some scouts to believe he's best suited long term for second base, and he saw time both there and at the hot corner in 2018.

The left-handed hitting PERSON has a knack for making good contact, especially in the inner half of the plate. But like most prospects his age, the 16-year-old has raw hitting mechanics and will need to refine his approach at the plate. He's expected to be able to drive the ball to all fields once he improves on the minor flaws in his batting technique, though he may never offer much in the way of over-the-fence power. On defense, PERSON has shown decent footwork and good hands at shortstop, with enough range to make all the routine plays and a strong that's ideal for the position.

A product of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON ranked No. 9 on ORGANIZATION's list of the Top 30 international prospects for the 2016-17 signing period before signing with GPE for $1.3 million. He lived up to expectations during his impressive pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, as evaluators raved about the teenager's present combination of hitting ability, speed and defense. Those qualities have been on full display in PERSON's first full season, as he made relatively quick work of the LOCATION League and received a promotion to Class A Advanced Potomac in July at age 18. Two weeks later, PERSON suited up for the World team as the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON's youngest player.PERSON has a knack for making good contact across the entire field using a quick, hands-y swing from the left side of the plate. Scouts believe he'll drive the ball more consistently with better incorporation of his core and lower half in his swing, and there's plenty of room left for PERSON to grow in to his projectable frame. A plus athlete who is a near plus-plus runner, PERSON proved an adept baserunner during his pro debut and should continue to pile up stolen bases during his ascent of the ORGANIZATION. A sure-handed shortstop with quick feet and clean actions, PERSON has enough range to make all the routine plays, with plus arm strength that's a fit anywhere on the infield. He'll only get better as he gains experience, too, and there's little doubt among evaluators regarding his ability to stick at either middle-infield position.",-1

"Sometimes it takes a young prospect to get his professional legs under him, especially if it's a young player just signed out of the ORGANIZATION. Then there are prospects like PERSON, who signed with the Phillies for $2.5 million in July 2017 and hit the ground running, making his professional debut in the GPE and winning the ORGANIZATION League batting title in 2018.It's hard not to get excited about PERSON's tools, though it should be tempered with the fact that much of it is projection and the teenager has a long way to go. He's still not very big, with strength gains to come, but he showed a solid approach from both sides of the plate during his debut, making consistent contact and drawing some walks. There's raw power to tap into there and it should come as he matures. His defensive acumen might outstrip his bat, at least for now. He has a strong and accurate arm that flashes better than plus, a quick first step, quick hands and outstanding athleticism.It's easy to see PERSON becoming the best prospect in the system in the future and eventually be thought of as one of the top shortstop prospects in the game. He could battle the ""other"" PERSON, the ORGANIZATION' prospect on the Top 100, for ORGANIZATION shortstop supremacy.",-1
"Ranked No. 7 on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list, PERSON's defensive acumen and offensive upside excited enough for the ORGANIZATION to spend $2.5 million to bring him into the fold. While data in games won't show up until this summer, PERSON did make a strong first impression in the ORGANIZATION and at instructs with his feel for the game at such a young age.One of the bigger things that stood out was PERSON's glove at shortstop. He has plus range, excellent hands and good footwork, with a plus arm that really stands out. Given that he's just 17 for all of the 2018 season, there are obvious strength gains that will need to occur, but there's confidence that will come as he starts to mature. There are some ingredients at the plate the ORGANIZATION already like, including a solid approach at the plate that doesn't feature too much free or wild swinging. He exhibits some balance from both sides of the plate with barrel control.This isn't the kind of investment that brings a quick return. The ORGANIZATION knew they were in it for the long game when they signed PERSON. Now it's time for him to start his long path up the organizational ladder.",-1
"Once upon a time, PERSON de PERSON was a veritable shortstop factory in the ORGANIZATION, sending All-Star-caliber players to the GPE. PERSON, GPE. 7 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 International prospects list when the July 2 signing period opened this summer, hopes to be the next in that line. The ORGANIZATION clearly agree he has the chance to do just that, giving him $2.5 million to sign.While PERSON isn't the biggest guy in the world, he does flash plenty of tools and potential. He has outstanding defensive skills, with solid range to all directions, good hands and footwork, though it's his plus arm that stands out the most. He should have no problem staying at short long-term.While his glove is ahead of his bat, he's not an all-glove, no-hit type. A switch-hitter, PERSON has a short and quick swing geared toward contact and line drives, without much power. With his speed, he might be best suited for the top of a lineup if it comes together for him, especially if he can add some strength to his 5-foot-11 frame.",-1
"PERSON was 20 1/2 -- ancient by international standards -- when he signed for $20,000 out of GPE in July 2017. He has continually gained velocity in the two years since turning pro and has missed lots of bats wherever he has gone. Working in the mid-90s for most of 2019, he earned a promotion to Class A Advanced in early June.PERSON's fastball parked in the upper 80s when he signed and sat in the low 90s in 2018 before taking another jump this year, peaking at 97 mph. He has developed a changeup with intriguing fade that helps him keep left-handers at bay. After using a slow curveball as his main breaking ball in the past, he has added a harder slider that shows more promise.To remain a starter, PERSON will need to further refine his secondary pitches and improve his control and command. Some scouts think he's destined for the bullpen because he has a short arm action and a lot going on in his delivery. In shorter stints, he might produce even more fastball velocity.",-1
"PERSON didn't hook up with a team at the outset of the 2014-15 international signing period, waiting seven months before the ORGANIZATION gave him a $90,000 bonus. The ORGANIZATION had shoulder surgery following his 2015 pro debut and missed all of the next season before showing flashes of a mid-90s fastball when he returned. When the ORGANIZATION needed roster space after signing PERSON in March 2018, they designated PERSON for assignment and traded him to ORGANIZATION for PERSON.PERSON's big arm stands out in a system filled with big arms, because he regularly operates at 94-98 mph and can reach 101 mph with his four-seam fastball. He keeps his velocity deep into his starts and can blow his heater by hitters up in the strike zone. He can also miss bats with a power curveball that has exceptional spin rates and has begun to work on a changeup that has a long ways to go.The fact that PERSON didn't reach full-season ball in his first four years as a pro testifies to how he's very much a work in progress. He has trouble keeping his delivery in sync and repeating his release point, which makes it difficult for him to harness his overpowering stuff. GPE will keep feeding him innings as a starter because he needs experience, but he may wind up as a dynamic late-inning reliever.",-1
"When he signed out of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON received far less acclaim than some of his fellow right-handers in the ORGANIZATION' 2014-15 international signing class, which included $800,000 bonus baby PERSON and current Top 100 Prospect PERSON. He had shoulder surgery after his pro debut and missed all of 2016, then returned to the mound and flashed a mid-90s fastball last summer. After the ORGANIZATION signed PERSON in March and made room for him by designating PERSON for assignment, they dealt PERSON to ORGANIZATION for PERSON.PERSON has continued to light up radar guns with his new organization, regularly working at 95-98 mph with his fastball and topping out at 101. He has shown the ability to maintain his velocity throughout his starts and get swings and misses with his heater up in the zone. He also eludes bats with his low-80s curveball, which features a high spin rate. He has begun work on adding a changeup to his arsenal.PERSON can overwhelm hitters with his fastball and curveball but he can't always harness them. He's athletic enough to repeat his delivery and doesn't throw with much effort, so there's hope that he can figure out control and command. If not, he still could become an electrifying reliever.",-1
"In a perfect world, every trade acquisition takes a step forward in development following the trade. That's what's happened with PERSON, who originally signed with the D-backs in October 2013 for $160,000. The right-hander joined the ORGANIZATION organization via the 2017 PERSON deal for PERSON. In his first full year with the ORGANIZATION, the ORGANIZATION hurler was a ORGANIZATION All-Star, earned a promotion up to the GPE, performed very well there and earned a spot on the 40-man roster.The 6-foot-3 right-hander saw his stuff tick upwards in 2018 and the results followed suit. His fastball is trending up, and he was sitting low-90s last year, touching 94 mph, throwing the pitch with sink to get ground-ball outs. He gets swings and misses with it and his above-average slider also misses bats, with the sharpening of his stuff leading to a higher strikeout rate. His changeup is developing and is behind the other two offerings.PERSON has always been a good strike-thrower, and he didn't lose that with the uptick in his stuff. The next step will be command within the zone so he doesn't get hit as much as he has, but even that was trending in the right direction. He could have a chance to start, but that fastball-slider combination could play well coming out of the bullpen.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION haven't had much success on the international market in recent years, but they hope their 2018 class could signal a change. PERSON ($2.6 million) and outfielder PERSON ($1.1 million) landed the largest bonuses and most of the hype, but PERSON also has plenty of promise. Signed for $725,000 out of GPE, he has destroyed Rookie-level ORGANIZATION pitching during his 2019 pro debut.PERSON' forte is making consistent line-drive contact from the right side of the plate. He has a sound approach but puts the barrel on the ball so easily that it may cut into his walk totals. Listed at 5-foot-11 and 160 pounds, he's not imposing yet he has deceptive strength and the bat speed to develop average power once he matures physically.PERSON earns solid to plus grades for his speed and has the aptitude to steal bases. He reads balls well in center field and his solid arm strength will play in right should he lose a step and have to move to a corner. He developed advanced instincts in all phases of the game while growing up in a family that includes several cousins in pro ball, most notably FACILITY outfielder PERSON and ORGANIZATION shortstop PERSON.",-1
"There may not be a prospect in baseball with a bigger gap between his ceiling and floor than PERSON. He first reached triple digits with his fastball shortly before he signed for $280,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2015, but he remains much more thrower than pitcher four years later. He logged a 6.25 ERA with 46 walks in 36 innings while repeating the Rookie-level GPE League last season.PERSON has electric arm speed that generates 95-100 mph fastballs with little effort, peaking at 102 with some cutting action. His high-spin curveball gives him a second plus-plus pitch at its best, combining power in the low 80s with sharp break. His low-90s changeup has splitter action and gives him a third weapon that can make hitters look silly. PERSON is athletic and has no glaring flaws in his delivery, helping his chances of developing at least the decent command he'll need to succeed. Some observers believe his strike-throwing issues are more mental than physical. He has the upside of a frontline starter with a more realistic expectation of becoming a difference-making reliever, and the ORGANIZATION will give him plenty of time to figure things out.",-1
"After spending more than $17 million during the 2014-15 international signing period, the ORGANIZATION were prohibited from spending more than $300,000 on any international prospects the next two years. That didn't stop them from landing an explosive arm in July 2015, when they inked GPE for $280,000 out of the ORGANIZATION. He began flashing a triple-digits fastball shortly before he signed and has done so more frequently since.GPE has an exceptionally quick arm that consistently generates 95-100 mph heat. Both of his secondary pitches have a chance to be plus pitches as well. He has advanced feel for spinning a power curveball and shows aptitude for using a changeup.As exciting as his stuff is, GPE is still just 18 and extremely raw. He's more thrower than pitcher at this point, and he's still in the early stages of figuring out how to harness his overpowering arsenal. Though he's not very physical and his control will need to improve significantly, GPE will develop him as a starter for now.",-1
"As a penalty for blowing well past their 2014-15 international bonus pool by shelling out $17 million in bonuses, the ORGANIZATION were limited to spending no more than $300,000 on any individual international prospect during the next two signing periods. They still remained active and may have found a bargain when they landed GPE for $280,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in July 2015. He began hitting 100 mph with his fastball shortly before he turned pro and now has the best pure stuff in the system.GPE isn't physically imposing but has an exceptionally quick arm that repeatedly delivers 95-100 mph fastballs that top out at 102 and feature some cutting action. Both of his secondary pitches have a chance to be at least plus pitches as well. He has a power curveball with a high spin rate and a 90-92 mph changeup with splitter action that can devastate hitters, especially if they're trying to sit on his heater.GPE is still young and extremely raw, so he'll need time to reach his lofty ceiling as a frontline starter. He's has yet to learn to tame his electric stuff, though GPE believes he can develop at least average control and command because his delivery doesn't feature much effort. The ORGANIZATION are loaded with quality pitching prospects, and he could be the most successful of them if he can add some polish.",-1
"PERSON PERSON wasn't the only promising outfielder whom the FACILITY landed in their 2016-17 international class. Signed for $428,000 out of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON is still a work in progress but offers intrigue as a potential prototypical right fielder. He made his GPE debut in 2018 but probably won't advance to full-season ball until next season.It's easy to dream on PERSON' power potential because he has a physical 6-foot-3 frame, a nice left-handed stroke and the ability to make consistent contact. He needs to refine his approach at the plate, however, because he swings at everything and often puts pitches into play that he'd be better off avoiding. He has the upside of a .260 hitter with 25 homers per season.Though he's a below-average runner who doesn't offer much on the bases, PERSON showed enough athleticism and instincts to get most of his playing time in center field during his first two pro seasons. He has shifted to right field in 2019 and has the plus arm strength for the position.",-1
"PERSON trained in the same Venezuelan program that produced GPE rotation stalwart PERSON, and the two right-handers had similar stuff and builds at the same stage of their careers. Signed for $375,000 in 2015, PERSON topped the Rookie-level PERSON in strikeout rate (12.2 per nine innings) in his GPE debut two years later. He was leading the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in whiff rate (11.4) last summer before he was promoted to low Class A at age 19 in August.PERSON's projectability appealed to GPE and he already has started to deliver on it, with his fastball increasing from the upper 80s when he signed to the mid 90s with a peak of 98 mph and quality sink in 2018. His advanced changeup is his best secondary offering and could develop into a second plus pitch. The GPE have encouraged him to throw his curveball more often and he also has a harder slider, both of which are solid at their best.Though he repeats his delivery better than most young, tall pitchers, PERSON has seen his control regress in 2019. In the past, he threw consistent strikes from a three-quarters arm slot that creates angle and movement. He has the upside of a No. 3 starter but will need to do a better job of locating his pitches to fulfill that potential.",-1
"Signed for $375,000 out of GPE at the outset of the 2015-16 international period, GPE made his professional debut the next year in the ORGANIZATION. He made the jump stateside to the Rookie-level PERSON in 2017 and opened eyes with his bat-missing ability, as GPE ranked among circuit leaders with 12.2 strikeouts-per-nine (first), a 28 percent strikeout rate (first) and 70 strikeouts (second). Promoted to Class A Short PERSON in 2018, GPE set a franchise record by striking out 12 batters in his third start of the season. PERSON of a 90-mph fastball when he signed, GPE now operates at 91-94 and routinely tops out at 96-97 mph. The fact that GPE gets good extension over his front side makes his heater play up and nets him whiffs inside the strike zone. He has good feel for a trio of secondary offerings, and each of them could grade as average-or-better offerings once fully developed. While some evaluators prefer his curveball to his slider, and others vice versa, they all agree that GPE's changeup could wind up being his best secondary pitch. Listed at 6-foot-4, 170 pounds, GPE is physically advanced for his age but still requires some projection, and some scouts expect him to add even more velocity as he adds strength to his frame. The GPE will bring the teenage righty along slowly, but the final product could be that of a mid-rotation start if all clicks.",-1
"PERSON may not have come with the type of fanfare like the other players signed by the ORGANIZATION during their 2016-17 international spending spree, but the GPE right-hander could end up being the best of the bunch. After finishing his 2017 pro debut as a 17-year-old in the Rookie-level PERSON, PERSON made the jump straight to the Class A ORGANIZATION and dominated against older hitters before hitting his workload limit and being shut down for the season late in August.PERSON is both athletic and physically strong for his age, with present feel for throwing and locating four pitches. His quick right arm generates a fastball that's been up to 98 mph and usually sits in the low-to-mid-90s with late life thanks to his extension toward the plate. PERSON's power slider in the upper 80s is a swing-and-miss offering, and he also shows aptitude for executing an above-average curveball as well as a changeup that stands to improve as he gains experience. He's consistently around the zone and could have at least above-average command once fully developed.PERSON already shows durability and holds his velocity deep into starts. His delivery and arm action require further refinement like so many young, live-armed hurlers, but he has the requisite athleticism and physical tools needed to make the proper adjustments.",-1
"PERSON looks like yet another promising prospect to emerge from the ORGANIZATION' 2016-17 international spending spree. Signed out of GPE, PERSON made his pro debut in 2017 in the ORGANIZATION before advancing stateside and thriving in the Rookie-level PERSON at age 17. The ORGANIZATION deemed PERSON ready for full-season assignment in 2018, and he quickly rewarded the organization with stellar showing as an 18-year-old in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON is both athletic and physically strong for his age, with present feel for throwing and locating four pitches. His quick right arm generates a fastball that's been up to 98 mph and usually sits in the low- to mid-90s with late life thanks to his extension toward the plate. PERSON's curveball is a swing-and-miss offering that he throws with good depth and late, top-to-bottom bite, and he also shows aptitude for executing an improving changeup as well as a power slider that he throws in the upper 80s.

"The most touted GPE prospect since PERSON, PERSON joined his former national team teammate in the FACILITY organization when he signed for $26 million in GPE (the FACILITY also paid a matching overage tax penalty). That's the second-highest bonus ever given to an amateur, behind only the $31.5 million the ORGANIZATION paid PERSON two years earlier. PERSON has a long track record of success in international tournaments and GPE leagues, including batting .401/.526/.687 as an 18-year-old in GPE's PERSON in 2016.While they play different positions, PERSON has a lot of similarities to PERSON. A right-handed hitter, PERSON pairs electrifying bat speed that should translate into considerable power with well above-average speed. Both come with some swing-and-miss concerns, though PERSON's didn't really surface until he reached Double-A.Considered more of a solid runner when he defected, PERSON has gotten quicker and recorded sub-6.3 second times in the 60-yard dash.

He has performed well in pro ball when healthy, but he had minor knee and ankle injuries in 2017 and has missed much of this season after damaging ligaments in his left thumb.PERSON has the advantages of being a switch-hitter and an infielder, but otherwise PERSON is quite similar to him. A right-handed hitter, he has a lightning-fast bat with well above-average raw power and speed to match. He also comes with some swing-and-miss concerns, though he mitigates them somewhat with his willingness to take walks.Considered more of a solid runner while in GPE, PERSON got faster after defecting and posted sub-6.3 second 60-yard dashes while trying out for teams. His lean 6-foot-3 frame has plenty of room for additional muscle, so he'll probably slow down some as he matures physically. He could remain in center field and has the solid arm strength to profile in right field if he has to move to a corner.",-1
"â¢ 7/18: PERSON off to hot start in Triple-AShortly before new rules severely curtailed international bonus payments, the FACILITY signed PERSON for $26 million -- the second-highest ever for an amateur -- and a matching amount as a tax penalty in May 2017. They expected him to move quickly after he had batted .401/.526/.687 as an 18-year-old in GPE's top league in 2016, but his first two pro seasons were shortened by knee, ankle and thumb injuries. He finally began to showcase his exciting package of tools in the ORGANIZATION last offseason, a prelude to putting up monster numbers in 2019 while rising from PERSON to Triple-A.Though he's not a switch-hitter or an infielder, PERSON has a lot of similarities to PERSON, who set the amateur bonus record with $31 million from the ORGANIZATION before they sent him to GPE in the ORGANIZATION trade. He has electric bat speed, well above-average raw power and speed, and the upside of solid or better tools across the board. Also like PERSON, the right-handed hitter comes with some swing-and-miss concerns and will need to improve his plate discipline to realize his offensive potential.PERSON went from showing solid speed in GPE to clocking sub-6.3-second 60-yard dashes during the tryout process, and even if he loses a step as he matures physically, he could be a 30-30 player. He's still a bit raw with his reads and jumps in center field but he has the physical ability to become a solid defender up the middle with more experience. If he has to move to a corner, his strong arm and offensive profile will fit well in right field.",-1
"PERSON began boxing in the ORGANIZATION before he played baseball, leaving the sweet science behind when he signed for $200,000 in 2016. After two years in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION, he came to the GPE in 2018 and ranked third in the Rookie-level GPE League in on-base percentage (.446) and fifth in batting (.348). When the ORGANIZATION determined they didn't have a role for J.D. PERSON on their big league roster, they sent him and infield prospect Cody Bohanek to GPE in a January trade for PERSON, outfielder PERSON and catcher PERSON Manea.PERSON has exceptional bat-to-ball skills, as evidenced by his .329 average with a mere 9 percent strikeout rate in his first three pro seasons, and he displays good patience and the ability to use the entire field. Despite standing 5-foot-8, he has a quick right-handed swing and deceptive strength that could translate into 12-15 homers per season if he can start driving more balls in the air. He tends to dive toward pitches, which means that a lot of his hard contact comes in the form of ground balls.An average runner who plays with lots of energy, PERSON has good instincts on the bases and in the field. He's a reliable if unspectacular defender at second base. He has seen some action at third base this year, though his below-average power and arm make it tough for him to profile there.",-1
"PERSON was eligible to sign out of the ORGANIZATION in 2015 but didn't land a contract until the following summer, when the ORGANIZATION gave him a $200,000 bonus. He made an impressive GPE debut in 2018, ranking third in the Rookie-level GPE League in on-base percentage (.446) and fifth in batting (.348). The ORGANIZATION acquired him in January, along with outfielder PERSON and catcher PERSON in exchange for J.D. PERSON and infielder PERSON Bohanek.Two things stand out with PERSON: his knack for contact and his high-energy play. His career has been brief, but he's always hit, with a quick swing and very few strikeouts. He might never be a huge power guy, but he is capable of driving the ball with more strength than you'd expect, and he already is showing a very advanced approach at the plate and a willingness to draw walks. He's an average runner who should be capable enough at second defensively.PERSON loves to compete and his makeup, when combined with his hit tool, gave the ORGANIZATION confidence to jump him over the ORGANIZATION up to the ORGANIZATION in 2018. That ability to swing the bat should carry him up the ladder, and if he can maintain that approach, a future as an everyday offensive-minded second baseman awaits.",-1
"Restricted to giving out no more than $300,000 in individual international bonuses in 2017, the ORGANIZATION paid the maximum amount to seven different prospects. The best of that group is ORGANIZATION, a Dominican who ranked third in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION with 10 homers in his 2018 pro debut.Despite that slugging display, ORGANIZATION's hitting ability and approach may be better than his power. He shows good feel for the barrel from the left side of the plate and walked in 19 percent of his plate appearances in the ORGANIZATION. He has nice loft in his swing, drives the ball in the air and could have 20-homer pop once he adds more strength.Though ORGANIZATION is a below-average runner, PERSON believes he'll be able to remain at third base and may give him a chance to show what he can do at second base.

While productive, he's also had a string of scary injuries: a hairline fracture and ligament/muscle damang in his left arm in 2017, then a broken fibula and torn ankle ligaments in his left leg this past spring. The ORGANIZATION liked PERSON's power potential enough to take him No. 75 overall, and he returned to health and reached full-season ball quickly during his pro debut.PERSON has tremendous strength and leverage thanks to his 6-foot-4, 265-pound frame.

Yes, there's length to PERSON's right-handed swing, but he displays solid control of his swing and walked more than he struck out during his ORGANIZATION career, rarely expanding the zone when he was pitched around.A solid athlete for his size, PERSON is nonetheless limited as a runner and defender.

The 6-foot-2 right-hander was up to 96-97 mph with his fastball at times, sitting comfortably in the 93-94 range. His breaking ball can be inconsistent; some scouts have seen two distinct pitches, others have seen them blurring into one slurvy offering. But he's shown enough glimpses of an above-average 78-83 mph breaker to think he'll get there consistently with more reps. He'll show a usable changeup in the bullpen but doesn't throw it much in games.PERSON's athleticism helps him on the mound and he should continue to repeat his delivery and find the strike zone consistently as he develops.

Facing signing restrictions in '18 after spending heavily on international talent the year prior, the ORGANIZATION managed to sign PERSON for $300,000 in July 2018. Subsequently assigned to the ORGANIZATION, PERSON hit .415/.497/.774 with 13 home runs and 59 RBIs in 44 games to win the circuit's triple crown.PERSON is physically mature for his age, with a broad, thick frame that's loaded with strength. It helps him generate plus raw power that he should be able to get to in games because he's also an advanced hitter with a plus bat speed, feel for the barrel and a swing that stays in the zone for an extended period of time.

Improvements to PERSON's velocity and control enabled him to start putting it all together and reach Class A Hagerstown in 2018 before an oblique injury prematurely ended his season in GPE. When he's healthy, PERSON has impressive stuff. His three-pitch mix is headlined by a mid-90s fastball with late movement that he locates well enough that it helps set up his changeup, an above-average offering that he throws with mid-90s velocity. PERSON's slider is a quality third pitch, and he throws everything with a bit of deception thanks to a slightly lower arm slot. While PERSON's delivery isn't the cleanest and he at times will look limited athletically due to his size, he generally repeats his delivery well and throws strikes with all three pitches.

He displays impressive bat speed from both sides of the plate, though he'll have to tighten his strike zone and make more consistent contact to fulfill his promise at the plate.PERSON's defensive game needs some polish as well after he led the ORGANIZATION with 35 errors in just 52 games. If he can't settle down, his tools also would play well in center field, though PERSON has no plans to move him off shortstop anytime soon. He has done a good job of adding strength since signing and now carries 195 pounds on his 6-foot frame.",-1
"PERSON set a GPE bonus record when he signed for $1.3 million out of GPE in 2013. Lower-leg injuries curtailed the GPE in his pro debut last year, though he still showed glimpses of five-tool talent.A switch-hitter, PERSON is better from the left side of the plate. He's extremely raw at the plate, which is no surprise given his background, but his bat speed leads the Royals to believe he could have close to average power once he adds some much-needed strength. He's still learning the strike zone, as evidenced by his 34/4 K/BB ratio in his debut. When healthy, PERSON has plus speed. He has good actions and range at shortstop, and his arm has gotten stronger since he signed. He'll need to improve his defensive consistency after making committing 15 errors in 22 games in 2014.",-1
"When PERSON signed for $1.3 million out of GPE in 2013, he eclipsed the GPE bonus record of $800,000 set by GPE's ORGANIZATION Kepler four years earlier. Though he has some of the best tools in the system, his first taste of full-season ball last year produced a .196/.256/.293 line with 48 errors -- 10 more than any other Minor Leaguer. He has had more success in 2017 while repeating low Class A and moving from shortstop to the outfield.Given his background and youth, the ORGANIZATION knew PERSON would need a lot of time to develop, and they are willing to give it to him because of the potential payoff. A switch-hitter with good bat speed from both sides, he shows better-than-average raw power during batting practice, but he's still extremely raw at the plate in terms of his approach, plate discipline and pitch recognition.PERSON's most usable tool at this point is his plus speed, though he's still figuring out how to steal bases. His quickness and arm strength are suited for shortstop, but he lacks soft hands and committed 98 errors in 181 games there in his first three pro seasons. He transitioned to center field during instructional league and can become an asset there once he gains more experience.",-1
"Ranked No. 4 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list in advance of the signing period in 2013, PERSON set a record for a GPE prospect when he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $1.3 million July 2.Everything about the GPE infielder is projection right now, with the teenager years away from impacting the roster in GPE. That said, the switch-hitter has shown good bat speed from both sides, and his speed helps him on both sides of the ball. PERSON can hit the gaps, but at least right now, it doesn't look like power is going to be a big part of his game. He has added some strength already, which should help him deal with the rigors of professional baseball.It remains to be seen if PERSON can stay at shortstop, but he does get high marks for his work ethic and makeup, things he'll need to make the long climb up the organizational ladder.",-1
"PERSON intrigued scouts as an athletic catcher before emerging as one of top high school pitching prospects in the country ahead of his senior year. While biceps tendinitis limited PERSON's time on the mound in the spring, the ORGANIZATION, long rumored to have interest in the GPE prep, took him with their first-round pick (ORGANIZATION. 27 overall) and then signed him for $3 million, more than $500,000 above his slot's recommended value. The club cautiously chose not send him out for his pro debut, instead giving PERSON extra rest until instructional league, where he drew rave reviews from those who saw him.An athletic righty with two plus pitches and plenty of room to fill out, PERSON has the look of a future big league starter. He's been up to 97 mph in the past with his fastball and typically sits 93-95, throwing his heater with good life down in the zone. His breaking ball is a high-spin-rate hammer, a plus pitch that he throws in the upper 70s with depth and finish, and he also shows feel for developing a changeup with average-or-better potential. PERSON should have at least average control based on the merits of his sheer athleticism and clean arm action. In addition to his two-way exploits on the diamond, PERSON was also the kicker and punter on his high school's football team. Such a multi-sport, multi-position background underscores just how much upside PERSON has left to unlock now that he's focused on pitching full time. If it all clicks, he could be a ORGANIZATION. 3 starter.",-1
"There were several question marks regarding PERSON, even after a strong summer showcase showing that ended with helping ORGANIZATION's 18-and-under team win a gold medal. Was he a pitcher or a position player? Would he want to do both at the ORGANIZATION of GPE? An accomplished kicker and punter, would he want to keep playing football in college? All of those were trumped somewhat by a biceps issue that sidelined PERSON during spring, although it didn't keep the Nationals from selecting him in the first round as a pitcher. He signed for $3 million, above his slot's recommended value of $2,472,700.PERSON typically started behind the plate when not on the mound, but he'd moved out to the outfield as a senior and dedicated himself to a future as a hurler. He's been up to 97 mph in the past with his fastball, sitting around 94, throwing it with good life down in the zone. When PERSON stays on top of it, his power breaking ball has nasty break and finish to it, and he shows feel for a solid changeup as well.There's some upside here to unlock, given PERSON's split focus, both because of his two-way history on the diamond and his time spent on the gridiron. He has a good, strong body that reminds some of PERSON, with a chance for his stuff to jump once he concentrates on his craft full-time.",-1
"Though he wasn't considered the best pitching prospect at ORGANIZATION (GPE) High at the start of the 2018 season, PERSON surpassed left-hander PERSON with a strong spring. He threw 55 1/3 consecutive scoreless innings to eclipse a state record established by the legendary PERSON and led national prep pitchers with 177 strikeouts in 98 1/3 innings. After earning a complete-game victory in the GPE 5-A state semifinals, he signed with the ORGANIZATION for a well over-slot $1 million as a fourth-rounder.PERSON's fastball jumped from the upper 80s last summer to the low 90s this spring, and he enhances his increased velocity with nice sink and downhill plane. With his athleticism and the projection remaining in his 6-foot-4 frame, his heater should continue to get stronger. He throws two breaking balls, a low-80s slider with late bite and a curveball with more shape than power, and has begun working on a changeup. PERSON has a sound delivery and repeats it well, which bodes well for his control, command and durability. If everything comes together, he could develop into a No. 3 starter.",-1
"Though he hails from a ORGANIZATION (GPE) High program that spawned big leaguers PERSON and PERSON as well as top ORGANIZATION quarterback prospect PERSON (a two-sport star as a prepster), ORGANIZATION was largely unknown entering his senior season. He didn't attend many showcase events and his summer team got little exposure, but scouts and college recruiters rushed to see him once word got out this spring. That lack of track record didn't scare away the ORGANIZATION, who drafted him in the third round in 2017.At 6-foot-2 and 190 pounds with extremely athletic actions, ORGANIZATION already looks like a big leaguer. He generates a lot of bat speed with his loose left-handed swing and gets good leverage out of his projectable frame. There are some questions about his hitting ability because he faced subpar competition in GPE and there's no history of him facing quality arms with wood bats.ORGANIZATION is an average runner out of the batter's box but quicker once he gets going. Currently a center fielder, he lacks the pure speed to stick there long-term but should be a solid defender with an average arm on the outfield corners.",-1
"As teams get to the later rounds of the GPE, they rely heavily on the area scouts, who put in the work to really know players and finding value. The ORGANIZATION leaned on PERSON scout PERSON, who was on PERSON's offensive upside from the get-go and knew what it would take to sign him. The ORGANIZATION gave PERSON well above the $100,000 threshold in the 17th round to sign him away from his GPE commitment and he promptly went out and led the ORGANIZATION in home runs, on-base percentage and slugging.PERSON impressed immediately, and throughout his pro debut, with his professional at-bats. He has an advanced approach from the left side of the plate, particularly for a high schooler, drawing walks and not even giving in to left-handers on the mound. He has the chance to be at least an average hitter with above-average power if this continues, and was hitting balls over the center field wall in GPE during instructs. The son of a body builder, PERSON is no stranger to the weight room and could approach plus power eventually.A well below-average runner, PERSON played some outfield during his pro debut, but he is now a first baseman only with work to do to be adequate defensively. It will be his bat that carries him, however, and after struggling with an assignment in full-season ball, he righted the ship when he was sent down to the GPE League in 2018.",-1
"A high school prospect from the ORGANIZATION, PERSON showed considerable raw power as the ORGANIZATION approached in 2017. It was enough for the ORGANIZATION to give him $350,000, well above the $100K threshold, in the 17th round to sign him away from attending PERSON. He opened a lot of eyes by leading the ORGANIZATION in homers, on-base percentage and slugging in his debut summer, but struggled with a move to full-season ball in 2018 that necessitated a drop down the GPE League. He returned to the LOCATION League to start the 2019 season.PERSON's power is still very much his calling card and he showed plenty of over-the-fence pop when he moved down to the ORGANIZATION last year and at the start of this season. With it comes a considerable amount of swing-and-miss from the left side of the plate, though he does help mitigate the strikeouts a bit with a healthy walk rate. He's gotten a bit leaner from a conditioning standpoint, without sacrificing any of his strength, and that should help him be a better all-around player who isn't just relying on hitting balls over fences.  A below-average runner, PERSON did play a little outfield at the start of his career, but has played first base exclusively since and will have to work to become adequate there, though his leaner frame will help. He's taken a step back in the right direction in more effectively reaching his power in 2019.",-1
"PERSON starred for the GPE national 15-and-under team as a rising sophomore in August 2013, dominating GPE to win the gold-medal game at the ORGANIZATION championships. He already threw in the low 90s and looked like a potential first-round pick for 2016, but he injured his elbow and had PERSON surgery as a junior and then pitched just one inning last spring. The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their first pick on the third day of the GPE, taking him 85th overall and then giving him $1.75 million, more $1 million above pick value, to lure him away from a GPE commitment.PERSON did hold bullpen workouts for scouts before the GPE, during which he looked as athletic and projectable as ever. He generates easy velocity, reaching 94 mph with some arm-side run and the promise of added heat once he fills out his lanky 6-foot-7 frame. He'll need time to develop his secondary pitches, but he shows the potential for at least a solid curveball and an average changeup.PERSON's athleticism should allow him to throw strikes and his arm works well, giving hope that he'll stay healthy going forward. It's that combination of feel and projection that has PERSON excited about his future.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION took some chances with their loaded 2016 Draft class, selecting a number of high-upside arms. In more than one case they gambled on pitchers returning from injuries. PERSON was one of those gambles, and it appears to be paying off. The tall right-hander was selected in the third round out of PERSON in GPE, after he underwent PERSON surgery during his junior season. He joined the ORGANIZATION organization when they offered a $1.75 million signing bonus - which was $1 million above the slot's value.PERSON's first two professional seasons came at ORGANIZATION A Fort Wayne, with his workload strictly monitored in his return from surgery. He posted a 4.67 ERA as a 19-year-old and a 4.94 mark at 20, while racking up more than a strikeout per inning. The 6-foot-7 right-hander bulked up a bit prior to the 2019 season, which he opened at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Lake Elsinore. He had a healthy April but landed on the injured list with a right elbow injury in early May and didn't return to action until late in July. PERSON's delivery is smooth, and his mid-90s fastball has life. He's athletic for his height, and he should continue to grow into his offspeed pitches. PERSON's slider is his primary putaway offering, and it's easy to forecast the pitch as big league-caliber. His changeup and curveball have potential, too.",-1

"With baseball bloodlines as the son of former big league infielder PERSON, who won the World Series with the ORGANIZATION in 2002, PERSON endeared himself to scouts with his advanced feel and overall knowledge of the game as an amateur. But a strong commitment to PERSON coupled with the fact that PERSON lacked prototypical early-round tools led some to question whether he would be drafted high enough to sign. The ORGANIZATION ended up taking PERSON in the third round, after he had batted .380/.475/.758 with seven homers and 22 steals as a high school senior, and lured him away from his college commitment with an above-slot bonus of $900,000. PERSON is solid in all facets of the game. He's a natural at shortstop, possessing smooth actions and excellent hands that enable him to make all the plays, as well as a quick first step and advanced instincts that give him range in all directions. The low-to-mid-90s fastball that helped PERSON excel as his high school team's closer is also an asset for him as a shortstop, and he earns high marks for his throwing accuracy. He runs well but will never be much of a threat on the basepaths. The ORGANIZATION saw untapped potential in PERSON's right-handed bat when they drafted him, and he's already made significant gains as a hitter early in his career, showing sneaky power potential and a knack for barreling the baseball. And while the progress that PERSON makes at the plate going forward will ultimately dictate his role and ceiling, his defense and contact skills give him a solid floor and could one day help him contribute in the big leagues in some capacity.",-1
"GPE's track record of success stacked up well against that of any college pitcher in the 2019 Draft. He swiftly emerged as PERSON's No. 1 starter and led ORGANIZATION USA with 111 strikeouts in 96 innings as a freshman in 2017. One of two college hurlers (PERSON's PERSON is the other) to reach triple digits in GPE's in each of the last three years, he also pitched with the GPE collegiate national team and won the ORGANIZATION all-star game last summer. That resume led to him being the ORGANIZATION' second-round pick and he signed for a below pick value bonus of $1.1 million. ORGANIZATION USA's 2019 pitcher of the year, GPE usually deals at 90-93 mph and tops out at 96 with his fastball, and his high-three-quarters arm slot creates more downward plane than true life. He has added velocity to his slider, which now arrives in the mid-80s with impressive depth and has become his best pitch. His upper-70s spike curveball has nice downer action as well.Because his breaking pitches have been effective against both left-handers and right-handers, GPE hasn't had to rely on his changeup much at the college level. He has an unorthodox delivery with a lot of effort, leading to some questions about his suitability as a long-term starter in pro ball. But he makes it work and hasn't had any difficulty controlling his pitches, so he'll get every opportunity to stick in a rotation.",-1
"GPE was a bullpen mainstay for ORGANIZATION since his freshman year and set a school record with 14 saves as a sophomore in 2018, when the ORGANIZATION finished runner-up at the ORGANIZATION World Series. He added 10 more saves as a junior, while averaging 13.13 strikeouts-per-nine, en route to becoming the ORGANIZATION' fourth-round GPE pick in June. There's nothing subtle about GPE, who attacks hitters with two plus pitches that feature outstanding spin rates. His 92-96 mph fastball gets great carry in the strike zone, appearing to rise as it reaches the plate. His over-the-top arm slot helps him get nice depth on his plus curveball, which can be a true hammer in the mid 70s and was regarded by scouts as one of the best breakers in the GPE. He battled the strike zone as a freshman before pounding it as a sophomore, though his control did regress this past spring.GPE has a lot of effort and some recoil in his delivery, so there's no thought of trying to deploy him as a starter. He projects as a setup man at the highest level and could get there relatively quickly, with perhaps a chance to close if he provides more strikes.",-1
"In terms of raw all-around toolsets, there were few college hitters better than PERSON in the 2019 Draft class. Some struggles in the ORGANIZATION last summer hurt his stock a bit, and he struggled with swing and miss issues during his junior year, though he helped GPE win the Big Ten Conference regular-season title. The ORGANIZATION grabbed him in the second round and signed him for a below-slot bonus of $1 million, making him the highest-drafted Hoosiers player since PERSON went in the first round of the 2014 Draft.PERSON has a big league body at 6-foot-4 and 198 pounds, and his strength, leverage and bat speed give him plus raw power. But he sold out for home runs as a junior, and scouts were worried about the length of his right-handed swing, his pull-heavy mentality and his lack of pitch recognition. He still could do a lot of damage while making more consistent contact if he employed a more disciplined approach.If he hits, PERSON could be a star. He has plus speed to go with his raw pop and could be a 20-20 player. He has the range to become an asset in center field with more experience, and he has solid arm strength that plays up because of outstanding throwing accuracy. He saw more time in center than anywhere else during his pro debut, but did play all three outfield spots in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League.",-1
"A two-sport star in high school who could have continued to play basketball at ORGANIZATION, PERSON was thought to be the second-best high school right-hander in the GPE class, after PERSON, and the ORGANIZATION nabbed him No. 9 overall and gave him full pick value -- just north of $3.5 million -- to sign him.PERSON is the son of former ORGANIZATION player PERSON and because of his split focus in high school, he's still a bit of a project on the mound. He uses his athleticism and 6-foot-6 frame on the mound exceptionally well, with his extension making his already-plus fastball get on hitters even faster. PERSON was up in the 96-97 mph range during his senior year and in the ORGANIZATION, using his fastball and power curve to miss a ton of bats. He's shown some feel for his changeup, though he didn't throw it much in high school, and it has the chance to be a third at least average pitch in the future.PERSON was around the strike zone a lot during his pro debut and his athleticism should help him repeat his delivery. He gets high marks for his makeup and that, along with his stuff and projectability, give him the ceiling of a frontline starter.",-1
"The son of a former ORGANIZATION player, PERSON was a two-sport star who could have gone on to play both sports at Loyola-Marymount, and when the ORGANIZATION went slightly above pick value to sign him away from that commitment, they knew PERSON might be a bit of a project. The ORGANIZATION have proceeded with understandable caution, holding the 6-foot-6 right-hander back in extended Spring Training to start his first full year of pro ball. He eventually pitched his way from short-season Connecticut to full-season LOCATION, capping his season off with a 10-strikeout performance in the ORGANIZATION playoffs.PERSON has as much, if not more, upside than any pitcher in the ORGANIZATION system, but he also might have the farthest to go to reach it. As he works to refine his delivery, his command and velocity have fluctuated. When he's in sync, he's easily in the low-90s with the ability to touch 95-96 mph with ease. It's easy to dream on more consistent velocity as he figures things out. His power curve has the chance to be a plus pitch in the future, and while his changeup lags behind, he's shown some feel for it and it should give him a third at-least-average offering at his disposal.PERSON's command fluctuated largely because of mechanical flaws, which his athleticism should help him iron out as he progresses. It's going to take time, but the end product could very well be a frontline starter. PERSON started the year on the disabled list with a minor oblique strain.",-1
"The son of former ORGANIZATION player PERSON, this 6-foot-6 right-hander was rushing up lists as the ORGANIZATION approached in 2016, becoming the consensus second-best high school right-hander in the class, behind PERSON. The ORGANIZATION, never ones to shy away from arm strength, took the LOCATION product No. 9 overall and signed him for $3,505,800, exact pick value for that slot.PERSON is a premium athlete, one who also played basketball in high school and could have played two sports at ORGANIZATION. He uses every inch of his frame to his advantage on the mound. Though he started late because his basketball team made a deep postseason run, PERSON was nonetheless up to 96-97 mph with his fastball in early outings his senior year. He combines that with a hard, power curve that has very good bite to it. His changeup will be his third pitch, but he's shown some feel for it and it should be a viable option in the future, especially with pro instruction.PERSON's size, athleticism, stuff and projectability give him top-of-the-rotation potential. Now that he's focusing on baseball only, the sky might be the limit.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION knew that GPE might be a bit of a project when they signed him for slightly above slot value after taking him in the first round of the 2016 Draft. GPE's father, PERSON, is a former ORGANIZATION player, and PERSON was a two-sport prep star who could have gone on to play both sports at Loyola-Marymount. After initially being eased into pro ball, GPE's development took flight in 2018 as he pitched his way from PERSON A to Double-A and led ORGANIZATION Leaguers with 154 strikeouts as a 20-year-old.The 6-foot-6 right-hander generates easy velocity, sitting in the low-90s and touching 95-96 mph, and his fastball plays up because he gets so much extension toward the plate. His power curve is a low-80s hammer that has the chance to be a plus pitch in the future, and while his changeup lags behind, he's shown some feel for it, giving him a third at-least-average offering at his disposal. He's capable of missing bats and inducing weak contact with all three pitches, especially his plus fastball-curveball pairing.The ORGANIZATION have worked with GPE to clean up his mechanics and it's already led to better fastball command, though, overall, he's still learning to repeat his delivery and arm slot. GPE's athleticism and remaining physical projection should go a long way in helping him with that. He has as much upside as any pitcher in the ORGANIZATION' system, with athleticism, size and stuff that point to him becoming at least a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"On the high school showcase circuit before his senior season, PERSON stood out more for his projection than his present stuff. That changed last spring when his fastball suddenly started hitting 97 mph and he became one of the most in-demand prep pitching prospects in the 2017 Draft. The ORGANIZATION took him in the second round and signed him away from an GPE commitment for late first-round money ($2,497,500).After working at 88-92 mph in 2016, PERSON now operates with a 92-95 mph fastball and touches 97, and he maintained his improved velocity through instructional league in the fall. He also showed some power with both a curveball and a slider as an amateur, and GPE will have him focus going forward on his tight curve, which has the upside of a plus pitch. His changeup will require more work because he seldom used his as an amateur.PERSON has the size for durability and the athleticism to throw strikes and make adjustments, so the ORGANIZATION envision him becoming a mid-rotation starter. Some scouts have concerns about his delivery, which features a long arm action and some head whack and crossfire, and think he'll be better suited to be a reliever.",-1
"PERSON's projection stood out more than his present velocity on the high school showcase circuit in 2016, when his fastball sat at 88-92 mph. When his heater touched 95 mph early this year and reached 97 by mid-spring, he became one of the best prep pitching prospects in the 2017 Draft. The ORGANIZATION took him in the second round and signed him away from an GPE commitment for $2,497,500, the equivalent of late first-round money.PERSON's fastball now parks at 91-95 mph and could continue to add velocity, and he uses his size and three-quarters delivery to create run and angle. His best secondary pitch is a mid-80s slider with bite, and he also has some power to a curveball that can be solid at its best. He doesn't have much experience throwing a changeup but his has a chance to become an average offering.While there's no question about PERSON's stuff, there are concerns about his delivery. He has a long arm action and throws with effort, leading some scouts to project him as a reliever in the long run. He has the athleticism to make adjustments and throw strikes, and GPE will develop him as a starter.",-1
"A growth spurt before his senior year led to a big uptick in stuff for GPE, sending his ORGANIZATION stock rising and scouts pouring into GPE as the weather warmed. The D-backs took him in the third round, gave him an above-pick value $1 million bonus and then had him throw sparingly during his pro debut. After getting off to a shaky start at ORGANIZATION A Short PERSON in 2018, GPE finished with a 1.74 ERA over his final 33 frames and then continued to pitch well in is first taste of full-season ball at ORGANIZATION A Kane County in 2019. GPE has impressed with his stuff, pitchability and polish, the latter being particularly impressive given his cold-weather background. Working from an athletic and repeatable delivery, he'll touch 94-95 mph and sit in the low 90s with his fastball, and there's reason to believe there's more in the tank as he fills out his projectable frame. His changeup flashes plus, with the potential to get there long-term, and he also has feel for a slider that can be too slurvy. He threw strikes 70 percent of the time in the LOCATION in 2018, issuing 1.9 walks-per-nine, and should have at least average command in the future.GPE understands how to change eye levels and keep hitters off-balance using his fastball-changeup pairing. Developing a better breaking ball, whether it's a slider or true curveball, is a top priority in GPE's development, and the D-backs believe his athleticism and clean arm action gives him a chance to do so.",-1
"A growth spurt before his senior year led to a big uptick in stuff for PERSON, sending his PERSON stock rising and scouts pouring into GPE as the weather warmed. He ended up landing in the third round, where the D-backs gave him an above-pick value $1 million bonus. He threw sparingly during his summer debut, but stood out as the most exciting high school PERSON prospect from the D-backs' crop of high schoolers selected.While PERSON has a ways to go as a prep pitcher from the LOCATION, the D-backs were pleasantly surprised how polished and mature he was on the mound. He shows three plus pitches at times from an athletic and repeatable delivery. His fastball will touch 95-96 mph and sit in the low 90s and there's reason to believe there's more in the tank as he fills out his frame. He's already tightened up his slurvy breaking ball some into a slider that should be a very good weapon for him and he has feel for a solid changeup. He's around the strike zone and should have at least average command in the future.Showing a good sense of what he needs to do on the mound to improve, PERSON was advanced in his ability to change tempos and deliveries to keep hitters off-balance. The D-backs love his business-like approach to honing his craft and think it will serve him well as he begins his pro career in earnest.",-1
" PERSON was a major pop-up guy in the 2017 GPE class, partially because of playing baseball in GPE, where scouts had to wait for the weather to improve to see him, and partially because a growth spurt heading into his senior year at PERSON led to an uptick in his stuff. That landed him in the third round, where the D-backs gave him an above-pick value deal of $1 million to sign. PERSON's added size led to him being up to 96 mph with his fastball at times this spring, sitting in the 92-93 mph range deep into starts. He has good feel for an average changeup. His breaking ball is slurvy right now, but he has a feel to spin it and he can land it for strikes, with scouts feeling it will likely work better as a slider. PERSON has an extremely quick arm that should work going forward. His command should be average at the next level. PERSON could have gone higher in the GPE, but a rough start in front of decision-makers gave his stock a hit, which worked to the D-backs' advantage.

He led ORGANIZATION USA in homers in each of his first two seasons, totaling 35, putting him in position to become the first first-rounder in GPE Eagles history. A lack of consistency at the place as a junior hurt his stock, dropping him to the ORGANIZATION. 39 overall pick in the ORGANIZATION Round A, where he signed for $1.8 million, a bit below pick value.PERSON's size, strength and aggressive left-handed stroke combine to give him some of the best raw pop in the 2019 college class. He needs to prove he can handle quality velocity and may have to tone down his approach a bit, as he'll chase pitches out of the zone rather than let his prodigious power come naturally. He's shown the ability to draw walks, as college pitchers were loathe to challenge him.Primarily a center fielder in his first two years at LOCATION, PERSON has below-average speed and moved to right field as a junior, the spot he played during his solid pro debut in the Rookie-level GPE. He definitely has the arm strength for right, reaching 97 mph with his fastball and complementing it with a hard slider and splitter as a reliever. Some scouts initially had more interest in him as a pitcher, though he didn't throw in 2019, making it clear his future was as a run-producing outfielder in pro ball.",-1
"ORGANIZATIONt a big name when the summer showcase circuit season began, PERSON proceeded to put himself firmly on the map with consistently strong performances across multiple events. He picked up during the spring at GPE (Fla.) HS where he left off, continuing his climb up ORGANIZATION boards to become perhaps the top high school arm in the class. However, PERSON's reported price tag of $4 million and strong commitment to the ORGANIZATION of GPE deterred many teams from taking him on Day 1 of the 2019 ORGANIZATION. Seeing an opportunity to land one of the ORGANIZATION's best arms, the ORGANIZATION took PERSON with their third-round pick, then selected cost-saving college seniors in each of the next seven rounds to ensure they'd be able to sign him, which they did for $2.5 million, roughly four times his slot value as the ORGANIZATION. 89 overall pick. Big, strong and physical, PERSON has seen all of his stuff play up during his senior season. His four-seam fastball touches 97 mph on a regular basis and he maintains that velocity deep into starts. He'll drive the ball down in the zone, but can pitch up and down with his fastball well, with improved overall command of the pitch both in and out of the strike zone. He complements the heater with a plus power curve he can throw for strikes, missing bats consistently. His changeup has also taken a step forward after he changed his grip on the pitch from a split-fingered to fingered, giving him a third at least above-average pitch.While some scouts don't love PERSON's arm action in the back, it doesn't affect him out front and he's able to command all three of his pitches extremely well, repeating his delivery consistently. With his combination size, stuff and feel, PERSON has all the ingredients teams look for in a potential frontline starter.",-1
"GPE looked like a potential top PERSON pick in 2018 after a stellar summer showcase circuit that concluded with him tossing six scoreless frames in the 18U GPE National Team's gold-medal-winning game against GPE. While his stuff wasn't as electric during his senior year at ORGANIZATION (Ariz.) High, GPE still had a dominant campaign, going 8-1 with a 0.93 ORGANIZATION and 104 strikeouts in 60 1/3 innings. When the PERSON arrived, concerns about GPE's signability caused the ORGANIZATION commit to last until the mid-first round, where the ORGANIZATION were thrilled to find him still available at the ORGANIZATION. 16 overall pick. He signed for slightly below slot at $3,497,500, helping PERSON save the money needed to sign fellow first-rounders PERSON and PERSON, and he performed well during his pro debut at a pair of GPE levels.A 6-foot-5 left-hander, GPE stands out for his combination of stuff and pitchability, with the makings of three pitches that could garner a 60 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale once fully developed. He sits in the low 90s and touches 95 mph with a fastball that plays above its velocity because he's deceptive and gets such good extension over his front side. GPE's curveball is a swing-and-miss hammer, thrown with three-quarters tilt and good spin rate, and he introduced a new, and very effective, slider during the spring. His diving changeup, meanwhile, is another promising pitch, one that plays nicely off his heater and could be his best secondary offering when all is said and done.After ranking as the top left-hander in his class and garnering consideration as a top-five overall pick, GPE now could end up as one of the 2018 PERSON's biggest steals. While he's more advanced than most high school arms in his class and therefore could move comparatively faster than some of his peers, the ORGANIZATION likely will bring GPE along slowly, as they usually do with their high school PERSON picks, giving him the time he needs to develop physically and refine his craft.",-1
"ORGANIZATION stood out on the summer showcase circuit more with his feel for pitching than plus velocity. He threw 12 shutout innings for the 18U GPE National Team, and there was a reason he got the ball for their gold medal game against GPE, won by him thanks to his six scoreless frames. As a ORGANIZATION (Ariz.) PERSON senior, ORGANIZATION continued to boost his ORGANIZATION stock with a lights-out start in ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION in March before finishing with an 8-1 record, a 0.93 ORGANIZATION and 104 strikeouts in 60 1/3 innings. He was widely viewed as one of the ORGANIZATION's top prospects as a result, but concerns over the ORGANIZATION of GPE commit's signability caused him to last until the middle of the first round, where the ORGANIZATION were thrilled to land him with the ORGANIZATION. 16 overall pick. ORGANIZATION signed for slightly below slot at $3,497,500, helping PERSON save the money needed to sign both PERSON and PERSON, whom the club selected with back-to-back picks (ORGANIZATIONs. 31 and 32 overall).ORGANIZATION's pitchability was a separator for him in a ORGANIZATION class deep with high-end high school pitchers. That's not to say he doesn't have good stuff, because the 6-foot-5 lefty has the potential to eventually develop three pitches that could garner a 60 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. ORGANIZATION will throw his fastball in the 89-94 mph range, maintaining the velocity throughout his starts, and he opened some eyes by touching 96-97 mph frequently in the early stages of the spring. He's also made mechanical changes to vastly improve his command of the pitch. ORGANIZATION's curveball is a swing-and-miss hammer, thrown with three-quarters tilt and good spin rate, and he introduced a new, and very effective, slider during the spring. His diving changeup, meanwhile, gives him a third secondary pitch that could be plus when all is said and done.After ranking as the top left-hander in the 2018 class and garnering consideration as a top-five overall pick, ORGANIZATION could now end up as one of the ORGANIZATION's biggest steals. It's a front-of-the-rotation ceiling if all clicks for him, though the ORGANIZATION are expected to bring him along slowly as they usually do with their high school ORGANIZATION picks.",-1
"PERSON's decision to train at the ORGANIZATION was an easy one because the nine-time All-Star is also his uncle. PERSON's top prospect in the 2019 GPE, he generated some first-round buzz and delighted the ORGANIZATION when he was available at the end of the second round. They signed him for an over-slot $1.1 million as the 69th overall selection.Though he's still in need of refinement -- no surprise considering that he turned 18 just before the GPE -- PERSON possesses the potential for at least four solid tools with raw power to match. He has a penchant for making hard contact from the right side of the plate and could develop 20-homer power as he gets stronger. He shows flashes of plus speed but could lose a step once he matures physically.PERSON is raw defensively but GPE is confident he can remain at shortstop once he adds more polish. He's a good athlete with the quickness, hands and arm for the position. Some clubs projected him as more of a second or third baseman before the GPE.",-1
"GPE (GPE) PERSON had the best pair of prep pitching prospects in the 2019 Draft, with the Rays taking J.J. Goss in the supplemental first round and the FACILITY Sox popping PERSON early in the second. The latter announced his presence as a rising junior in October 2017, when he reached 95 mph at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship, but his stock dipped slightly during an inconsistent senior season. The 45th overall pick in June, he signed for $2.1 million.With one of the quickest high school arms in the 2019 class and an athletic delivery, PERSON often sits in the low 90s with his fastball and can touch 96 mph. He compensates for a relative lack of life on his heater by creating plan with his high-three-quarters arm slot. He has shown flashes of a plus curveball, though it was less reliable during the spring than it had been in the past and flattens into more of a slider when he doesn't stay on top of it.PERSON's changeup is still a work in progress yet shows signs of promising deception and sink. He has the ceiling of a No. 3 starter, but he'll have to refine his control and command to reach it.",-1
"PERSON was a solid high school prospect from GPE, one who most figured would be heading to the ORGANIZATION of GPE as the 2016 PERSON approached. The ORGANIZATION had some bonus pool money left over and a good feel for what PERSON wanted to do, enabling them to go over the $100,000 pick value for a post-10th round pick and giving him $300K to sign in the 11th round. While his first full season was limited by some shoulder fatigue early, he did advance to full-season ball in 2018 and finished strong there.Strong and physical, PERSON has the chance to have three usable pitches he can throw for strikes. He was up to 96 mph with his fastball in 2018, sitting mostly in the 92-93 mph range, using both a four- and two-seamer. What he profiles as in the future will be about how his secondary stuff continues to develop. The 6-foot-3 right-hander entered pro ball with a bit of a hybrid power breaking ball that's become more of a firm slider that flashes above-average. His changeup is still a work in progress.The ORGANIZATION have managed PERSON's workload carefully, not sending him to full-season ball in 2018 until late May. He'll continue to start for now, with the gloves coming off as he moves up a rung, with the possibility he ends up as an effective fastball-slider reliever.",-1
"Since the newer Draft rules went into place in 2012 that dictate a $100,000 pick value for all players taken in the 11th round or higher, teams have often gone after talent that slipped because of signabilty in those later rounds. Extra pool money can be used to make a push to sign, but an unsigned pick doesn't count against a team's bonus pool. That's what the ORGANIZATION did with PERSON, signing the FACILITY high school standout away from his GPE commitment for $300,000.While some high school pitchers are tall, lanky and projectable, PERSON comes into pro ball with an already strong and physical frame. His fastball can sit in the low 90s and he has shown a pretty good feel for commanding it within the strike zone. While he has a good feel for a changeup and some aptitude for spinning a breaking ball, those secondary offerings are a bit raw. It's unclear whether PERSON will settle on a curve or slider, but the ORGANIZATION are fine with sending PERSON out with what is a hybrid power breaking ball for now and seeing where his natural athleticism take him.While PERSON might be more physically mature than some high school arms, that doesn't mean there isn't room for growth and an uptick in stuff. That all could come as he gets more reps and refines his delivery over the course of his first full year of pro ball, which was interrupted by shoulder fatigue at the end of extended spring training, delaying his assignment to a short-season club.",-1
"While it can be difficult for high school players from PERSON to gain exposure, PERSON was seen at the ORGANIZATION Games last summer, PERSON's ORGANIZATION World Championship in the fall, and also participated in a Prospect Development Pipeline event in GPE in February. During the offseason, he worked out with the ORGANIZATION' PERSON and his brother, PERSON prospect GPE. After being picked by the Brewers in the ORGANIZATION B of the 2018 Draft, PERSON could one day play alongside fellow PERSON native and 2014 first-rounder PERSON GPE.PERSON profiles as a top-of-the-order catalyst who can impact the game with his speed on both sides of the ball. The right-handed hitter makes consistent contact and projects to be an average hitter. He needs to add strength, but there is some extra-base pop in his swing. He has the kind of speed to steal bases and cover a lot of ground in the outfield, with the chance to be an above-average defender eventually, and a plus arm to boot.In addition to following in GPE' footsteps, PERSON became PERSON's first high school positional player to be selected in the top five rounds since 2013, when the younger GPE brother joined PERSON Kiner-Falefa as fourth-rounders. Both of those players have since had solid careers, with the latter reaching the Majors in 2018. He'll need time to develop, but PERSON has all the ingredients needed to join that select group.",-1
"With his selection by the Brewers with the ORGANIZATION. 73 overall pick in the 2018 Draft, GPE became the first GPE high school positional player to be taken in the top five rounds since 2013. He signed for $550,000, forgoing his commitment to GPE's, then made his pro debut in the Rookie-level PERSON League.GPE makes consistent contact with a simple swing that enables him to use the whole field and leads scouts to project him as an average hitter. Adding strength should help bring out some of the extra-base potential in GPE's swing, but his game power likely will always be below-average. He has the kind of speed to steal bases and cover a lot of ground in the outfield, with the chance to be an above-average defender eventually, and a plus arm to boot.GPE's bat and above-average speed could one day have him hitting atop a lineup. Being able to stay in center field adds value to his overall profile, as GPE lacks the power potential expected from corner outfielders at the highest level.",-1
"The 11th round, at the start of Day 3 of the GPE, has become a spot where teams will go after high school talent that slid because of signability concerns. That's exactly what the ORGANIZATION did in 2018 when they took PERSON and gave him $500,000 ($375,000 of that counted toward their bonus pool) to sign him away from a commitment to the ORGANIZATION of GSP. After pitching briefly in the ORGANIZATION in his debut summer, he's fared well with a move to the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in 2019.PERSON is an athletic right-hander with a three-pitch mix that gives him the chance to start long-term. His fastball sits in the low 90s and will occasionally touch 94-95 mph, thrown with good sink to get a lot of ground-ball outs. He effectively mixes in his breaking ball and his changeup and can throw all three pitches for strikes. PERSON really stands out for his competitiveness on the mound and goes right after hitters.Because of that mound presence and his feel for pitching, the ORGANIZATION feel he has the chance to move a bit more quickly than the typical high school pitcher. That's why they were willing to jump him over the rookie-level GPE League and send him to the NY-Penn League, setting him up to head to full-season ball in 2020.",-1
"The top position prospect in a deep Minnesota high school crop in 2016, PERSON went undrafted because his bat stood out much more than his athleticism. That profile remained true after three years at FACILITY, though he also established himself as one of the best all-around hitters in college baseball and proved himself with wood bats in summer play. An ORGANIZATION performance at the ORGANIZATION tournament in May in front of a crowd of scouts cemented him as a first-round pick, and he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $2,312,000 as the 31st overall selection.PERSON controls the strike zone better than most players, drawing walks when pitchers won't challenge him and attacking hittable offerings when he gets them. He has a sweet left-handed swing with plenty of bat speed, and his balanced approach allows him to drive the ball to all fields. He projects to hit for average and power while drawing plenty of walks, giving him one of the highest offensive ceilings and floors among collegians in the 2019 Draft.Because PERSON has below-average to fringy speed and arm strength, he played mostly first base and some left field for the ORGANIZATION. He has some deceptive athleticism for a 6-foot, 207-pounder, starring in football and hockey as well as baseball in high school. PERSON has opted to push the defensive envelope by breaking him into pro ball at second base, where he saw some action in the ORGANIZATION.",-1
"GPE of the ORGANIZATION' $8.4 million haul from the 2013 international amateur signing period, PERSON signed for $550,000 out of the ORGANIZATION. The most advanced player from that group, he made his pro debut in Double-A as an emergency fill-in last May and didn't look overmatched at two Class A stops or the ORGANIZATION as a 17-year-old.An extremely polished defender, PERSON plays well above his fringy speed at shortstop. He has great hands and instincts, as well as a solid, accurate arm. He saw time at second base in his pro debut and could probably play anywhere on the diamond except for catcher and center field.PERSON's bat will determine whether his future is as a regular or a utilityman. He's a switch-hitter who makes contact and controls the strike zone better than most young ORGANIZATION prospects. He lacks strength and speed, however, limiting his offensive ceiling.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION led all clubs by spending $8.4 million on international talent during the 2013-14 signing period, including $550,000 for PERSON out of the ORGANIZATION. The most advanced player in that crop, he made his pro debut as a 17-year-old emergency fill-in in Double-A in May 2014 and became the youngest player in the history of the ORGANIZATION later that year. PERSON was the second-youngest regular in the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION last season and the third-youngest in the high Class A GPE League this year.PERSON is advanced well beyond his years as a defender. His keen instincts help him play well above his fringy speed, and he has quick hands and a solid, accurate arm. PERSON also has seen time at second base and could play anywhere on the diamond except for catcher and center field.PERSON won't make as much impact as a hitter, though he does a nice job of making contact from both sides of the plate. He uses the entire field and occasionally can turn on a pitch, but he won't be a power threat even after he adds some much-needed strength. PERSON will fit at the bottom of a lineup, but his glove still could make him a big league regular.",-1
"PERSON's electric arm and a strong start to his 2017 sophomore year at LOCATION positioned him as an early-round pick for the next year's Draft -- but those hopes seemed dashed when he blew out his elbow that PERSON and had PERSON surgery two months later. He missed the entire 2018 season but still went in the second round to the ORGANIZATION, who have had recent success drafting pitchers who had or needed elbow reconstructions (PERSON in 2014, PERSON in 2015). He signed for a well over-slot $1,229,500, taking enough out of GPE' bonus pool that it wasn't able to land first-rounder J.T. Ginn.Before he got hurt, PERSON displayed a pair of plus pitches. His fastball ranged from 92-96 mph with running action and his high-spin-rate slider sat in the mid-80s with tremendous depth. His changeup isn't nearly as advanced and he'll need to refine it to succeed as a starter against more advanced hitters in pro ball.PERSON uses his 6-foot-3 frame and high three-quarters arm slot to create downhill angle on his pitches. His control improved from his first season to the second with the ORGANIZATION, and it could continue to get better as he gets more experience. The ORGANIZATION will handle him carefully this year but he should be full go for 2019.",-1
"The biggest surprise on the first day of the 2018 PERSON came when GPE took PERSON in the second round after he had missed his entire junior season at LOCATION while recovering from PERSON surgery. He intrigued scouts with his electric arm in early 2017 but blew out his elbow that PERSON and had it reconstructed two months later. The ORGANIZATION have scored by drafting pitchers who had or needed PERSON surgery (PERSON in 2014, PERSON in 2015) and signed him for a well over-slot $1,229,500 -- which didn't leave enough in their bonus pool to sign first-rounder J.T. Ginn.Though he has been challenged by an aggressive assignment to Class A Advanced for his pro debut, PERSON has shown a pair of legitimate plus pitches. His 92-96 mph fastball featured running and cutting action and his mid-80s slider had high spin rates and tremendous depth. That combination gives him a high floor as at least a late-inning reliever.To make it as a starter, PERSON will have to refine a changeup he didn't use much as an amateur and throw enough strikes to be efficient with his pitch counts. There's some effort in his delivery, though it provides some deception as well. He uses his 6-foot-3 frame and high three-quarters arm slot to create steep downhill plane on his pitches.",-1
"GSP defined PERSON's college career at ORGANIZATION. He posted solid and very similar offensive numbers in each of his three seasons in GPE, and he went 60 consecutive games and more than a year from 2017-18 without making an error at second base. He spent the first half of 2019 as a DH while battling back problems, then returned to the field and played flawless defense in 23 regular-season contests before landing in the fourth round of the GPE, signing for a just-below pick value bonus of $472,500 and heading to the rookie-level GPE League for his pro debut.Using a compact left-handed swing and a controlled approach, PERSON drills line drives from gap to gap. He has exceptional hand-eye coordination and manages the strike zone extremely well, and he continued to provide steady production with wood bats in the ORGANIZATION last summer. He doesn't hit for much power, though his ability to barrel the ball could translate into double-digit home run totals at the next level if he gets more aggressive.An average runner, PERSON makes little impact on the bases but gobbles up plenty of ground balls on defense. He has great hands and an average arm, and he might be able to handle some shortstop duty in pro ball. While he may not have wow tools or a huge ceiling, he owns a high floor as a reliable college bat who can play up the middle.",-1
"The top pitcher in GPE's 2016 recruiting class, ORGANIZATION blew out his elbow in April of his freshman year and returned to the mound a year later following PERSON surgery. He became the ORGANIZATION' closer in 2019 and his ORGANIZATION stock rose when his velocity spiked during a postseason run to the ORGANIZATION World Series. GPE selected him in the third round and signed him for $500,000.ORGANIZATION spent most of the spring working at 93-96 mph with riding life on his four-seam fastball, but the ORGANIZATION saw him hit 99 mph during the ORGANIZATION. He has done a better job of generating velocity without overthrowing this year, significantly improving his ability to command his high-spin heater. He backs it up with a low-80s breaking ball that combines slider power with curveball depth.ORGANIZATION's strong 6-foot-3 frame is built for durability and he's throwing more strikes than ever, so GPE will explore the possibility of making him a starter. To succeed in the rotation, he'll need to develop a changeup after having little use for one in the past. If he winds up in the bullpen, he has a ceiling of a setup man.",-1
"PERSON was a bit of a late riser in the LOCATION ranks, partially because his strong commitment to PERSON had scared scouts off, but mostly because a very strong spring had teams giving him a longer look despite that commitment. Enticed by his combination of present stuff and future projection, the ORGANIZATION went above slot ($2,132,400) to sign the prep right-hander after taking him in the second round.The 6-foot-4 hurler reminded many scouts in the region of GPE, who would be a sure-fire first-round pick this year out of PERSON if he were healthy, when he was a high schooler in the area. PERSON's fastball is typically in the 88-92 mph range, with some room for added velocity from his loose and projectable frame, though he'll likely be more command than premium velocity in the future. He throws a slider and a curve, with the latter a much better offering, buckling knees with sharp bite coming from a high three-quarters slot. He does a nice job of sprinkling in his changeup. He can throw strikes with all four offerings.PERSON's name was moving up ORGANIZATION boards as his strong string of performances continued and some of his contemporaries stagnated or went backwards. It will now be up to the ORGANIZATION to further the right-hander's development.",-1
"PERSON continually impressed scouts during his senior year in the LOCATION prep ranks with his combination of present stuff and feel as well as future projection, though some teams ultimately stayed away from the young right-hander due to his Stanford commitment. The ORGANIZATION were not one of those teams, as they selected PERSON in the second round and then signed him with an above-slot bonus of $2,132,400. The young right-hander proved advanced in his professional debut, making eight strong starts in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. Tall and lanky with long levers, PERSON's frame is loaded with physical projection. While his fastball typically sits in the 88-92 mph range and reaches 94, he's expected to continue to add velocity as he adds strength, especially in his lower half. PERSON also shows feel for throwing a two-seamer that registers in the upper 80s that has late run and sinking action. He throws a slider with cutter action and a curve, with the latter a much better offering, buckling knees with sharp bite coming from a high three-quarters slot. He does a nice job of sprinkling in his changeup. He can throw strikes with all four offerings.PERSON already has proved more polished than many of his Draft contemporaries, but the ORGANIZATION are likely to move him along at a conservative pace as they tend to do with their top prep arms. He'll need time to develop physically and to refine his craft, but the final product could be that of a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"PERSON grew up in the greater GSP area idolizing PERSON and has a chance to be a toolsy professional outfielder in his own right. A fourth-round pick in 2018, many amateur scouts had him as a potential first-rounder but some tinkering of his swing by an outside instructor, to go along with signability concerns, led to a fall. The ORGANIZATION still gave him first-round type money ($2 million) to sign him away from his commitment from the ORGANIZATION of Virginia.An athletic kid who draws some comparisons to PERSON, PERSON has drawn raves for having great instincts in the outfield, especially for a first-year professional who hails from a northern state. He didn't get the type of reps that players from the warmer states get, but is fundamentally sound in all aspects of his defense. PERSON possesses an accurate arm that works behind the ball. He makes good reads and takes good routes and has a chance to be a well above-average defender. His speed should also make him a threat on the basepaths.At the plate, there is still some ceiling for PERSON's hitting with a balanced hitting approach to go along with compactness and directness with his left-handed swing. He could hit for average and have enough power to be interesting as a center fielder. If he grows in size and is moved to an outfield corner, he likely would profile as a fourth outfielder because he may lack the power normally seen from a regular corner outfielder. PERSON gets very high marks for his makeup and work ethic, which should help him maximize his tools.",-1
"Talented and a bit raw out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks in 2016, PERSON was taken in the 35th round by the ORGANIZATION, but he went on to ORGANIZATION. PERSON success in two years of starting with the ORGANIZATION had him poised to be one of the better college bats to be considered in June and while a slow start to his junior season impacted his stock, he got hot as the ORGANIZATION approached. The ORGANIZATION never lost track of him, taking him again, this time in the first round (ORGANIZATION. 23 overall) and signing him for $2.725 million, a bit under pick value. PERSON is a solid athlete, especially given his 6-foot-5 frame that he's still growing into. And as a kid from the LOCATION, he's still growing into the game. He's shown huge raw power from both sides of the plate, with some scouts putting a 70 on his raw power, but there are some questions about his ability to make enough contact to tap into it consistently. He was streaky during his junior year, but showed what he can do when he's locked in. PERSON enough to handle an outfield corner, he's a plus defender at first who can save runs at the infield corner and that's where he played exclusively during his pro debut in the short-season LOCATION League.Just 20 years old when he was drafted, PERSON was one of the youngest college juniors in the country. It's rare to find a college bat with projection, but PERSON does have a pretty high ceiling as a middle-of-the-order run producer if he can continue to refine his approach.",-1
"Reports of PERSON's demise might be a bit exaggerated. The ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in the 2016 PERSON had trouble finding consistent footing during his first season and change as a pro, with concerns about his overall strength to impact the baseball mounting, leading many to feel he was headed toward the list of top picks who didn't pan out. Some adjustments in the second half of his 2018 season in the ORGANIZATION State League, however, might have the outfielder headed in the right direction.The one thing plaguing PERSON early in his career was his tendency for weak contact on the ground, leading some to worry that he wasn't strong enough to drive the ball. In the second half of 2018, however, he started to turn on the ball and drive it to his pull side more frequently and coupled that with better pitch decisions. There's still work to be done there, but he's reportedly already added more strength this offseason to help him show more extra-base thump. He was more consistent defensively as well and showed he could help a team in center field even when he wasn't swing the bat as well.While there's no doubt PERSON needs to prove he can perform over the course of a full season, it's possible there's an up arrow next to his name while others have written him off. If he can start using his strength more consistently, he could prove more doubters wrong in what is a big season in his development.",-1
"A strong performance on the summer showcase circuit last summer put PERSON on the first-round radar. When he kept raking during the spring, adding some power, he moved way up boards and eventually landed in the top spot of the GPE. The ORGANIZATION signed him for $6.1 million, nearly $3 million under pick value, allowing them to aggressively go after talent later in the GPE.While he saved the ORGANIZATION money, he had played himself into a legitimate No. 1-pick kind of player. It's PERSON's hit tool and his ability to stay in center field that really stand out. He makes consistent hard contact against good competition. He has a good approach at the plate, spraying line drives to all fields. It's more doubles power now, but he started to show the ability to drive the ball more this spring and should have more pop as he adds strength to his frame. His above-average speed works on both sides of the ball, and some see a future ORGANIZATION Glove-caliber center fielder.PERSON gets high marks for his baseball instincts and effort, showing an ability to slow the game down as the competition improves. That should bode well for him at the next level, and he's the type who won't let No. 1 pick expectations weigh him down.",-1
"Expectations for a No. 1 overall pick are always going to be high, but PERSON at first seemed ready to at least come close to meeting them with a solid start to his first full season in A ball. His season went off the rails in the second half, however, hampering his prospect status. Hopes for a bounce-back 2018 season were dashed as PERSON wasn't particularly productive in the ORGANIZATION State League.While PERSON really scuffled in the latter stages of the LOCATION season, he did show the hit tool in the opening months that point to a future as someone who can hit for average if he can return to his simple approach at the plate. He is capable of being selective and making consistent hard contact from the left side, but he did neither consistently down the stretch. His speed should allow him to steal bases and cover a lot of ground in center field long-term, though he was inconsistent on that side of the ball at times, too.Added strength should help PERSON deal with a full season of pro ball. There's plenty of time for him to right the ship, and the instincts he's shown in the past should help him learn from his adversity and get headed back in the right direction.",-1
"Hailing from the southern GPE high school ranks, PERSON springboarded from a strong summer showcase to a spring that saw him continue to excel, moving up boards and landing as the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick.

He can flat-out rake, making consistent hard contact from the left side of the plate. He started showing more power during his senior year and he could approach PERSON average pop as a pro. Perhaps more impressive than his innate ability to barrel up the ball is his IQ at the plate, with an approach far advanced for his age and a willingness to use all fields. PERSON runs very well, allowing him to be a threat on the bases and to cover a lot of ground in center field, where he has the chance to be an elite defender.PERSON was already gaining good weight and adding strength last fall, something that served him well in his first full season of pro ball. His instincts, work ethic and natural tools all point to him living up to the expectations usually heaped on a ORGANIZATION. 1 pick's shoulders.",-1
"GPE invested heavily in the international market during the 2015-16 signing period, signing eight players to seven-figure bonuses, including $1.25 million for ORGANIZATION. They have pushed him aggressively, assigning him to the short-season LOCATION at age 18 and having him make his full-season debut at age 19 in 2018. He was up to the challenge, playing his way into the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON and the low Class A ORGANIZATION all-star game.ORGANIZATION's defensive ability and makeup are the traits that initially attracted the GPE, and he hasn't disappointed in those areas. He's a better receiver and moves better than most catchers his age, already showing the aptitude to frame and block pitches well. His arm has gotten stronger since he turned pro and now grades as solid with a chance to become plus, and it plays up because he gets rid of the ball quickly and makes accurate throws.ORGANIZATION's offensive potential also has grown and he has the upside of a solid hitter with power to match. He has nice feel for the barrel, is getting better at managing the strike zone and makes repeated contact from the right side of the plate. He's developing a better understanding of how to tap into his raw power, though he'll need to get stronger after wearing down toward the end of his first year in full-season ball.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION handed out seven-figure deals to eight international prospects during the 2015-16 signing period, including $1 million to land PERSON out of GPE. They were attracted to his work behind the plate and his intangibles, traits that led them to promote him to the short-season LOCATION for his GPE debut last summer. He was the league's best defensive backstop as an 18-year-old and this year has emerged as one of the game's best catching prospects, earning a spot in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON Game.With his agility and soft hands, PERSON is an advanced receiver for a teenager, framing and blocking pitches well. His arm strength is average but plays better than that because he makes quick and accurate throws, and he erased 41 percent of basestealers in the ORGANIZATION. His arm strength has improved since he has signed and he could be a plus thrower once he's fully developed.PERSON is starting to make the same type of impact offensively, showing feel for the barrel and the ability to make consistent contact from the right side of the plate. He's doing a better job of waiting for pitches he can do more damage against, allowing him to tap into his power. He moves decently for a catcher but isn't a factor on the bases.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION landed two interesting center fielders when the 2015-16 international signing period opened on July 2. PERSON has blossomed into the system's best prospect since signing for $2.1 million out of the ORGANIZATION, while PERSON has emerged as one of its top defenders since turning pro for $500,000 out of Venezuela.PERSON's instincts stand out more than his pure tools, especially in center field. Though he's an average runner, he's at least a plus defender. He reads balls very well off the bat, gets good jumps with a quick first step and takes precise routes to the ball. His fringy arm fits fine in center.PERSON also shows advanced feel for making contact and running the bases. He uses a compact left-handed swing to lace line drives to all fields. He won't be a slugger but has enough pop to produce double-digit home run totals once he matures physically.",-1
"ORGANIZATION's No. 17 prospect for the 2017-18 international period, PERSON earned rave reviews for his bat as an amateur in the GPE Republic -- so much so that some scouts viewed him as the best overall hitter in his class. The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON in GPE, securing his future with a $750,000 bonus. He lived up to this reputation in his professional debut, finishing in the GPE with a taste of the ORGANIZATION after he had raked in GPE Summer League. PERSON's impressive pro debut underscored his potential at the plate. PERSON beyond his years, he has plus bat speed and impacts the ball using a quick, compact swing in which he generates huge extension through contact, driving the ball with back-spin carry. He has innate feel for finding the barrel, too, though his approach can be too pull-oriented, and he'll struggle with spin at times. The consistent gap power he showed in 2018, on top of his aforementioned swing mechanics, gives scouts the impression that PERSON could be good for 20-plus homers annually in his prime. Questions pertaining to PERSON's ability to stick at shortstop long-term will continue to follow him as he moves through the Minors, but he handled the position well during in pro debut, albeit while relying on his sheer athleticism and above-average arm strength. But as a physically advanced teenager with below-average speed and only modest defensive actions, PERSON likely will end up at the hot corner. The good news is that his bat could profile nicely there, provided PERSON's development plays out as expected and he makes the necessary adjustments along the way.",-1
"PERSON opened eyes with his bat as a GPE amateur, and many scouts viewed him arguably as the best overall hitter in the class. That distinction made him one of the most coveted players on the market, and he ranked as ORGANIZATION's No. 17 prospect for the 2017-18 international period before signing with ORGANIZATION for $750,000.PERSON is a bat-first prospect who has the makings of becoming a special offensive talent. PERSON like PERSON's approach and his swing. He's a mature player with quick hands, a plan at the plate and he can hit the ball hard to all fields. He's also been praised for his makeup and how he plays the game.PERSON was signed as a shortstop, but he's widely expected to end up at third base once he's added strength his naturally thicker frame. Second base is also a possibility, as is a corner-outfield spot, although neither his athleticism nor his below-average speed are clean fits at those positions.",-1

PERSON waited nearly two years before signing with the ORGANIZATION, receiving $300,000 in September 2017. He batted .400/.464/.592 between two Rookie levels in his 2018 pro debut but dropped to .213/.307/.253 following a promotion to low Class A.PERSON stands out most for his bat-to-ball skills, which were advanced enough to land him on GPE's 18-and-under team when he was just 15 years old. He understands his right-handed swing very well, controls the strike zone and likes to use the opposite field. He has some raw power but has yet to tap into it, prioritizing contact with an inside-out stroke and rarely pulling the ball with authority. Most of PERSON' value is going to come from his bat, so he'll need to hit more home runs in order to become a big league regular. His solid arm works at third base but he lacks quickness and range. To his credit, he improved his body last offseason and has shown more speed and defensive ability at the hot corner this year.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION spent $34 million on bonuses and tax penalties for their 2014-15 signings, and PERSON looks like the biggest bargain in the crop. Signed for $30,000 out of GPE, he has outperformed almost all of the prospects who landed bigger bonuses. He's one of the more polished young arms in the system and his stuff has ticked up since he came back from PERSON surgery that cost him the entire 2017 season.PERSON got stronger during the grueling rehab process after having his elbow reconstructed, and he now operates at 92-95 mph with his fastball. His best pitch is a solid to plus changeup that keeps left-handers honest and he has added a cutter this year that has similar potential. He also has feel for spinning a curveball that should be at least an average offering.While PERSON isn't overpowering, he has a long history of throwing strikes and commands his pitches well. He pounds the bottom of the strike zone and generates a lot of soft contact. He's on the path to becoming a back-of-the-rotation starter.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION handed out three seven-figure bonuses on the international market in 2014, paying GPE outfielder PERSON $1.5 million, and giving two Venezuelans -- right-hander PERSON and PERSON -- $1 million each.

Though he's just an average runner, PERSON has the quickness and other attributes to remain at shortstop. His instincts help give him good range, and he also has soft hands and solid arm strength.

He won't ever be a home run threat, but he could have some gap power once he adds some needed strength.",-1
"Signed for $1 million out of GPE, GPE was one of the most fundamentally sound shortstops in the 2014 international class. After he performed well in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION to start his pro career last summer, PERSON brought him to the GPE for the final month of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League season at age 17.GPE opened eyes when he homered eight times in 14 games in the Rookie-level GPE League this summer after he slugged .213 in the ORGANIZATION. He has started to physically mature and is noticeably stronger than he was in his debut. He needs to improve his pitch recognition but already shows the willingness to use the entire field.Less dynamic but more polished than fellow PERSON teenage shortstop prospect PERSON (acquired from the Phillies in the ORGANIZATION trade), GPE has solid range thanks to his fine instincts and quick first step. He also has soft hands and an accurate arm, and he could blossom into a true plus defender.",-1
"One of the most fundamentally sound shortstops available during the 2014-15 international signing period, GPE landed a $1 million bonus out of GPE. He made his GPE debut midway through his first pro season, then homered eight times in the first two weeks of the Rookie-level Appalachian League schedule last summer. He got too power-conscious afterward and tailed off, particularly after making the jump to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League, where he was the circuit's youngest regular at age 18.GPE has started to mature physically and has gotten significantly stronger since turning pro, though he projects more as a 15-homer guy than the slugger he looked like last summer. That's still plenty of power for a legitimate shortstop, and he needs to realize he's at his best when he focuses on hitting line drives to all fields. He'll always be an aggressive hitter but will need to make more contact at higher levels.Though he has just average speed, GPE covers more than enough ground at shortstop because he has keen instincts and a quick first step. A reliable defender with soft hands and an accurate arm, he also has seen action at second base. A utility role could be a fallback, but he has the tools to profile as an everyday player.",-1
"PERSON looked up to PERSON growing up in the greater GSP area.

Some are plus right now, including an arm that delivers 90-plus-mph throws from the outfield (and helped him throw in the low-90s from the mound). He also has plus speed to go along with outstanding instincts that made him one of the best defensive outfielders in the class and will allow him to stick in center. His wheels make him a threat on the basepaths and there's offensive potential to tap into as well. He has raw pop from the left side of the plate he'll continue to grow into, though he'll need to continue refining his approach to tap into it consistently.The outfielder gets very high marks for his makeup and work ethic, which should help him maximize his tools. The ORGANIZATION thought he could handle a challenge, skipping him over the rookie-level ORGANIZATION and sending him to the GPE League to begin his pro career.",-1
"As the start of the 2018-19 international signing period drew near, GPE was No. 3 on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 international prospects list. The ORGANIZATION wasted no time to pounce, inking the talented outfielder for $2.75 million. He'll make his professional debut this season.GPE has the chance to be a dynamic up-the-middle player who hits at or near the top of a lineup. He's shown an ability to make consistent line-drive contact, performing well against older competition in the ORGANIZATION Winter League's parallel program for young players over the years. He has plus speed, he's been clocked with premium 60-yard times, that should help him on both sides of the ball. He's already considered an advanced defender who can stay in center field long-term and he continues to make strides with his throwing, with evaluators feeling he'll have an average arm in the future.It will be years before the ORGANIZATION get a return on their investment with GPE. But the combination of his instincts, makeup and tools will make it exciting to watch him begin the climb up the ORGANIZATION ladder in 2019.",-1

He lived up to his reputation during his pro debut in the Rookie-level PERSON League.PERSON has more athleticism than most catchers, and it's obvious in all phases of his defensive game. He's a quality receiver who moves quickly to block balls in the dirt, and his footwork enhances his plus arm. Because he grew up around the game, he's a more advanced game-caller than most teenagers. PERSON creates solid raw power with the bat speed and loft in his left-handed swing. His stroke can get too long and uphill, however, leading to a 30 percent strikeout rate in his first taste of pro ball and questions about how consistently he'll produce at the plate. He has close to average speed now, but figures to slow down as he gets bigger and endures the rigors of catching.",-1
"The son of college coach PERSON, PERSON moved from the ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, Ala.) to the ORGANIZATION (Miami) for his senior year after his dad changed jobs from PERSON to ORGANIZATION.

He gets the most out of his plus arm thanks to his fast footwork and release, and he's also a quality receiver who moves well behind the plate. His leadership and game-calling skills are also more advanced than most high school backstops.PERSON' power stands out more than his hitting ability at this point, though he has the potential to contribute in both areas.

"PERSON headed into the 2017 PERSON ranked as the ORGANIZATION. 72 prospect by ORGANIZATION. In a class that lacked catching prospects, PERSON stood out, and the ORGANIZATION took him ORGANIZATION. 52 overall and gave him a bonus north of $2 million, well above pick value, to sign him away from playing for his father, GPE, the coach at ORGANIZATION. If his first full season of pro ball is any indication, it will be money well spent, as PERSON finished third in the system in ORGANIZATION and fourth in homers, all while learning the nuances of catching.The left-handed-hitting backstop has some serious raw power to tap into, with bat speed and loft that will allow him to continue to show over-the-fence pop. There is too much swing and miss to PERSON's game, with a strikeout rate of more than 30 percent heading into 2019, and he'll have to continue to refine his approach at the plate to keep reaching his power as he advances. PERSON is very athletic, running better than most catchers, and uses that agility behind the plate. He is an excellent blocker and already shows an ability to work with pitchers to call a good game. His plus arm allowed him to throw out nearly 42 percent of potential base stealers in 2018.Developing high school catching is often a crapshoot, but PERSON, thanks to his all-around skills and having grown up around the game, has a chance to buck the trend, though he'll have to erase a rough 2019 season.

He continued to boost his stock during the offseason in the ORGANIZATION Winter League, garnering PERSON of the Year honors after he delivered six homers and 26 ORGANIZATION over 35 games. PERSON is physically put together and looks the part of a future big leaguer. His strength really shows when he swings the bat, as he'll generate huge raw power from the right side of the plate that often translates to tape-measure home runs during games. PERSON's power does come with a heavy dose of swing-and-miss, which in turn raises concerns about his hitting ability, but scouts who saw him last season were impressed by his feel for the barrel and believe he'll make more contact as his pitch recognition improves. He's an average runner, perhaps a tick above, and moves well underway, though he's likely to lose a step or two as he continues to add strength. PERSON fits better in left field than right because his arm strength is only slightly above average. Evaluators believe he'll be an average defensive corner outfielder once he improves his reads and routes, though it's widely agreed that it will be PERSON's bat that dictates his development. If it all clicks, PERSON could be hitting 25-plus homers from the middle of the ORGANIZATION' lineup in a matter of years.",-1

While GPE slid to the Twins in the fifth round after slumping as an GPE junior, PERSON lived up to expectations and signed for a well over-slot $2.2 million as a Marlins second-rounder. Some scouts considered him the best defensive shortstop available.PERSON is a quick-twitch athlete with all the ingredients necessary to win ORGANIZATION. He has smooth actions, quick hands and feet plus the arm strength to make any throw from any angle. If he can't provide enough offense to become an everyday player in the Majors, he will have the tools to play anywhere on the diamond in a utility role.Because PERSON lacks physicality at 5-foot-9 and 160 pounds, there are some concerns as to how much impact he can have at the plate. A contact-oriented switch-hitter whose swing is better from the right side, he offers little in the way of power. He knows how to use his well above-average speed on the bases and he understands his role is to get on base.",-1

After turning pro for an over-slot $400,000 in the fifth round, he nearly led the Rookie-level PERSON in homers (eight in 32 games) despite signing late and fighting hamstring issues.PERSON has the best raw power and one of the quickest bats among GPE prospects. He could deliver 30 or more homers annually from the right side of the plate, provided he makes enough contact. He's very raw at the plate with an aggressive, pull-heavy approach and struck out in 31 percent of his ORGANIZATION plate appearances.While his power is his most obvious tool, PERSON is far from a one-dimensional masher.

His lack of offensive production has added to the worries about his profile, though he did show improvement in the second half of his first full year.PERSON certainly did struggle in the first half of 2018, hitting just .198 with a. .513 OPS in the ORGANIZATION before the All-Star break. Some of that is because of the aforementioned lack of strength, though the A's think he can add some to help him stay durable, but much of it can be attributed to PERSON having to deal with the loss of a family member in early May. In the second half, PERSON corrected a little drift in his swing and started impacting the baseball more, posting a .274 average and .679 OPS after the break. His walk rate went up and his strikeout rate dropped as his pitch recognition improved. He also stopped worrying about trying to lift or drive the ball, understanding that consistent contact and on-base skills, combined with his plus speed, are his ticket. There's never been any question that PERSON's glove will carry him to the big leagues.

The one thing no one questions is PERSON's ability to stick at shortstop. He is a plus defender with outstanding range and more than enough arm to make throws from all over the diamond, making highlight reel plays with regularity, even on big stages like the ORGANIZATION Game All-American Classic. While PERSON will never hit for power, he has added some strength in his lower half and should be able to continue to do so as he matures, allowing him to shoot the ball to the gaps.

On the other side of the ball, the jury is still out regarding PERSON's upside with the bat. While he shows good feel to hit and bat-to-ball skills, PERSON desperately needs to add strength to his undersized frame in order to consistently impact the baseball.

The Pacific-12 Conference player of the year as a sophomore in 2017, PERSON might have won the award again is he hadn't lost half of the 2018 season to a broken left wrist. He had to settle for helping the ORGANIZATION win the ORGANIZATION World Series before signing for a $6,411,400 bonus. The best pure hitter in the 2018 GPE, PERSON barrels the ball and controls the strike zone with ease. A right-handed hitter with a line-drive swing, he doesn't have a lot of home run power but can sting the ball into the gaps. He's at least a plus runner with excellent instincts on the bases, and his offensive package fits nicely at the top of a batting order.PERSON played second base at FACILITY in deference to shortstop PERSON, an Orioles supplemental first-rounder who was the top defender in the GPE. PERSON has the hands and actions for shortstop, and the FACILITY plan on trying him there, but he doesn't have typical arm strength for the position. He could get by a la PERSON at short or develop into a ORGANIZATION Glover at second base.",-1
" The younger brother of GPE reliever PERSON, PERSON began his college career at FACILITY, then transferred to PERSON and re-entered the GPE. A 40th-round pick out of high school, he improved his GPE standing by 33 rounds, with a solid pro debut in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League after the ORGANIZATION took him in the seventh round. He moved to full-season ball in 2018.PERSON has average tools across the board, with the chance to be better than that with the bat. He has an advanced approach from the left side of the plate, draws walks and shows the penchant for consistent line-drive contact. He may never be a big power guy, but there is some extra-base ability and he should run into a few homers along the way. Defensively, PERSON is steady, but many feel he won't stay at shortstop long-term, and he has seen some time at second base during his full-season debut in 2018. If it all comes together, he could be an offensive-minded second baseman, with the possibility of being a lefty-hitting-utility type also feasible.",-1
"If nothing else, the PERSON brothers know how to overachieve. Older brother PERSON was a 20th-round pick of the ORGANIZATION in 2015 and has spent the last two years pitching out of their big league bullpen. PERSON was a 40th-round pick out of high school in the same Draft as his brother and after a year at FACILITY, transferred to PERSON. A huge season there landed him in the seventh round of the 2017 Draft and he had a solid, albeit unspectacular, first full season in 2018 that included a GPE ORGANIZATION All-Star nod.PERSON has the chance to have four at least average tools. As a legitimate 6-foot-2 infielder, the easy thing to say is he won't be able to stay at shortstop long-term, but the PERSONlies haven't seen any reason why he can't, with his hands, arm, accuracy and footwork all working well from the premium position. He has a solid approach at the plate, with the ability to work counts, and while there isn't a ton of over-the-fence-power, he can drive the ball from the left side of the plate.If PERSON can continue to develop offensively and gets to be a Major League average hitter, he's at least a solid utility type in the big leagues, and he did play a few games at second in 2018. But there's enough upside here to think he could find a way to be a big league regular.",-1
"PERSON was generating some first-round Draft buzz last spring before a bout of elbow tendinitis caused him to struggle and miss time. He ended up falling to the second round, where he ORGANIZATION lured him away from a GPE commitment with $1.2 million bonus. After a promising pro debut in the Rookie-level PERSON, PERSON has built on that success this year in his full-season debut for Class A PERSON. PERSON can pitch to both sides of the plate with a low-90s fastball that peaks at 96, and he complements it with a sharp curveball that flashes above-average potential. The ORGANIZATION introduced a slider to his arsenal last season that could be an effective pitch in time, but right now it's in the nascent stages of development. PERSON also displays good feel for his changeup, which he throws with convincing arm speed and good fading action.While PERSON lacks ideal size as a 6-foot-1, 180-pound right-hander, his high three-quarters arm slot allows him create a good downhill angle to the plate, and he proved to be a ground-ball machine in his pro debut. He generates his velocity with athleticism and arm speed rather than effort and is consistently around the zone. Provided he stays healthy, PERSON has a chance to develop into a solid No. 4 starter in the ORGANIZATION.",-1

He won high Class A GPE League pitcher of the year honors in 2017 before coming to the ORGANIZATION that December in the ORGANIZATION trade along with right-hander PERSON and infielder PERSON. In his first season in his new organization, he was PERSON's ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year and topped the Double-A LOCATION in wins (12) and innings pitched (152 2/3).More mature and poised than a typical 22-year-old, PERSON is the most polished pitcher in the organization. He's not flashy but his 92-95 mph fastball plays up because it has late movement and he commands it well. His plus changeup is his best pitch and his curveball flashes above-average potential.In terms of pure stuff, PERSON profiles as a back-of-the-rotation starter. But his advanced command of his entire repertoire could make him a No. 3 starter. He was on course to make his big league debut in 2019 before surgery on the meniscus in his right knee sidelined him for three months early in the season.",-1

That was the ORGANIZATION' first pick and they gave PERSON a slightly higher than pick value bonus of $1.2 million to sign.When he was fully healthy, PERSON was pitching at 92-94 mph and peaking at 96 with his lively fastball. He has an advanced changeup for a high schooler, maintaining his arm speed and imparting some fade when he throws it. He did a better job of spinning his curveball, though some scouts wonder if he might be better off throwing a slider. PERSON lacks ideal size at 6-foot-1 and 185 pounds, though he generates his velocity with athleticism and arm speed rather than effort. That, plus his ability to stay around the strike zone, gives him every chance to remain a starter.",-1

The right-hander made big strides with his changeup in 2016, throwing it with better arm speed and generating more fading action, and scouts believe it will develop into a plus pitch. His curveball is currently ahead of his low-80s slider in terms of effectiveness and consistency, but he did show better feel for the latter last season. He's consistently around the zone and efficient with all of his pitches.PERSON's high three-quarters arm slot allows him to create a good downhill angle to the plate, and he generates his velocity with athleticism and arm speed rather than effort.

That progress caught the eye of the ORGANIZATION, who acquired him, PERSON and PERSON in December for speedster PERSON Gordon.PERSON may pitch with average velocity, topping out at 92-93 mph, but his fastball plays consistently above that grade due to its late movement.

After showing a polished approach as an amateur, he got overly aggressive and struck out in 29 percent of his plate appearances in his pro debut. He's most effective when he uses the whole field and doesn't try to do too much at the plate.Though he's a bottom-of-the-scale runner, GPE is a surprisingly effective defender at the hot corner.

PERSON's Ohio state player of the year, he had even more upside as a hitter, prompting the ORGANIZATION to pay him a $565,000 bonus in the 11th round. If not for signability concerns related to his ORGANIZATION commitment, he might have gone in the top three rounds.GPE creates impressive raw power with bat speed and loft in his right-handed swing, as well as with strength. More than just a slugger, he uses the entire field and lets his home runs come naturally, giving him solid hitting ability. He finished second in the home run derby at the ORGANIZATION All-American Classic last August and has a long track record of performing well against top competition on the showcase circuit.Though GPE has bottom-of-the-scale speed, he moves well enough to get the job done at third base.

He entered 2017 as a legitimate two-way prospect before it became apparent that his future was brighter as perhaps the best pure high school hitter available.

He showed an improved ability to tap into his considerable raw power during the spring, driving the ball to all fields with a quick, pretty stroke. He has barreled balls so easily for so long that when he slumped toward the end of his senior season, most scouts shook it off because of his track record.In addition to his hitting prowess, PERSON is also a gifted defender at first base.

One of a number of legitimate two-way prospects in the 2017 Draft, he drew interest as a pitcher until it became clear that he might be the best pure prep hitter available. He joined PERSON as the only first basemen ever taken in the first round by the GPE, signing for $3,450,000 as the 14th overall selection.While PERSON slumped at the end of his high school senior season and had a so-so pro debut, that hasn't stopped scouts from comparing him to PERSON and PERSON (the ORGANIZATION. 4 overall pick in 2017). Like them, PERSON is a hit-over-power first baseman who bats left-handed and has a mature approach at the plate, though he has struggled while trying to do too much in his first full season. He owns a pretty swing with plenty of bat speed, has an affinity for using the entire field and is beginning to tap into his considerable raw power.PERSON is a better athlete than most first basemen.

On the mound, he was very similar to ORGANIZATION at the same stage of their careers, displaying an upper-80s fastball, promising secondary pitches and advanced feel.",-1
"As a high schooler, PERSON was a two-way star who attended PERSON, a program that has produced big league hitters like PERSON and PERSON. He was also a teammate of 2017 second-round pick PERSON, now with the ORGANIZATION, and a frequent member of ORGANIZATION national teams winning gold medals. As a senior, his bat jumped ahead of his arm and the ORGANIZATION took him in the middle of the first round to hit and he did just that in his first full year, finishing with 14 homers and 22 steals.While PERSON struggled out of the gate in the LOCATION, he showed just why he was considered one of the best high school bats in the 2017 Draft class with a .322/.394/.518 line in the second half. He dug an even deeper first-half hole in 2019, hitting .167/.262/.230 in the ORGANIZATION before slowly finding himself in the second half. He has shown a solid overall approach at the plate and can drive the ball to all fields, but there's been more swing and miss to his game than some anticipated, though that did improve in his strong finish to the 2018 season. He started tapping into his left-handed power more, with the chance to grow into even more as he matures and refines his approach. While PERSON has fringy speed, he might be the most instinctive baserunner in the system, allowing him to be aggressive on the basepaths. His athleticism also plays well at first with excellent defensive tools, including a plus arm that used to fire upper-80s fastballs from the mound. He has every chance to follow in GPE's footsteps as a homegrown first-round pick who plays first base every day in GPE.",-1
"PERSON was a solid high school prospect from GPE who was drafted by the ORGANIZATION in the 11th round back in 2016, but opted to head to the ORGANIZATION of GPE. He's developed into an intriguing corner infielder with pop and led the Pac-12 Conference with 77 RBIs, fifth most among ORGANIZATION Division I hitters, while batting .342 with 15 home runs and a .626 slugging percentage. Offensively, PERSON's raw power is his carrying tool. It shows up in games in flashes and he has the ability to hit the ball with authority the other way, to right-center field, but he gets pull happy at times. That leads to some swing and miss and streakiness, but if he can stay with his strengths, he could be an average hitter and tap into that power more consistently. A shortstop in high school, PERSON moved over to the hot corner in college and has become a plus defender there. While the one knock against him is his pure foot speed, he has good first-step quickness at third, with confident hands, a plus arm when he needs it and the ability to make plays on the run.PERSON plays with a confidence that scouts like and there's no question he can stay at third long-term. Some small adjustments at the plate could turn him into a very intriguing run-producer at the infield corner spot.",-1
"PERSON recorded 20 saves in his first two seasons at LOCATION and dealt in the ORGANIZATION last summer, then shifted to the rotation this spring.

The high spin rates on his pitches made him even more attractive to analytically-minded clubs, and the Indians were happy to land the right-hander for below slot at $750,000 after selecting him in the second round. PERSON may be a 5-foot-11 right-hander without overpowering stuff, but he makes up for it by mixing five pitches and three arm angles. He'll throw a four-seam fastball and a curveball from a nearly overhand slot and a two-seamer and a slider as a sidearmer, and he'll also work in a changeup and a lower-three-quarters angle. It all adds up to about a dozen combinations of pitches and slots, and he can hit 94 mph with nasty life on his fastball from down low.PERSON will have to tighten his slider at the next level, because pro hitters won't chase it as much as collegians do. He has the makings of a solid changeup too, and his feel for altering speeds and eye levels while pounding the strike zone gives him the opportunity to continue to succeed as a starter at the next level. His size will lead to durability questions -- he left one April start early and missed the next with shoulder stiffness -- although the Indians have had plenty of success with similarly-built hurlers in previous Drafts.",-1

They considered calling him up to the big leagues in September until he wore down late in the summer.PERSON overcomes being a 5-foot-11 right-hander without overpowering stuff by confounding hitters with a mix of five pitches from three different arm slots. His best offering is a two-seam fastball with unusual velocity (up to 95 mph) with nasty life from a sidearm angle. He also throws a sweeping slider from down low, a changeup from a low-three-quarters slot and a four-seamer and a curveball from a high-three-quarters slot.PERSON has tremendous feel for pitching, pounding the zone with all of his combinations of pitches and deliveries. He has an uncanny ability to throw hitters off balance by changing speeds and eye levels, and he was more effective against left-handers than right-handers in his pro debut.

He has handled every challenge GPE has given him, including an ORGANIZATION assignment last offseason and a promotion to Double-A to start his first full season, slowed only by strained left elbow ligaments last summer and a hairline fracture of his left wrist after getting hit by a pitch this April.PERSON excels at putting the bat on the ball, thanks to his uncanny hand-eye coordination, compact right-handed swing and controlled approach.

He has the sneaky power to hit 15 homers per season, not to mention the patience to draw walks and the solid to plus speed to steal bases.Though he has the quickness and athleticism for shortstop, scouts are mixed on his ability to stay there. His instincts and reliability stand out more than his range or arm at shortstop, so he may be better suited for second base and has drawn comparisons to PERSON.

Signed for $2,724,000, he posted a 1.021 OPS in 14 games before his pro debut ended when he strained ligaments in his left elbow diving for a ball.With outstanding hand-eye coordination and a controlled approach, PERSON excels at making line-drive contact from the right side of the plate.

He looked much more like the ORGANIZATION version of himself during his pro debut, finishing in the top 10 in a host of categories and earning an All-Star nod in the rookie-level PERSON League.Primarily a shortstop in college, the ORGANIZATION immediately moved him to the outfield and liked what they saw there. He played most of the summer in right field, and has the arm for the spot, but he could have the speed and instincts to be a solid average defender in center field. That speed also helps him on the bases, and he broke out of the gate with 17 steals in his pro debut. Everything else went well for him during his debut, from managing the strike zone and drawing walks to toning down his overly aggressive approach in order to use all fields to hit for average and power. If you saw PERSON on the right day, you might put above-average grades on him across the board.The ORGANIZATION love PERSON's makeup and natural leadership ability.

He needed just six starts before earning a promotion to high Class A in mid-May.PERSON has been able to overmatch lower-level Minor Leaguers with his curveball, one of the best in GPE's system. Like most ORGANIZATION farmhands, he challenges hitters with four-seam fastballs up and curves down in the strike zone. He sits at 90-92 mph with his heater and employs a changeup with splitter action.PERSON has delivered strikes throughout his pro career. He can't blow the ball by hitters, so it remains to be seen how he'll fare against more advanced opponents who can do a better job of laying off his curveball.

On the Sunday morning before the ORGANIZATION his brother would play in, PERSON out-homered future PERSON first-rounder PERSON in the annual ORGANIZATION and got to take hacks in between rounds of the big league derby. In game action, he's shown an advanced feel to hit, giving him the chance to hit for average and power. His defensive game is a bit behind his bat, outside of his arm, which is a plus tool that helps control a running game. PERSON made strides in his defensive work during the spring, but he'll need to improve his overall receiving skills to show he can stick as a catcher. PERSON did play some third base during the ORGANIZATION Games and showed some agility there, and there's always the chance he could join his brother among the first base ranks. For now, however, the GPE will give PERSON every chance to stick behind the plate, where his bat offers the most upside.",-1

He'll flash a wipeout slider at times and significantly improved his curveball as a senior to the point where there's debate as to which has more potential. He also displays some feel for a changeup though he hasn't had to use it much.PERSON's high-three-quarters effort delivery doesn't contain much effort, though he did battle the strike zone on occasion in college.

The GPE teenager came to GPE in the fall to participate in the organization's high performance camp, rather than play in instructional league games, so he'll be making his professional debut in 2019.Two things stood out for the ORGANIZATION with PERSON from the get-go: his bat speed and his footspeed. He has work to do on his approach, nothing new given his age and experience level, but he's already been making an effort in that regard and will just have to start applying it as he begins his career in earnest. He should have the ability to hit for average and the leverage in his swing points to plenty of power as well. PERSON can really run too, with some seeing 80 run times on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. There are some good defensive tools to work with, though at first his actions weren't in sync, with his feet ahead of his hands. He's already shown more maturity in approaching ground balls and keeping his feet under him, giving more confidence he can stay on the dirt with his strong arm.Whether that's at shortstop remains to be seen, as it's hard to know exactly how his body will continue to mature. A move to third or second could be in his future, and the ORGANIZATION think his electric speed would play in center field.",-1

PERSON is a big power bat, and big power bats play. The teenager has shown tons of strength now, and it's expected to increase as he grows and makes his way through the ORGANIZATION' system. PERSON has good mechanics at the plate and creates a lot of backspin and loft at contact. One scout dropped a young PERSON comparison on him, while another evaluator believes PERSON could eventually hit .270 and hit 25-30 home runs in the big leagues.On defense, PERSON has shown good footwork, a good arm and solid defensive actions. He's been working out at shortstop and has a good feel for the position, but he could shift to third base one day. PERSON has good hands now that could eventually become a plus tool.",-1
"There may not be another player, prep or college, from the 2018 Draft class with more raw power than PERSON, the high school infielder from GPE. He showed it off at various home run derbies on last summer's showcase circuit, including the ORGANIZATION All-Star High PERSON in GPE, but it also shows up in games. While that has been inconsistent at times, the ORGANIZATION saw enough of it to take PERSON with the 19th overall pick for full pick value, just over $3.2 million.Some scouts give PERSON's raw power from the left side a 70-grade on the 20-to-80 scale. There are some holes in his swing, which will lead to some swing and miss, but those who have seen him when he's locked in have seen his ultra-quick hands and bat speed. PERSON did show that he can make hard contact against good competition at times over the summer, though he'd been a bit up and down this spring, partially because he was rarely pitched to. One concern was whether he could stick at third, and while he showed well at the hot corner at a variety of summer events, some of those worries did resurface this spring.The PERSON sent PERSON out to play the hot corner, sending him to the GPE League to begin his pro career, and he got off to a very good start. If he can continue to refine his approach enough to tap into that power consistently, he has the chance to perfectly fit the profile of a run-producing third baseman in the middle of a big league lineup.",-1
"As an ORGANIZATION high schooler, PERSON established himself as one of the top sluggers in the 2018 Draft class with booming power displays at home run derbies on the summer showcase circuit, including the ORGANIZATION All-Star High PERSON in GPE, as well as during games. The ORGANIZATION were thrilled to find him still available with the 19th overall pick and signed PERSON for full pick value, just over $3.2 million. He showcased his prodigious power by swatting 17 home runs in 63 games during an impressive pro debut that included a promotion to the Class A Midwest League.PERSON has light-tower power from the left side of the plate, with some scouts giving his raw power a 70-grade on the 20-to-80 scale. That power does come with some holes in his swing and leads to some swing-and-miss tendencies, but there's no denying that PERSON has ultra-quick hands and bat speed. He proved that he could make hard contact against good competition over the summer (when pitchers weren't avoiding him) and continued to do so during his pro debut, all while demonstrating a quality approach.Some evaluators wonder whether PERSON will remain a third baseman on account of his rigid actions and the likelihood of decreased mobility as he matures physically. He does have the arm strength for the position, however, and is praised for his instincts. If PERSON can continue to refine his approach enough to tap into that power consistently, he has the chance to perfectly fit the profile of a run-producing third baseman in the middle of a big league lineup.",-1
"PERSON viewed PERSON as one of the better prep hitters in the 2016 Draft after he hit .636 in 19 games as a senior at ORGANIZATION Prep (ORGANIZATION, Pa.). Though a first-round talent, concerns about PERSON' signability caused him to fall into the second round, where the GPE picked him 55th overall and then lured him away from his GPE commitment with a $2,250,000 bonus, nearly twice the value for his slot.PERSON' bat speed and fluid left-handed swing allow him to make hard contact with ease, and he exhibits advanced plate discipline with an approach that belies his age. His raw power is impressive and should only improve as he adds strength to his projectable frame, and scouts peg him for at least average power in games at maturity. An average runner who played shortstop in high school, PERSON was shifted to third base upon signing. His size and physicality are clean fits at the position, as are his hands, actions and above-average arm strength. He has the makings of an average defender, but it will be PERSON' bat and overall offensive ceiling that get him to the big leagues.",-1
"One of the premier prep hitters in the 2016 Draft, PERSON likely would have been a first-round pick if not for signability concerns that ultimately led to his selection by the Indians in the second round. After signing for nearly twice slot value, PERSON made his pro debut in the Rookie-level PERSON before advancing to the Class A Short-Season New York-Penn League in 2017, leading the circuit in on-base percentage (.430) and ORGANIZATION (.912) while also pacing all Indians farmhands with a .317 average.A left-handed hitter, PERSON combines bat speed with a fluid stroke and natural feel for the barrel to generate hard contact across the field. He knows how to get on base, too, showing advanced plate discipline and an age-defying approach that helped him lead the NY-PL in both walks (43) and ORGANIZATION as a teenager. And while PERSON' impressive raw power has yet to translate during games, scouts do expect him to develop above-average power as he adds strength to his athletic and highly projectable frame and trims some of the swing-and-miss from his game.The Indians moved PERSON off shortstop, his position as a prep, to third base upon his entering the pro ranks. His size and physicality are clean fits at the hot corner, as are his plus arm strength and average speed, though some evaluators believe his inconsistent glove work will eventually land him in right field. Regardless of his future defensive home, PERSON has the bat and offensive ceiling needed to become an impactful everyday player at the highest level.",-1
"The state of GPE was home to two of the better prep hitters in the 2016 Draft in PERSON and PERSON. While the ORGANIZATION took PERSON with the 15th overall pick, PERSON, who scouts widely considered to be a first-round talent, remained on the board until the second round due to signability concerns. Undeterred, the GPE selected him 55th overall and then lured him away from what was believed to be a strong commitment to GPE with a $2,250,000 bonus, nearly twice the value for his slot. PERSON' senior year started slow as he tweaked his back and missed the beginning of the season, but he made up for the lost time by hitting .636 in 19 games. PERSON has good bat speed and excellent raw power from the left side. An average runner who might have slowed down a tick as he's added weight to his lanky frame, PERSON has good hands and actions for the infield. Despite playing shortstop in high school, PERSON size and physicality profile better at third base moving forward, though some believe he could offensive-minded second baseman or perhaps a left fielder. Regardless of where PERSON lands on the defensive spectrum, it will be his bat and offensive ceiling that get him to the big leagues.",-1
"PERSON took to hockey before baseball and showed promise as a center before concussion issues caused him to focus on the diamond. One of the better high school hitters in the 2016 Draft, he dropped to the second round amid signability concerns but landed first-round bonus money ($2.25 million). After a so-so pro debut, he led the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League with a .912 OPS in 2017, ranked third in the Class A ORGANIZATION with an .858 mark last year and posted a .910 OPS during the final month in Class A Advanced.PERSON has an advanced approach at the plate, patiently working counts and using the entire field. He has a smooth left-handed swing and impressive feel to hit, and he shows the ability to produce high batting averages despite working deep counts that lead to some strikeouts. His bat speed and strength give him promising power potential that could produce 25 or more homers per season, especially if he adds some loft to a stroke that's currently more geared for line drives.Though he's a below-average runner, PERSON is a decent athlete and has worked hard to make the transition from amateur shortstop to pro third baseman. He has a strong arm and has improved his footwork, but still needs to increase his range in order to become an average defender at the hot corner. If he can't, his alternatives would be first base or an outfield corner.",-1
"PERSON didn't concentrate on pitching until his junior year of high school, then started attracting scouts when he starred on the showcase circuit that summer. The ORGANIZATION took him in the third round of the 2016 Draft on his graduation day, signing him for an above-slot $1.15 million. He totaled just 20 2/3 innings in his first two years as a pro because he's not developed physically and had some minor shoulder issues in 2017.New York puts a lot of emphasis on spin rates, and PERSON had the highest (2,685 rpm) on his fastball at the 2015 World Wood Bat Association World Championship. He sat at 89-92 mph as an amateur and is working there again after his layoff, though he should gain velocity as he adds strength and has flashed a mid-90s heater during offseason workouts. His spin gives his fastball deceptive riding life that keeps it off barrels.PERSON also has a feel for spinning a curveball, but his changeup requires a lot of work because he didn't use it much in high school. A quality athlete, he repeats his clean delivery well and shouldn't have any issues throwing strikes. Though he barely has gotten started in pro ball, he's still young and has the upside of a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"PERSON didn't pitch much before his junior season of high school, but he then emerged as a prospect on the showcase circuit the following summer. After he followed up with a strong senior year, GPE drafted him in the third round on the same day he graduated. Because he was young for the GPE (age 17) and still developing physically, the ORGANIZATION limited him to seven innings in his debut after signing him for an above-slot $1.15 million.Though he's not very physical, PERSON currently pitches with an 89-92 mph fastball than can reach 95. His heater had the best spin rate (2685 rpm) at the 2015 World Wood Bat Association World Championship, giving it riding life that makes it tough for hitters to barrel. The former two-way prep player should add more velocity as he focuses on pitching and continues to mature physically.PERSON also shows good feel for spinning a curveball, but he'll need to work on his changeup after not needing it much as an amateur. His quality athleticism helps him repeat his clean delivery, which bodes well for his ability to refine his control and command. He pitched sparingly in 2017 because of minor shoulder issues and will need time to develop, but youth and aptitude are on his side, and he has the upside of a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"PERSON GPE (Calif.) PERSON has spawned four big league position players, most notably PERSON, but has yet to produce a pitcher. PERSON, who would have been a two-way player had he attended PERSON, hopes to break through on the mound after signing for $1.15 million as a third-round pick in June.Though he's not extremely physical, PERSON has an 89-92 mph fastball that can reach 95. His heater had the highest recorded spin rate (2685 rpm) at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in 2015, which results in riding life that makes it tougher to hit. He also has some power to his curveball, which sits in the upper 70s, and will need to work on his changeup after using it sparingly in high school.One of the younger players in the 2016 Draft, PERSON didn't turn 18 until three weeks afterward. His youth, athleticism and aptitude bode well for his future development. He'll need to add strength but he has a clean delivery and shouldn't have any difficulties finding the strike zone.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION selected not one but two GPE high school right-handers in the first round of the 2015 Draft. After selecting PERSON at ORGANIZATION. 21, they grabbed PERSON at ORGANIZATION. 33 and signed him for $1,825,200. While PERSON had established himself as a premier talent on the showcase circuit the previous summer, PERSON didn't raise his stock to that level until his senior season. The reports on PERSON coming into 2015 were that he was athletic and projectable but possessed mostly average stuff. He opened eyes by working with a 92-95 mph fastball and a solid slider in his first start of the year and maintained them through much of the spring. He also has feel for a curveball and changeup.PERSON has an easy delivery and repeats it well, allowing him to throw strikes on a consistent basis. He doesn't have PERSON's pure stuff but he has a deeper repertoire and perhaps a bit more polish.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION spent both of their 2015 first-round picks on right-handers from GPE high schools, taking PERSON at ORGANIZATION. 21 and PERSON at ORGANIZATION. 33. While ORGANIZATION entered the year as one of the top prep pitching prospects, PERSON was viewed as a projectable athlete with present average stuff who might be better off attending PERSON. That outlook changed when his stuff surged last spring, earning him a $1,825,200 bonus.PERSON surprised scouts by working with a 92-95 mph fastball and a solid slider in his first high school start of the year, and he maintained them throughout most of the spring and his pro debut. His fastball hasn't been as sharp in his first full season, however, and PERSON has taken away his slider for now to have him focus on his curveball and changeup. The results haven't been pretty, as low Class A hitters have pounded him.Of the four prep arms PERSON has taken in the top two rounds of the 2014-15 GPE (ORGANIZATION, PERSON, PERSON), PERSON was considered the best prepared to enter pro ball. To his credit, he has continued to challenge hitters and throw strikes. He has a low-stress delivery and repeats it easily, allowing him to fill the zone.",-1
"Initially a prospect for the 2017 Draft, PERSON reclassified for the 2016 Draft a year ago. PERSON' best high school position prospect since PERSON went in the first round in 2011, PERSON went in the third round, getting a bonus close to $300,000 above pick value.A homeschooled student who took a class and played at ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, Kan.), PERSON offers an exciting array of tools. He has well above-average bat speed and foot speed and plus raw power and arm strength. He has committed to switch-hitting and while his natural right-handed stroke is quicker and more fluid, his lefty swing is fast and loose. Bigger than the typical shortstop and lacking the normal actions for the premium position, he did begin his pro career there. But he'll likely need to find a new defensive home long-term, and he does have the quickness for second and the arm for third. Some feel he's destined to play center field. The good news is his bat could profile at any of those spots, and he gets high marks for his work ethic, giving hope he'll get the most out of his plentiful tools.",-1
"In another effort to add athletic players who can play up the middle -- see the reports on PERSON and PERSON -- the ORGANIZATION selected PERSON, a homeschooled student who took a class and played high school ball at ORGANIZATION in GPE, in the third round of the 2016 Draft, one round after PERSON. They thought enough of his tools to give him a bonus nearly $300,00 above pick value to sign him away from LSU.PERSON struggled a bit during his first taste of pro ball, but his raw tools and outstanding athleticism were on display and the ORGANIZATION know they will have to be patient in helping him develop them. Relatively new to switch-hitting, he's better from the right side, though the left-handed swing is coming, and he could grow into future plus raw power. While he began his pro career at shortstop, he might not end up there. While he has the athleticism and arm for the position, there is a lot he'll need to learn in terms of footwork, positioning and throwing from all angles. PERSON field could be a good spot for his speed.For now, PERSON will try to get his professional feet under him. The ORGANIZATION plan to have him move around the diamond a little bit to see what might be the best fit and will let how those tools sharpen dictate how quickly he can move.",-1
"A home-schooled high school student who played for PERSON's team in GPE, PERSON was another raw and toolsy prep player taken by the ORGANIZATION. He went in the third round of the 2016 GPE, receiving almost $300,000 above pick value to walk away from his ORGANIZATION commitment, and has struggled to translate his tools into performance in two summers in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION League.A switch-hitter prior to the GPE, the ORGANIZATION have moved PERSON back to hitting right-handed only. That may have added to his learning curve as he had to re-learn how to recognize breaking balls from a right-handed pitcher as a professional, though the ORGANIZATION did see improved pitch recognition as the summer wore on. PERSON has added strength since signing and his raw power as ticked up as a result. He has plenty of bat speed, so it will come down to his approach at the plate in order for him to hit enough to tap into that power. As PERSON continues to physically mature, he's slowed down some and he might just be a tick above-average when all is said and done.While he has the arm for shortstop, that reduced foot speed and lack of instincts meant a move was inevitable, as did the signing of middle infielders like PERSON and PERSON. PERSON spent the 2018 season playing the outfield in the ORGANIZATION, seeing more time in center field than anywhere else.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $325,000 back in September 2013 after he had impressed club officials during an event in his native ORGANIZATION. He showed promise during his stateside debut in the ORGANIZATION and continued to make progress last year in his full-season debut, only to regress this season as a member of Class A Advanced PERSON's starting rotation.PERSON can run his fastball up to 98 mph and typically sits in the low 90s, though his velocity did fluctuate at times in 2016. His changeup is his best secondary pitch and receives solid-average grades from evaluators, who note that the right-hander throws the pitch with confidence. PERSON's breaking ball and control are both well below average and will be focal points in his development in 2017. The ORGANIZATION have helped PERSON simplify his delivery in the past year, but scouts still question whether his wiry frame will be able to handle the rigors of a full regular-season workload. If he's unable to stick in the rotation, PERSON's power arm and changeup could make him an effective late-inning reliever.",-1
"GPE didn't need to see PERSON pitch much before deciding to sign him to one of the biggest bonuses the club has ever given to a GPE amateur. Some clubs thought he wasn't eligible to sign until 2014, but the ORGANIZATION knew differently and were able to add another premium arm to their system.PERSON's fastball peaks at 95 mph, and scouts believe he'll throw even harder as he physically matures. He shows good feel for both a curveball and a slider, and he is working to develop his changeup as well.PERSON earns some physical comparisons to Taijuan PERSON. PERSON is a long way from that lofty ceiling, but his raw stuff and projectability already have the O's excited about his future.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $325,000 back in September 2013 after getting a brief look at the right-hander during an event in his native ORGANIZATION. He made his stateside debut last year at age 18 in the ORGANIZATION, and offered a glimpse at his potential with seven strikeouts over three hitless innings in his second start. He's continued to pile up strikeouts this year in his full-season debut for Class A Delmarva, all the while proving to be difficult to barrel for opposing hitters.PERSON had the ability to throw his fastball in the mid-90s in 2015 and was up to 98 mph in the fall during instructional league. The 6-foot-5 right-hander is still much more thrower than pitcher, though he made progress with his secondary stuff, a hard slider and raw changeup. PERSON's long limbs and lanky frame lead to problems repeating his delivery, though the ORGANIZATION helped him make a few tweaks during instructs, and he threw more strikes as a result.That PERSON celebrated his 19th birthday at the outset of the 2016 season means that there will be plenty of time for him to evolve as a pitcher. He might be a project, but all of the raw tools are there for him to develop into a big league hurler. He has a long way to go, but there's a lot to like in his combination of size, projectability and arm strength.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION' unprecedented 2015 international spending spree continued in November when they signed GPE defectors PERSON and PERSON for a combined $21.5 million and incurred a matching amount as a tax penalty for exceeding their bonus pool. PERSON, the younger and lesser known of the pair, received a $6 million bonus.PERSON made his debut in GPE's top league, the ORGANIZATION, as a 16-year-old in 2014-15. Though he batted just .213/.264/.313, he was able to make consistent contact, a testament to his hitting ability. His approach and pitch-recognition skills are advanced, and he also flashes some raw power in batting practice.PERSON's other tools and athleticism don't particularly stand out. He has fringy speed and arm strength, but his infield actions and instincts allow him to get the job done at second base.",-1
"Largely on the strength of what they considered an advanced bat, the ORGANIZATION gave PERSON a $6 million bonus and paid a matching amount as a penalty for exceeding their international bonus pool in November 2015. They promoted him aggressively, starting the GPE defector in low Class A at age 18 and promoting him to high Class A at 19, and he showed little consistency at the plate for most of his first three pro seasons. He seemed to turn a corner when he batted .340/.418/.547 in the final six weeks of 2018, finishing the year as the high Class A GPE League leader in runs (87) and doubles (43).PERSON has an unorthodox batting style in which his lower half tends to leak out while his shoulders remain square to the ball. During his late-season tear, he was more patient and hammered balls from gap to gap instead of trying to pull everything to left field. With his efficient right-handed stroke and advanced pitch-recognition skills, he could become a .275 hitter with 15 or more homers per year if he can maintain a disciplined approach.PERSON's quick hands and internal clock have helped him survive at shortstop, his primary position in two years in high Class A, but it will be a stretch for him to play there regularly in the Majors. His speed and arm are fringy and better suited for second base, where he can be an average defender. His lack of arm strength restricts his utility value, putting pressure on him to hit enough to become a regular.",-1
"PERSON made his debut in GPE's top league as a 16-year-old, batting .213/.264/.313 as a part-time player in 2014-15. After he defected and PERSON expedited his free agency, the ORGANIZATION signed him in November for a $6 million bonus and a matching amount as a tax penalty for exceeding their international pool. He began his pro career as the low Class A ORGANIZATION's youngest regular at age 18, and he heated up in the second half after a slow start.The ORGANIZATION love PERSON's instincts at the plate. He has tremendous feel for the barrel and an advanced ability to recognize pitches and use the entire field. He flashes some raw power in batting practice and has the aptitude to translate it into game results.PERSON got rich because of his bat, not because of his athleticism or other tools. He has fringy speed and arm strength, though he has a good internal clock that helps him get the job done at second base and has led GPE to give him some time at shortstop during his pro debut. If he can't stay in the middle infield, third base or left field would be his fallback possibilities.",-1
"PERSON's reputation for having an advanced bat allowed him to debut in GPE's top league as a 16-year-old and earned him a $6 million dollar bonus in November 2015 from the ORGANIZATION, who had to pay a matching penalty for exceeding their international bonus pool. PERSON has given him a series of aggressive assignments, and he initially responded by hitting .293/.340/.458 in the second half of his 2016 pro debut as the low Class A ORGANIZATION's youngest regular (age 18). He has yet to get his bat going during the last two seasons in high Class A, however.The ORGANIZATION like PERSON's right-handed swing and feel for the barrel, so they're surprised that he hasn't been more productive. His biggest problem is that he has an aggressive approach and doesn't recognize pitches well, flaws that older pitchers have been able to exploit. One positive is that he's doing a better job of tapping into his raw power in 2018, showing the ability to produce 15 homers per season.Though PERSON spent more of 2017 at shortstop and has split this year between second base and short, his subpar arm is stretched on the left side of the infield. That limits his value as a utilityman and puts more pressure on his bat, because he'll have to make it as an offensive second baseman. He overcomes fringy speed and quickness with a good internal clock on defense, allowing him to make plays.",-1
"PERSON has such an advanced bat that he debuted in GPE's top league as a 16-year-old. After he defected and PERSON expedited his free agency, the ORGANIZATION signed him in November 2015 for a $6 million bonus and a matching penalty for exceeding their international allotment. Challenged with an assignment to low Class A at age 18 in his pro debut, he hit .293/.340/.458 in the second half of 2016 as the ORGANIZATION's youngest regular but has yet to enjoy similar success in high class A this year.PERSON has one of the best right-handed swings among ORGANIZATION farmhands and precocious feel for the barrel. He's still honing his pitch recognition and can get overly aggressive at times, shortcomings that much older pitchers have exploited in 2017. He has some raw power and the ability to translate it into production, which eventually could mean 12-15 homers per season.An offensive second baseman in the mold of PERSON, PERSON has fringy speed and arm strength. He has a good internal clock on the field and has shown the ORGANIZATION a little more defensive ability than they expected. He has seen much more action at shortstop than at second base this year, but he's not suited for the left side of the infield and doesn't fit a utility profile.",-1
"Every once in a while a prospect comes along to defies traditional evaluations, who can't really fit into a specific box. PERSON, signed by the ORGANIZATION in 2015 and traded to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION deal in July 2017, could very well be that kind of player, especially following his strong first full season with his new organization in 2018.Tall and gangly, PERSON has grown since first entering pro ball and now stands at 6-foot-6, not a height anyone has seen stick at shortstop. And while there's still a good chance he doesn't, he's made more strides at the premium position than anyone anticipated, with a cannon for an arm and above-average speed that helps him range-wise. Super-athletic, PERSON could easily handle an outfield spot should he slow down as he physically matures, and he could easily be an above-average defender in a corner. His real upside, though, comes with the bat. He has as much raw power as anyone in the system and, thanks to some excellent adjustments, he started tapping into it more consistently as a teenager in the LOCATION, hitting 14 home runs.There's still more refinement in terms of strike zone discipline PERSON can make, but he's shown he is more than capable of developing that part of his game. Just 20 for all of the 2019 season, PERSON has tremendous upside and should continue to be one of the most fascinating prospects to track.",-1
"In the world of scouting and player development, who you sign isn't always who you get. PERSON was 6-foot-1 when he was first being scouted, then was 6-foot-4 by the time the ORGANIZATION signed him in 2015. By 2016, when he began his pro career, he had grown to 6-foot-6. His tremendous ceiling was on display with a move from the ORGANIZATION up to full-season ball in 2017 and the ORGANIZATION noticed, acquiring the gangly infielder in the ORGANIZATION deal last July. A return to low A has been beneficial for PERSON, who made a very nice step forward in 2018.Most of PERSON's upside comes in his power. He's more power over hit right now, and the ball jumps off of his bat. He has leverage and twitch at the plate, with plus game power starting to show up more frequently as he gets stronger and learns to control his body. His swing isn't overly long, but it does get out of control from time to time. Zone discipline has been a big area of focus and a more refined approach has allowed him to be a much more complete hitter in 2018. PERSON was a shortstop who moved over to third primarily in 2017, though some feel he has a chance to defy expectations and play up the middle. PERSON runs well and has a very strong arm, so a corner outfield spot might be his eventual home.Still very young for his level, PERSON is continuing to learn his body. Regardless of where he plays defensively, it's his bat that will allow him to move up the ladder, and there were definite signs of progress in 2018.",-1

Part of the ORGANIZATION' extravagant international spending in the 2015-16 signing period, he received a $950,000 bonus out of the ORGANIZATION. After a strong introduction to pro ball in the ORGANIZATION, the ORGANIZATION sent him to full-season ball in 2017. He took some understandable lumps but held his own before getting dealt to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION deal at the Deadline.PERSON hit .294/.367/.444 with 11 steals in the ORGANIZATION in 2016 and with his whippy left-handed swing and the leverage provided by his frame, he has considerable power potential that he'll begin to realize as he gets stronger. His quick hands are an asset as he tries to make more consistent contact as such a young hitter with such a naturally long stroke..PERSON has exceptional body control for someone his size and can play a decent shortstop. His size makes him destined to be a third baseman, and he has the agility and arm strength to be a solid defender there. A long strider who has above-average speed underway, he'll probably lose a step once he fills out.",-1
"Signed by ORGANIZATION for $3.5 million on July 2, PERSON received the second-largest bonus of any prospect in the 2018-19 class after ranking No. 6 on ORGANIZATION's list of the Top 30 international prospects. Some scouts who saw PERSON as an amateur in the ORGANIZATION compared him to a young PERSON as a hard-hitting infielder with a good projectable body and a strong arm. While the odds are against PERSON having a Hall of Fame-caliber career like GPE, he does have one of the higher offensive ceilings in the system. PERSON is a good athlete and has across-the-board tools, though it's his potential from the right side of the plate that has club officials the most excited. Combining a rhythmic swing with plus bat speed, he impacts the ball to the big parts of the field with authority. He'll need to clean up his swing some in the coming years like any young hitter, but all the ingredients are there for PERSON to develop into an average hitter. His power, meanwhile, could play close to plus when all is said and done, as PERSON has considerable room to grow into his projectable frame. PERSON has average speed but may lose a step or two over time as he fills out physically. It may also force him from shortstop to third base long-term, though PERSON has the tools and skills, including solid defensive actions, advanced body control and above-average arm strength, needed to profile at either position. Questions about his future defensive home aside, PERSON's bat may be good enough to offset any concerns about him moving down the defensive spectrum.",-1
"Ranked as ORGANIZATION's No. 4 international prospect, PERSON has received some comparisons to a young PERSON as a hard-hitting infielder with a good projectable body and a strong arm.

With solid actions in the field to go along with body control and an above-average arm, PERSON could develop into a quality defender at either position. However, it's PERSON's bat is his calling card and could one day help him reach the ORGANIZATION.",-1
"Signed for $300,000 in 2014, PERSON struggled in his first taste of pro ball the following year, hitting just .203 over 70 games in the ORGANIZATION. He did anything but struggle in his 2016 GPE debut, when he paced the Rookie-level PERSON in both home runs (eight) and slugging percentage (.556) en route to the circuit's ORGANIZATION Award.Already strong and physical, PERSON possesses plus raw power to all fields from the right side of the plate and showed the ability to apply it in games consistently in the ORGANIZATION. However, strikeouts have been an issue early in his career because he has a long swing as well as pitch-recognition issues, and he'll need to tone down his overly aggressive approach to make more consistent contact at higher levels. Defensively, PERSON has prototypical tools for right field, with good athleticism and speed and a plus arm.With robust raw power but concerns about his bat, PERSON is the definition of a high-risk prospect at this stage in his career.

"An international signee in 2014 out of GPE, PERSON spent his first pro season in the ORGANIZATION before heading stateside for his GPE debut in 2015. While a 25-game suspension for a performance-enhancing substance that year delayed the start of his season until July, PERSON impressed with his pitchability and his knack for generating ground balls once he got on the mound.A projectable right-hander, PERSON pitches with mostly average velocity but at times will show a 94-95 mph fastball. The pitch stands out more for it's late movement, thrown with hard sinking action that nets him plenty of grounders and consistently induces weak contact. His slider is his go-to secondary offering, flashing above-average potential with late break, and his changeup gives him a distinct third pitch, albeit one that may only be average at best once developed.PERSON doesn't miss many bats even though he's an aggressive strike-thrower, and some evaluators believe he'll ultimately serve as a reliever based on the strength of his fastball-slider pairing. But in an A's organization that's had plenty of success with pitchers of a similar profile, PERSON will be given every opportunity to remain a starter.",-1
"When the ORGANIZATION sent PERSON and PERSON to the Cardinals in late July, the trade paid immediate dividends with PERSON, who slammed 14 homers in two months with GPE.

He had dominated in GPE's 15-and-under league and starred for the island's youth national teams before defecting.PERSON has an electric arm and quickly caught scouts' attention by displaying a low-90s fastball and topping out at 97 mph as a 16-year-old in the months leading up to his signing. He also showed the makings of a plus slider with power and bite. He's in the early stages of developing a splitter/changeup that could give him a solid third offering.PERSON has a strong frame that should provide the durability necessary to be a starter. There's some effort to his delivery and his arm action isn't the most pristine, yet he has a history of throwing strikes against amateur competition. He likes to vary his arm slot, adding to his deception.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION' trade for PERSON last July gave them not only a surprising slugger who hit 14 homers in the final two months of the season, but also international bonus pool money in exchange for shipping PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION. They used most of that extra cash to sign PERSON for $600,000 the next day. He had overmatched PERSON's 15-and-under league and starred for its youth national teams before defecting.Somewhat reminiscent of former ORGANIZATION star PERSON, PERSON has a seemingly endless combination of pitches and arm slots. He has an electric arm that produces 92-95 mph fastballs that top out at 97 with high spin rates that give him riding life up in the strike zone. His hard curveball is a bit more effective than his harder slider, with both displaying the potential to become plus pitches, and his changeup has splitter action and similar upside.Though PERSON varying his arm angle adds to his deception, GPE probably will try to condense his pitch/slot options. Minor aches and pains have limited him in 2019. He doesn't have the cleanest arm action and there's effort in his delivery, yet he had no difficulty throwing strikes as an amateur. He has a lofty ceiling, as his chance to develop four plus offerings could make him a frontline starter.",-1
"PERSON comes from a baseball family, as his father PERSON played three years of pro ball and he's a cousin of PERSON and PERSON. He works out with PERSON, who helped prepare him for the mental challenges of pro ball after the PERSON signed him for $1.35 million in the second round last June. One of the youngest players in the GPE, PERSON was still just 17 when PERSON promoted him to low Class A for the final month of his debut. He's expected to miss the 2019 season after having surgery to repair a tibial stress fracture in his right leg in late March.Bat speed and natural talent stand out with PERSON, who has the makings of being a 20-home-run player. He regularly produced exit velocities greater than 100 mph in his pro debut, though he also struck out in 28 percent of his at-bats and needs to hone his approach. He has average speed and the savvy to be a threat for double-digit steals.The question will be how long PERSON remains at shortstop. He has a quick first step and enough arm to make plays there now, but his sturdy frame may eventually dictate a move to second base or perhaps the hot corner. Some evaluators believe he has the athleticism to wind up in center field.",-1
"Back in 1989, PERSON was a 22nd-round ORGANIZATION pick of the ORGANIZATION who went on to play parts of three seasons in pro ball. Nearly two decades later, it was his son PERSON' turn, as the ORGANIZATION selected the ORGANIZATION prep infielder, who is also the cousin of both PERSON and PERSON, in the second round after he batted .535 with 23 extra-base hits over 26 games as a high school senior. One of youngest prospects in his class at 17, PERSON bypassed a ORGANIZATION State PERSON commitment in favor of a slightly above slot bonus ($1.35 million) and then made his professional debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League. PERSON has a tremendous toolbox to work with and they were sharpening as the spring wore on. The right-handed hitter struggled as a freshman but improved markedly in subsequent years, showing the ability to impact the baseball consistently. The better he's gotten at getting the barrel to the ball, the more his raw power is showing up in games, and he was clearing fences a lot more as the ORGANIZATION approached. At one point, it seemed like PERSON might need to move to an outfield corner, but his defense has improved to the point where he should be able to remain on the dirt, perhaps even at shortstop, with moves to third or second a possibility as well.PERSON has the raw tools to become an impact player regardless of his ultimate defensive home. For now, however, the ORGANIZATION will keep him at shortstop as they hope to maximize his potential as a hard-hitting, up-the-middle player.",-1
"After the ORGANIZATION failed to sign PERSON and had leftover money in their bonus pool, they pivoted and landed three other premium international prospects, the best of whom is PERSON.

In his 2018 pro debut, PERSON finished third in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION batting race at ORGANIZATION has some of the best bat-to-ball skills in the GPE system, uses the entire field and controls the strike zone. Some scouts expressed concerns about his hitting ability when he was an amateur but he has calmed down his right-handed swing. He may max out at 12-15 homers per year, though he has some wiry strength and shows occasional pull-side power.With his on-base ability and plus-plus speed, PERSON could become a dynamic basestealer. There were teams that projected him as a center fielder, but the ORGANIZATION like his infield actions and believe he can stay at shortstop. He has improved his consistency since turning pro and also looked fine at second base in his debut.",-1
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in March 2016, GPE spent his professional debut in the ORGANIZATION before making the jump stateside the following year and finishing in the Rookie-level PERSON. After he impressed with his raw ability on both sides of the ball, the ORGANIZATION acquired GPE in October to complete the trade that had sent PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION two months earlier. GPE has present strength to his athletic frame, and it's easy to envision him adding considerably more muscle as he continues to mature physically. Though his right-handed swing can be inconsistent and pull happy, GPE does have a quick bat and makes hard contact, giving him a chance to hit for average. He'll never offer much in the way of home run power but has enough pop and the above-average speed needed to accrue his share of doubles and triples. GPE is plenty capable of playing shortstop, but he's spent much of 2018 manning the hot corner for Rookie-level Princeton in deference to phenom PERSON. Some believe GPE is best suited for second base, where he could be a solid defender with a strong arm.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION have challenged PERSON since signing him for $175,000 out of GPE in 2016, bringing him to the GPE early in his 2017 pro debut and advancing him to low Class A this July at age 19. His game is similar to that of GPE's 2019 first-rounder PERSON in that he doesn't have any loud tools but his instincts enable him to get the most out of his physical ability. He'll need time but could develop into an everyday shortstop. A right-handed hitter, PERSON has some of the best bat-to-ball skills in the lower levels of the ORGANIZATION system. He needs to develop more patience because he presently makes a lot of weak groundball contact. He won't ever be a slugger, but he does have some pull power and could produce double-digit home runs on an annual basis once he gets stronger.Both PERSON's speed and arm earn solid to plus grades. He's an aggressive runner with a knack for stealing bases and has smooth actions at shortstop. His internal clock helps him make plays and he has the versatility needed for a utility role if he doesn't hit enough to be a regular.",-1
"Everywhere he's played baseball, PERSON has hit, and that didn't stop when the ORGANIZATION selected him in the third round of the 2018 Draft out of ORGANIZATION. PERSON made his professional debut with PERSON Short-Season Tri-City, and he tore through the league with a .335 batting average and .835 ORGANIZATION. He was promoted to PERSON Fort Wayne for its run to the playoffs, and he starred there, too, upping his average to .336 and his ORGANIZATION to .846. PERSON finished his debut season with 100 hits -- no small feat for a June draftee who only saw time in 75 games.PERSON has a knack for making solid contact from the right side the plate, producing line drives from line to line with his compact stroke. He also boasts a strong feel for the strike zone, even if he probably won't offer much power in the long-term.PERSON is an above-average runner but has gains to make as a base-stealer, where he needs to improve his reads and jumps. At shortstop, PERSON boasts solid range and solid hands. But his arm checks in as below average. PERSON played some third in his debut season, and he could see time at second as well. But for now, PERSON plans to give him every chance to stick at short.",-1
"GPE shortstops with well-rounded tools and a solid track record of performance are always coveted in the GPE, especially those with a dearth of up-the-middle talent. PERSON stood out this spring among a weak crop of college shortstops, hitting .384/.433/.537 and offering quality defense on the dirt over 52 games at ORGANIZATION. It helped earn him a third-round selection by the ORGANIZATION in June, and after signing for below slot value, PERSON made his professional debut with PERSON Short-Season Tri-City.PERSON has a knack for making solid contact from the right side the plate, producing line drives from line to line with his compact stroke. He'll never offer much in the way of over-the-fence power, but there's enough strength to his swing to project him for plenty of doubles and the occasional home run. PERSON is an above-average runner who moves well once underway but needs to improve his reads and jumps as a basestealer.PERSON is a solid defender at shortstop, one with good range and hands but a below-average arm. He'll likely end up at the keystone as a result, although PERSON plans to give him every chance to stick at short early in his career.",-1
"Despite interest from college football programs, PERSON gave up quarterbacking as a high school senior to focus on pitching and adding strength. He developed into one of the more athletic and projectable prep arms in the 2018 Draft and signed for an above-slot $1.5 million in the second round. The ORGANIZATION held all of their high school pitchers from the early rounds out of game action to concentrate on learning and conditioning after they turned pro, but he still succumbed to PERSON surgery this May and won't make his pro debut until 2020.PERSON has the potential for a deep arsenal with plus pitches across the board. His fastball velocity fluctuates because he's still adding muscle to his lean frame, but there are times when he'll sit at 93-95 mph with armside run and that should happen more often as he gets stronger. Though he flashed a plus slider in high school, the ORGANIZATION are having him focus on a curveball with high spin rates, and he also has advanced feel for a fading changeup.Had he gone to college, PERSON would have been a two-way player at GPE, and his athleticism helps him repeat his delivery and throw strikes. He'll need time to mature physically and gain experience, but all of the ingredients are there for a future No. 2 or 3 starter.",-1
"Though college programs showed interest in him as a quarterback, PERSON gave up football as a high school senior to concentrate on baseball and work on adding strength. That decision paid off, as he starred at showcase events last fall and displayed the potential for a formidable four-pitch arsenal this spring. The ORGANIZATION drafted him in the second round and lured him away from a GPE commitment with an over-slot $1.5 million bonus.PERSON still has a lot of projection remaining in his lean, athletic frame, so he's not a fully formed pitcher by any means. There are days when his fastball sits at 89-91 mph and others when he works at 93-95 mph with armside run on his fastball for three innings at a time, something that should happen more frequently as he adds muscle. He has a full array of secondary pitches, flashing a plus slider, generating impressive spin rates on his curveball and demonstrating advanced feel for a fading changeup.Once he's a finished product, PERSON could have four pitches that grade as solid or better. The athleticism that could have made him a two-way player for the ORGANIZATION should help him throw strikes. He'll continue to try to get stronger in the early stages of his development as a pro.",-1
"PERSON showed off his skills at the ORGANIZATION in February 2015, racking up a pair of hits and scoring a run in three games. He also displayed plate discipline with a pair of walks. That performance, along with PERSON's potential to develop average-or-better tools across the board, earned him an $800,000 bonus from the ORGANIZATION in July 2016. He was impressive during his pro debut the next year, finishing in the Rookie-level PERSON, then showed off an interesting combination of power and speed while manning center field as an 18-year-old in the ORGANIZATION. Having added strength to his projectable frame since signing, PERSON now looks like a player who might be able to hit for both average and power from the right side of the plate. Though he's considered to be an aggressive hitter, PERSON has impressed ORGANIZATION club officials with his feel for the strike zone and willingness to work deep at-bats. The same can be said about his ability to hit to all fields while flashing raw power. On defense, PERSON has a solid arm and the defensive actions to stay in center field. But with his remaining physical projection, there's also a non-zero chance that he'll be forced off the position and end up as a corner outfielder.",-1
"The younger brother of GPE outfielder PERSON, PERSON has some similarities to his brother, though he wasn't quite as highly regarded coming out of PERSON in GPE.

Because of his size, there is some length to his left-handed swing which was a concern for some scouts. He did make some nice adjustments this spring, which helped raise his overall offensive profile, though he looked hesitant at times. A plus runner with a solid arm and defensive skills, he has the chance to stick in center and can handle any outfield position. If it all clicks for PERSON, who homered in the third game of his professional career in the ORGANIZATION, he has 20-20 potential with the ability to stay up the middle.

After signing for a below-slot $397,500 as a redshirt junior, he quickly earned a promotion to low Class A in his pro debut.PERSON had some of the best raw power in the 2019 college crop, with some scouts grading it as plus-plus. His prodigious strength and the bat speed in his right-handed swing give him the ability to drive the ball out of the park to all fields. There are questions as to how he'll make contact against better competition and with wood bats after a so-so performance in the ORGANIZATION in the summer of 2018, but he does have some patience and has fared well in his first taste of pro ball.

The Tribe still managed to land a first-round-caliber talent with their first overall pick, however, selecting GPE prep outfielder PERSON, arguably the fastest player in his class, in the second round, and then signing him away from a ORGANIZATION State commitment with a $988,970 bonus. PERSON possesses elite, 80-grade speed. Over the summer, he consistently clocked in with some of the best 60-yard-dash times, and also showed he knows how to use that speed on both sides of the ball. He's a major basestealing threat and he can cover a lot of ground in center field. While he still has much to learn, the ORGANIZATION's hit tool isn't bad and he finds the barrel a bit more consistently than fellow ORGANIZATION, a former first-round pick, did. There is strength to be added to his 6-foot-1 frame, an athletic body some feel is also the best in this class, so there might be some power to come.Whether PERSON reaches his lofty ceiling will depend on the development of his hit tool in the coming years. If it comes enough, PERSON could be the kind of dynamic leadoff hitter teams covet, but rarely find.",-1
"Before PERSON rose up ORGANIZATION boards this year, the last ORGANIZATION high schooler taken in the first round was when PERSON was selected by the ORGANIZATION 19th overall back in 2010. PERSON, who was also a football standout for Cary-Grove's ORGANIZATION 6-A state champion team, beat Foltynewicz by one spot, going No. 18 overall and signing for $3.4 million.It's hard not to like PERSON's athleticism and the ease of his arm action. His four-seam fastball can reach 97 mph with riding life, though his heavy two-seamer in the low 90s may be even more effective because it gets exceptional horizontal and vertical movement. PERSON's 2019 ORGANIZATION high school player of the year also has an outstanding curveball that sits around 80 mph with tight spin and good depth.PERSON hasn't had much need for a changeup to this point and will need to achieve greater velocity separation from his fastball, but his athleticism and intelligence should help him develop it into an effective third pitch. He throws a ton of strikes and has a better understanding of how to attack hitters than many prep pitchers. That, combined with his durable and projectable frame, point to an exciting future.",-1
"The big name the ORGANIZATION got at the start of the 2015-16 international signing period was PERSON, who got $4 million to sign in July 2015. But the ORGANIZATION also signed PERSON, a one-time infielder who had moved behind the plate. The ORGANIZATION got him for $200,000, which is starting to look like a bargain. After a strong pro debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2016, the ORGANIZATION backstop had a pedestrian GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in '17, but jumped on the map with an All-Star performance in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League a year ago.PERSON has the chance to be a solid all-around catcher, with skills on both sides of the ball. He can catch and throw with excellent accuracy, having thrown out nearly 36 percent of potential basestealers thus far in his pro career. A good receiver and blocker, he's worked on his GPE so he can communicate with his pitching staff well and displays outstanding leadership traits. Offensively, PERSON has a good swing and line-drive approach from both sides of the plate with the chance to be an average hitter and perhaps eventually average power. While he's a well-below-average runner, he's athletic and plays with the kind of energy behind the plate that teams and fans love to see. His defense will be the key, but he looks like he'll swing the bat well enough to potentially be a big league regular.",-1

"When the ORGANIZATION needed an extra catcher to handle pitchers at a workout in the ORGANIZATION, they summoned GPE, who wound up being the most impressive player there. An under-the-radar signing for $25,000 in July 2017, he ranked third in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION in GPE (1.004) and walks (53) during his pro debut the next year. He has continued to produce after arriving in the GPE this summer.GPE has an extremely patient approach for a teenager. He isn't afraid to work deep counts because he has good bat-to-ball skills. While most of his present power comes to the pull side, he's strong and could develop into a 20-homer threat with more strength and experience.A former shortstop, GPE moves well for a catcher but is still learning behind the plate. While he has solid arm strength, he needs to quicken his transfer and shorten his arm action to better combat the running game. He has the makeup to succeed as a backstop, with club officials praising his intelligence and leadership skills.",-1
"ORGANIZATION made some noise over the summer on the showcase circuit, playing well enough to make ORGANIZATION's 18U team that won gold. He showed promise with the bat during the spring at FACILITY, though an inconsistent campaign had many teams believing that ORGANIZATION would honor his commitment to ORGANIZATION. Despite questions surrounding his signability, the GPE made it a moot point by signing ORGANIZATION for $900,000 -- well above his slot's recommended bonus of $235,600 -- after taking him in the sixth round. He rewarded the organization with a red-hot start at the plate during his professional debut in the Rookie-level PERSON. ORGANIZATION's carrying tool is his bat. A switch-hitter, he has shown a feel to hit from both sides, and his bat speed should give him the chance to hit for both average and power as he progresses. There are more questions about his defense. A shortstop in high school, most feel he won't stay there because his below-average speed limits his range. He does have good hands and footwork there, while his above-average arm makes some believe he could play third. Otherwise, a future as an offensive-minded second baseman might make more sense.The GPE' willingness to go nearly four times over slot to sign ORGANIZATION speaks to their belief that his bat will play regardless of his future defensive home. He'll need time to develop, but the long-term payoff could be considerable if he comes anywhere close to reaching his ceiling.",-1
"Born in GPE, PERSON moved to GPE as a child and wound up DHing for the GPE national 18-and-under team that won a gold medal at the 2017 World Cup and featured a lineup with five future first-rounders and three other players who commanded seven-figure bonuses. He lasted until the sixth round in the 2018 Draft amid signability concerns but still landed a $900,000 bonus, the equivalent of late second-round money. He posted a .790 ORGANIZATION and ranked third in the Rookie-level PERSON with 30 walks during his pro debut.One of the more physical infielders in GPE's system, PERSON is a switch-hitter who has a chance to hit for average and power. He works counts well and has a track record of producing against top amateur competition. Though he slugged just .382 in his first taste of pro ball, he has the bat speed and projectable strength to develop into a 20-homer threat.PERSON bounced between shortstop, second base and third base during his debut, and his future defensive home remains in question. Though his instincts help him make plays at shortstop, his fringy speed and average arm won't hold up there in the long term. Second base may be his best bet, though he'd profile well at third base if he can strengthen his arm.",-1
"PERSON always look for raw power when scouting for any Draft, so many were interested in PERSON, who had spent all of last summer clearing fences on the showcase circuit. He showed legitimate pop during his senior season at ORGANIZATION, and questions about his ability to make contact hurt his value a bit, but the ORGANIZATION clearly believed he'll hit enough to tap into that plus tool by giving him an above pick value bonus of nearly $1.8 million to sign as a second-round pick.PERSON has a history of performing on big stages, including PERSON's ORGANIZATION during All-Star Weekend. It's not just batting practice power, as PERSON did hit two homers during his stint at the ORGANIZATION of PERSON last summer. But with that power came with it a lot of swing and miss, with scouts worrying about his pitch recognition, particularly his ability to pick up spin. PERSON, PERSON will be able to stick at third, where his power bat would profile well. He does have enough arm for the spot, though the jury is still out whether he can man the hot corner long-term. While he's much better on quick, reactive plays, he struggles when he has time to worry about his footwork. He has seen some time in the outfield, but that hasn't gone well.One scout compared PERSON defensively to Phillies prospect PERSON, who was the ORGANIZATION. 3 overall pick in last year's Draft. PERSON was a Futures Gamer for the Phillies in 2019 and the ORGANIZATION would be thrilled if PERSON can develop into that kind of prospect.",-1
"PERSON endeared himself to scouts with his lightning-quick arm, and even though he endured a side injury during his senior season, the ORGANIZATION gambled on his upside. They gave the right-hander $1.9 million, more than twice slot value, after selecting him with the 71st overall pick in the 2016 Draft. In his two full Minor League seasons, PERSON has yet to find any measure of consistency, with an ERA hovering around 5. But all the while, he's continued to flash promising stuff and a high ceiling.PERSON's velocity dipped a bit upon his introduction to pro ball, but it returned in 2018 in the Class A Advanced California League. He operates in the mid-90s with a mid-70s curveball that can be a hammer when thrown right. Scouts believe the curve will continue to improve as PERSON fills out physically, but he's yet to show great command of the pitch. PERSON also features a promising changeup that quickly has become a third weapon for him.An excellent athlete, PERSON will need to continue to add strength and hone his athleticism. He's made strides with the consistency of his delivery, but he still needs to cut down on his walk totals. Thus far, PERSON's numbers haven't been great. But the ORGANIZATION feel he's only scratching the surface. Once he harnesses his talents, he could develop into a back-end starter or a dominant bullpen option.",-1
"After PERSON, a tall, projectable and athletic right-hander, pitched extremely well over the course of the summer showcase circuit, scouts were excited to see what kind of progress he would show this spring. Instead, they were largely disappointed, as PERSON's stuff backed up and then a side injury sidelined him for much of the spring. The ORGANIZATION still were willing to gamble on the upside he showed during summer, as they gave the right-hander $1.9 million, more than twice slot value, after drafting him with the 71st overall pick. In the summer, PERSON was touching 94 mph with his fastball and showed good improvement with his breaking ball. But he didn't take the step forward in velocity many hoped to see during the spring, and his secondary stuff took a step backward. He'll throw a decent breaking ball now and again, but it's often too slow at 71-73 mph. He is still throwing strikes, however, and his athleticism, strong frame and easy arm action are still impressive.In spite of his inconsistent spring, PERSON, who had committed to PERSON before signing with the ORGANIZATION, can flash power stuff at times, and there's plenty to dream on with his athletic and projectable frame.",-1

"GPE first-round pick PERSON wasn't the only blue-chip prospect at ORGANIZATION (PERSON, Ga.) this spring. PERSON actually entered the year with a higher profile and dropped to the 24th round only because he was strongly committed to GPE. The ORGANIZATION managed to lure him away from the ORGANIZATION with a $500,000 bonus.PERSON is a true speedster who can cover 60 yards in less than 6.5 seconds and get from the right side of the plate to first base in 3.6 seconds on a drag bunt. He projects a basestealing threat and a quality defender in center field.Some area scouts thought that PERSON will need to make adjustments to his right-handed swing in pro ball. He has a choppy stroke with some arm bar, and it can get long when he gets overly aggressive. He does have impressive hand-eye coordination and bat speed, so he could hit for average with some power once he refines his swing and gets stronger.",-1
"PERSON flocked to PERSON (Ga.) High last spring to see PERSON and PERSON. While the latter ended up going to the ORGANIZATION with the ORGANIZATION. 11 overall pick, PERSON, who was believed to have a strong commitment to GPE, lasted until the 24th round, where he was taken by the ORGANIZATION and lured away from the ORGANIZATION with a $500,000 bonus.PERSON is a top-flight athlete with double-plus speed that allows him to cover 60 yards in less than 6.5 seconds and get from the right side of the plate to first base in a blistering 3.6 seconds on a drag bunt. Those wheels also make him a threat to steal on the basepaths as well as a quality defender in center field, where he has outstanding range and closing speed.Some scouts worry about PERSON's ability to hit, citing his raw hitting mechanics and lack of physical strength as areas of concern. His hand-eye coordination and bat speed offer reasons to be optimistic, though, and he has the makings of a top-of-the-order center fielder if everything comes together.",-1
"PERSON flashed a low-90s fastball as an GPE high schooler in 2016, but he went undrafted because he battled injuries during his senior year and was strongly committed to GPE. He missed all of his first year with the ORGANIZATION following PERSON surgery, and worked just 24 2/3 innings during the regular season this spring, albeit while hitting 98 mph with his fastball as a rare Draft-eligible redshirt freshman. That velocity along with PERSON's lack of mileage on the mound intrigued the ORGANIZATION, who selected him with their third-round pick. PERSON has worked at 95-98 mph in short stints, generating velocity without much effort. He'll occasionally throw some sharp mid-80s sliders, but for the most part his breaking ball has been below average. He has used his changeup so infrequently that it's best described as a work in progress.Though he has thrown strikes, PERSON has been hit harder than expected for someone with a mid-90s fastball. He needs to improve his command and his secondary pitches to keep batters off his heater. He could be a late-inning force when all is said and done, though there's also a chance that the ORGANIZATION will see what he can do as a starter before relegating him to a permanent bullpen role.",-1

"Signed for $275,000 in September 2014, PERSON made his GPE debut two years later and then established himself as a rising prospect in '17. Pitching as a 19-year-old in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League, he posted a 2.35 ERA with a 0.96 ORGANIZATION and a circuit-best .171 opponents' average in 61 1/3 frames. PERSON' move up to full-season ball in 2018 came with even better results, most notably a strikeout rate that jumped to 10.4 K/9 from 8.8 the previous year. Moving up to the ORGANIZATION State League in 2019, PERSON got off to a shaky start before landing on the injured list in mid-April with a left forearm strain. PERSON stands out for his remaining physical projection, as he already shows a fast arm with plenty of room to grow into his 6-foot-2, 170-pound frame. That leads scouts to believe he'll add more velocity to a fastball that currently sits in the low 90s and bumps 94. His curveball is an above-average offering, one thrown with tight spin and late biting action, and he also shows some feel for a changeup.PERSON is athletic and has a clean, repeatable arm action which aids him as a strike-thrower, and he should develop at least average command as well.

"GPE PERSON won the ORGANIZATION World Series in 2017 with one of the most stacked rosters in recent junior college history. A total of 11 players from the program were drafted in 2017, led by PERSON, who went No. 57 overall, in the second round. He struggled out of the gate during his debut in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League, showing there's work to be done.PERSON has legitimate raw power, but the question is whether he'll be able to make the adjustments necessary to tap into it consistently. The mechanics of his swing led to him having trouble with balls on the inner part of the plate and a fair amount of swings and misses as a result. He'll have to smooth out those rough edges to become a serious offensive threat from the left side of the plate. Largely a first baseman at GPE, the ORGANIZATION had the GPE native play a lot of right field during his debut. He'll continue to play both spots in 2018, likely more at first, but it's hard to walk away from his strong arm in an outfield corner.Regardless of his defensive home, it's going to be PERSON's bat that allows him to climb up the ORGANIZATION' ladder. How he adjusts in his first pro season should speak volumes about his future impact.",-1
"GPE ORGANIZATION won the ORGANIZATION World Series thanks to a high-octane offense that hit over .350 and slugged .560. PERSON's left-handed bat with power was a huge part of that, with his top 10 finish nationally in batting average, on-base percentage and slugging a big reason why the ORGANIZATION took him in the second round and signed him for a below-pick value $850,000.PERSON has some serious raw power to tap into and he did so at GPE. Some scouts felt he had a tendency to push his hands away from his body at times, leaving him susceptible to balls in on him, leading to swings and misses. Others feel he'll hit more than enough to be a consistent threat as a pro, far from an all-or-nothing power guy. While he largely played first base at GPE, he runs better than you'd think given his size and the ORGANIZATION were giving him a lot of time in right field during his debut, where his strong arm could play well.PERSON's bat has the chance to profile well at either the infield or outfield corner. Obviously, his value is greater if he can patrol the outfield, but his left-handed swing should carry him up the ladder regardless.",-1
"A year after giving PERSON seven figures to sign out of the ORGANIZATION, the ORGANIZATION went back to his trainer, PERSON, to find PERSON. PERSON too young to sign during the 2013 signing period, PERSON had to wait until late August to sign for $725,000. He made his debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2014 and came stateside for the ORGANIZATION League the following season. While PERSON' numbers don't look great, the ORGANIZATION are excited to see how his numerous tools develop.While PERSON does have a long way to go, the left-handed hitter has good bat speed and a decent setup at the plate. There's some power to come as well as he matures and grows into his body. An average runner, PERSON has played all three outfield spots during his brief career, seeing more time in center than any place else, with a chance to stay there. PERSON will be 18 for nearly all of the 2016 season, and he will need to show improvement in terms of maturity and everyday consistency, not uncommon for a player of his age and experience. PERSON will be key, but the payoff could be considerable.",-1
"The younger brother of PERSON, who spent six years as a catcher in the ORGANIZATION system, PERSON signed for $500,000 out of GPE in 2015. He initially impressed with his defense, which allowed him to make his GPE debut at age 18 and reach short-season ball at 19. He has improved offensively while repeating the LOCATION in 2019, needing just eight games to match his home run total (four) from his first three seasons and 148 pro games.After catching for ORGANIZATION righty prospect PERSON as an amateur, PERSON got used to handling quality stuff at a young age. He has the makings of a solid receiver and continues to get better in that regard, and he has a strong, accurate arm that helps shut down the running game. He moves well behind the plate and has the leadership skills required of a catcher.PERSON employed more of a contact-oriented, pull-happy approach early in his pro career, but he's doing a better job of driving the ball to all fields this summer. A right-handed hitter, he creates legitimate opposite-field power with his strength and has a ceiling of a .260 hitter with 15 homers per season. To get there, he'll need to continue to maintain the strides he has made with not chasing pitches out of the zone and waiting for ones he can hammer.",-1
"A big international signing by the ORGANIZATION in July 2013, PERSON had excited GPE about his potential. The ORGANIZATION are clearly also intrigued, obtaining the young ORGANIZATION lefty in a January trade with the ORGANIZATION.While some might be concerned that PERSON isn't the biggest guy in the world, his stuff and feel for pitching point to a future in a rotation, even if that big league future is still far off in the distance. He has a relatively simple and clean delivery that allows him to throw strikes, though he's still working on repeating it consistently. PERSON can locate his fastball to both sides of the plate, a skill that doesn't often come until much later for prospects. His curveball is his go-to pitch, though he can fall in love with it too much. He has a feel for a changeup, but it's behind the other two offerings.PERSON has grown some, both in height and weight, and he might not be done growing, though his size might be the only thing that's not projectable about him.",-1
"PERSON jumped on the prospect map as a 17-year-old in a weak GPE farm system after a strong pro debut in the GPE. The ORGANIZATION southpaw joined the ORGANIZATION via trade in 2015, and while he's had up-and-down results since, the ORGANIZATION thought highly enough of him to add him to the 40-man roster after he reached the ORGANIZATION State League at age 20 in 2017. Though he advanced to Double-A this past season, PERSON was designated for assignment in late November and dealt to the ORGANIZATION a few days later.PERSON still has excellent pure stuff with the chance to have three at least average pitches in a starting pitching profile. His fastball will get up to 94 mph and he throws it with good movement, he can spin a very good breaking ball and his changeup flashes above-average to plus at times. While he has a very clean arm action, he has struggled to repeat his mechanics and has thus had command and control problems.For PERSON to take the next step he has to believe his stuff is as good as everyone else thinks it is. That, and learning to limit damage in a big inning, will be important hurdles for him to clear as he works through the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION' system.",-1
"It can be a tremendous learning experience to watch your peers pass you by. PERSON was part of an ultra-talented Rome rotation in 2016 that helped the team win the LOCATION title. PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON all took big steps forward and starred in the postseason. PERSON had an up-and-down season and did not throw a playoff pitch.While PERSON showed his youth at times, he also showed the pure stuff that made him a top international prospect, one the ORGANIZATION were happy to sign in 2013 before eventually trading him to the ORGANIZATION in January 2015. He has a clean, quick arm action that can deliver fastballs up to 94 mph with good late life on it. He'll flash a plus breaking ball and changeup at times, though not consistently. With more maturity will come the ability to minimize damage when things don't go his way.PERSON has struggled with conditioning in the past, but he did show up in ORGANIZATION this past spring in very good shape, though that did not translate to good results in the ORGANIZATION State League. He has some work to do to catch up to the young arms who moved ahead of him on the depth chart.",-1
"PERSON was the top international acquisition by the ORGANIZATION in the 2013-14 signing period, getting $580,000 to sign out of GPE. He showed up quickly on prospect lists when he made a precocious pro debut in the GPE, pitching well in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION. He's been enigmatic at best since then, showing glimpses of ability but has now been traded twice, going to the ORGANIZATION prior to the 2015 season, earning a spot on the 40-man roster but then being designated for assignment following the 2018 season. The ORGANIZATION took a shot and acquired him for cash last November.PERSON has teased with his ability as a left-hander with three usable pitches. He'd have some good starts and appear to show progress, then just as quickly regress, watching many of the ORGANIZATION' pitching prospects pass him by. He'll flash above-average stuff across the board, with a live fastball up to 94 mph, an ability to really spin a breaking ball and a feel for a deceptive changeup. None of it has been consistent, and many reports last year barely had average grades across the board, as evaluators wonder when he'll take ownership and do the things he needs to do to take the next step in his development.The ORGANIZATION are hoping a change of scenery will help him, and being designated will be the wakeup call he needs. Despite all the ups and downs, PERSON will only be 22 for most of the 2019 season. There's time for him to unlock the potential he's shown in spurts, but the clock is ticking.",-1
"  PERSON was the ORGANIZATION' top signing in the 2013 international free agent class, and he made his professional debut in 2014 in the ORGANIZATION. After an impressive showing as a 17-year-old, PERSON was traded to the ORGANIZATION in January. Despite his young age, PERSON displayed an enticing combination of stuff and feel for pitching in his debut. Though his fastball typically sat around 90 mph, it touched 95 mph, and scouts believe he'll more regularly reach that velocity as he physically matures. His curveball is his best secondary offering, and he has a decent feel for his changeup, but it isn't as advanced as his other two pitches.PERSON has a clean, simple delivery, though he is still learning to consistently repeat it. If he can do so, he'll have all the tools necessary to succeed as a starter, even if he remains slightly undersized.",-1
"In January 2015, the ORGANIZATION sent PERSON and ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION. The return was PERSON, a young lefty with a good feel for pitching who is learning the important lessons of taking care of his body.Being out of shape led to some minor back problems for PERSON during his first crack at full-season ball at age 18. PERSON down in early July, the ORGANIZATION had PERSON stay at their complex in GPE to teach him about the importance of monitoring his weight and conditioning. He'll never be a physical specimen, but he showed a lot of progress in embracing the work by instructs. There's a lot to like about PERSON's arm. He'll sit 91-92 mph with his fastball, touching 94 mph, an average heater that plays up because of its good run and life. His curveball can be above-average and he has a good feel for his changeup as well. Improved conditioning should help his overall command as well as maintaining his stuff, with being in better shape leading to repeating his delivery consistently. The ORGANIZATION would love to see him follow in the footsteps of another slightly undersized lefty: PERSON.",-1
"GPE cemented his status as the best pitching prospect available in the 2018-19 international amateur class with a strong showing at ORGANIZATION's international showcase in the ORGANIZATION in February. Combining projectable stuff with precocious polish, the ORGANIZATION struck out six of the seven batters he faced. When the signing period opened on July 2, the ORGANIZATION immediately signed him for $1 million.GPE already operates with an 89- to 93-mph fastball, and his arm speed and growing frame hint at more velocity in the future. He has life on his heater and commands it well for his age, making it even more effective. His curveball has good shape and could be a plus pitch once it adds more power.Another sign of GPE's advanced feel for pitching is his aptitude for throwing a changeup. He repeats his mechanics well and fills the strike zone, and the lack of effort in his delivery enhances his chances of holding up as a starter. While he won't arrive at FACILITY for several years, he eventually could fit in the middle of the big league rotation.",-1
"The best pitching prospect in the 2018 international amateur class, PERSON wowed scouts by striking out six of the seven batters he faced at ORGANIZATION's international showcase in the ORGANIZATION that February. The ORGANIZATION signed him on the first day of the signing period, giving the Venezuelan a $1 million bonus. He's advanced enough that he came to the GPE for his pro debut this year.PERSON offers both projection and polish. He already works at 89-93 mph with his four-seam fastball, and his arm speed and potential to add strength mean that he could throw harder in the future. His curveball has good shape and, like his heater, could become a plus offering as he adds more power.PERSON's feel for a changeup and his ability to command his repertoire are unusual for a teenager. He has a clean delivery and repeats it well, which bodes well for his long-term durability. While he's several years away from the big leagues, he has one of the higher ceilings among GPE's pitching prospects and a better chance to reach it than most of them.",-1
"GPE comes from a baseball family, with a father who made it to Triple-A with the ORGANIZATION, an uncle who played in the ORGANIZATION organization and a brother who currently plays in the ORGANIZATION organization. PERSON made a name for himself as a three-year starter at ORGANIZATION and was one of the better performers in the ORGANIZATION, finishing his college career with a .323/.430/.498 batting line in 163 games. That consistency earned GPE a third-round selection by the Indians in June, and he continued to impress in his pro debut by raking at two levels en route to a full-season promotion. A left-handed hitter, GPE has outstanding on-base skills and a strong track record with the bat. He walked (103) far more often than he struck out (56) at ORGANIZATION, and that, along with his excellent speed, makes him a potential table-setter in the future. There is some raw power to tap into, though it's not a huge part of his game. Stealing bases is, however, and he has been very efficient on that front. Defensively, some see a move off of shortstop, mostly because his fringy arm won't play there, so it wasn't a surprise when he lined up at the keystone for much of his pro debut. GPE' on-base skills and bat will need to translate for him to be successful in the professional ranks, especially if he's forced further down the defensive spectrum. If at all clicks for him, GPE could develop into a bat-first, second-division regular at second base.",-1
"Though PERSON is shorter than his listed height of 5-foot-8, that didn't deter PERSON from spending $850,000 to sign him out of the ORGANIZATION in 2014. His size and style of play earn him repeated comparisons to former All-Star PERSON, who ended his career in the ORGANIZATION system last spring. PERSON came directly to the GPE for his 2015 pro debut and played well despite being hampered by a groin injury.A switch-hitter, PERSON naturally has a compact swing from both sides of the plate. He can surprise pitchers with some sneaky power and has the speed to steal bases, with both tools a grade below what GPE's were in his prime. His savvy reminds scouts of GPE as well, and PERSON believes he can mature into a leadoff hitter.PERSON has the quickness and range to play shortstop, and his very strong arm allows him to make all of the necessary throws. He exhibits good instincts in all facets of the game and earns praise for his makeup as well.",-1
"After signing for an over-slot $200,000 as a GPE high schooler in the 2017 Draft, PERSON worked just nine innings in his pro debut before a throw from catcher PERSON struck him in the head and gave him a concussion. PERSON inflammation truncated his 2018 season as well, but he has stayed healthy and emerged as one of the hardest throwers in the GPE system this summer.The ORGANIZATION liked PERSON's arm speed and the life on his fastball when they drafted him, banking that more velocity would come as he got stronger and cleaned up his mechanics. That's exactly what has happened, as his heater has risen from 89-92 mph in high school to a consistent 93-97 with a peak of 99. His curveball also has improved, becoming an absolute hammer at times.Relatively inexperienced for a third-year pro, PERSON still has a lot to learn. He's still gaining trust and feel for his changeup, and he needs more consistent command with his fastball and quality with his curveball. His control and command are works in progress and ultimately will determine whether he remains a starter or becomes a reliever with late-inning upside.",-1
"A mainstay on the summer showcase circuit, PERSON cemented his status as perhaps the best pure high school hitter in the class with his performance at several events. He capped it off by leading ORGANIZATION's 18 and Under ORGANIZATION in ORGANIZATION as it won gold in the Pan-American Championships, then took home the ORGANIZATION of the ORGANIZATION in GPE after batting .422 with eight homers as a ORGANIZATION HS (GPE, Fla.) senior. The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $6.18 million, slot value for the ORGANIZATION. 5 overall pick, and he spent all of nine games in the ORGANIZATION before earning a promotion to the Class A Short Season level.PERSON can flat-out hit, boasting a terrific approach with a smooth but explosive swing from the left side of the plate. It's more of a line-drive approach right now, but he did start driving the ball more over the summer and he'll show excellent raw power in batting practice, especially to the pull side. PERSON improved his athleticism and moved better during his senior year, both down the line and in the outfield. He still profiles best as a corner outfielder, which might mean left field because of a less-than-average arm.PERSON's advanced feel to hit along with his effortless raw power leads scouts to believe that his power will emerge earnestly in games as he adds strength to his projectable frame. Though he'll need time to develop, the final product could be that of a middle-of-the-order run producer who hits for both average and power.",-1
"One of the most explosive high school arms in years, PERSON drew PERSON comparisons and possessed a higher ceiling than anyone in the 2016 Draft. The ORGANIZATION gladly snapped him up with the ORGANIZATION. 4 overall pick and signed him for $4.8 million. His talent was evident when he made his pro debut against older competition in the Rookie-level PERSON, and so was his need for more polish.PERSON's fastball alone would make him intriguing, because it sits at 93-98 mph and climbs as high as 102, but there's much more to his arsenal. His power curveball already is a plus pitch, sometimes grades better than that, and he can alter it into a harder slider when he desires. Though he didn't need a changeup as an amateur, he already shows flashes of a plus change with some fade.The caveat with PERSON is that his control and command lag behind his stuff. He throws with considerable effort, leading to worries about his ability to stay healthy and locate his pitches in the long run. If he can learn tone down his delivery and do a better job of repeating it, he can become the homegrown ace the ORGANIZATION have tried to develop for years.",-1
"GPE showcased one of the best high school arms to come along this decade, earning him PERSON comparisons before the ORGANIZATION drafted him fourth overall and signed him for $4.8 million in 2016. They've handled him carefully as he makes the transition from thrower to pitcher, limiting his pitch counts as he tries to harness his stuff. He has been sidelined for much of this season, coming down with foreness stiffness in his first start in April and then straining an oblique two starts after returning in June.GPE's pure stuff is exciting, as he has the potential for four plus pitches -- if he can control them. He has an electric fastball that sits at 94-98 mph and has climbed as high as 102 with life and downhill plane, though he has yet to blow pro hitters away with it because he struggles to command it. He also can make hitters look bad with his pair of power breaking balls and his fading changeup but has had trouble getting ahead in the count to set up his secondary offerings.The ORGANIZATION have toned down what was considerable effort in GPE's delivery, but he still has trouble repeating his mechanics and finding the strike zone. His first order of business is to locate his fastball more consistently, and then he can spend more time refining his other pitches. Youth and athleticism are on his side, and if he figures everything out, he can be a frontline starter.",-1
"PERSON had the highest ceiling in the 2016 Draft, so the Rockies were delighted to get him with the ORGANIZATION. 4 overall choice. Signed for $4.8 million, he's the best mound prospect to come out of GPE since PERSON contended for the top pick in 2005 and the state's first prep pitcher selected in the first round since GPE Holman in 1983. PERSON's ORGANIZATION of the Year as a junior and senior, he led PERSON (ORGANIZATION) to the GPE state 5-A championship in 2016, striking out 12 in a quarterfinal victory and hitting the game-winning two-run double in the title game.After adding 15 pounds of muscle before his senior season, PERSON consistently works at 93-97 mph and tops out at 102 with his fastball. His power curveball already is a plus pitch, and he can manipulate it into a harder slider when desired. Though he didn't need a changeup against GPE high school competition, his already grades as a plus pitch with good fade.For all his upside, PERSON does come with risk as well. He doesn't throw strikes on a consistent basis because he has trouble repeating his mechanics and arm slot. The effort in his delivery leads to some concerns about his future command and health.",-1
"PERSON was one of the most exciting prospects in the 2016 PERSON, a big, strong high school right-hander capable of hitting triple digits consistently. There would need to be work done to turn him into a complete pitcher, sure, but the upside was too much for the ORGANIZATION to pass up with the ORGANIZATION. 4 overall pick, signing him for $4.8 million. He has had trouble gaining traction since, scuffling in his first full year and missing nearly all of 2018 due to first forearm stiffness then a strained oblique.Based on his profile and PERSON status, PERSON certainly hasn't lived up to expectations thus far. The good news is he's still only 21 years old and the premium stuff that excited everyone coming out of high school is still very much there. The 6-foot-4 righty still cranks his fastball up to 97-100 mph consistently. The ORGANIZATION feel he has the best curve in the system, one that flashes as a 70 pitch, though not consistently. His above-average slider also can buckle knees and his fading changeup gives him a fourth pitch that grades out as at least above-average.The one thing, other than health, that has held him back has been his ability to command the baseball. It will come down to him finding a way to control his effort and body, which will allow him to repeat his delivery and find the strike zone more consistently. A full season should help tremendously in him taking a step from thrower to pitcher, with a frontline starter ceiling still not unreasonable to dream about.",-1
"Though penalties for exceeding their international bonus pool in 2014-15 restricted them from paying more than $300,000 to any player in the next two signing periods, the ORGANIZATION still managed to land one of the top pitchers available in 2016. They grabbed ORGANIZATION out of the ORGANIZATION for $250,000 that July, then brought him to the GPE midway through his pro debut the following year. He excelled as one of the youngest starters (age 18) in the Class A Short-Season New York-Penn League this summer, needing just five outings to earn a promotion to low Class A.ORGANIZATION' fastball velocity has increased from 89-93 mph when he turned pro to 93-97 mph this season. He has good feel for spinning a curveball that has power and depth and shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch. His changeup featues some fade and is coming along nicely as well.ORGANIZATION' pitchability is as impressive as his stuff. He has a sound delivery and repeats it well, boding well for his future health and command. Though he's not tall, he's strong and athletic, which should help him hold up as a starter.",-1
"Though international bonus rules prohibited the ORGANIZATION from paying more than $300,000 in individual bonuses in 2016 after they overspent two years earlier, they still landed some intriguing talents. Slick-fielding shortstop PERSON ($250,000) became part of the ORGANIZATION trade with the ORGANIZATION, while right-hander PERSON ($50,000) has quality stuff and projectability. The best of the group is PERSON, who signed for $250,000 out of the ORGANIZATION and reached low Class A last year at age 18.Like many of the ORGANIZATION' best young pitching prospects, PERSON generates high spin rates on his fastball and breaking ball. His heater sat around 91 mph when he signed and now ranges from 93-97 with riding action up in the strike zone. He has nice feel for spinning a hard curveball with good shape and the potential to give him a second plus offering. PERSON is also making progress with a fading changeup that will help him against left-handers. He repeats his delivery well and fills the strike zone. Though he's only 6 feet tall, his sound mechanics, strength and athleticism should allow him to remain a starter.",-1
"PERSON PERSON is best known as a wide receiver who played six seasons in the ORGANIZATION, but he also was the last PERSON position player selected in the first five rounds (third round to the Brewers in 1992). PERSON added his name to that very short list in 2018, going to the ORGANIZATION in the fifth round after an all-star summer in the ORGANIZATION and a strong junior campaign in which he batted .311/.386/.538 with 15 doubles, 11 homers and 36 RBIs in 53 games for the Hawkeyes.PERSON's most attractive tool is his power potential, the product of strength, solid bat speed and loft in his left-handed swing. There are times when he focuses on using the opposite field, and others when he gets pull-happy and vulnerable on the other half. He makes consistent contact and draws his share of walks.While PERSON is slow out of the box, he moves well for a 6-foot-3, 210-pounder and has at least average speed once he gets going. He plays right field for PERSON and possesses an average arm, though most scouts project him as a left fielder in pro ball. He needs to improve his reads and routes as a defender, and he has the work ethic to get the job done.",-1
"Based on the early returns, the ORGANIZATION' $60,000 investment to sign PERSON out of the ORGANIZATION in 2017 could pay off nicely. After a steady if unspectacular pro debut that summer, he has come to the GPE in 2018 and emerged as one of the more polished young pitchers in the system. PERSON could have three solid pitches once he's fully developed. He already sits at 92 mph and reaches 94 with his fastball, which features running action. He has advanced feel for a changeup that presently grades better than his curveball, which has good shape but lacks power.PERSON doesn't have a lot of projection remaining, so he's unlikely to grow into a power pitcher. But he's a savvy left-hander who throws strikes with three offerings and could develop into a No. 4 starter. His floor is higher than that of most 18-year-old southpaws.",-1
"PERSON went unsigned in the 2016 international signing period before landing a $60,000 bonus out of the ORGANIZATION Republic the following June. He made his GPE debut at age 18 last summer, averaging 11.7 strikeouts per nine innings while helping the ORGANIZATION win the Rookie-level PERSON championship. He has drawn comparisons to a smaller version of PERSON, who jumped from high Class A in 2017 to GPE last year.PERSON shows the potential for three solid pitches once he matures physically. He operates at 90-93 mph and reaches 95 with running action on his fastball, setting up an advanced changeup that he throws with the same arm speed. His curveball has more shape than power at this point.His athleticism allows PERSON to repeat his delivery, which bodes well for his ability to provide strikes and stay healthy. While he doesn't have a ton of projection remaining, his combination of stuff and savvy gives him a ceiling of a No. 4 starter. He also has a higher floor than most teenaged southpaws and could start to advance quickly.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION signed GPE out of the ORGANIZATION in February 2017 for $50,000 and has been the prototypical projectable right-hander since. The 6-foot-4, 180-pounder has shown the ability to miss bats every step of the way, spending parts of two summers in the ORGANIZATION, hitting two rookie-level stops in 2018 and in making his full-season debut in 2019. He earned PERSON All-Star honors in the process before hitting a bit of a wall in the second half.Right now, GPE's fastball averages 91-92 mph, though he does throw it well up in the zone with good life and spin rate. With his clean delivery and frame, there's also some more velocity to dream on. His low-80s curveball is his best secondary pitch. It flashes plus, but more than likely will settle into being a consistently above-average breaking ball in the future. GPE will also throw a splitter, which is behind the other two pitches, but could eventually give him a third close-to-average offering.Like with many young pitchers, command is still elusive as he grows into his body and learns to repeat his delivery consistently. There's some ceiling here and if the ORGANIZATION are patient, there's plenty of time for GPE to develop into a Major League starter.",-1
"PERSON originally signed with the ORGANIZATION as a 16-year-old shortstop out of the ORGANIZATION for $150,000 back in October 2015. After debuting in the ORGANIZATION in 2016, he made his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION League the following summer. The ORGANIZATION aggressively jumped him to full-season ball in 2018, with less than optimal results. So in 2019 they sent PERSON back to the LOCATION, where he's shown he's made some adjustments and started tapping into his power while handling multiple infield positions.PERSON's bat is his carrying tool. A switch-hitter, PERSON has shown the ability to impact the baseball on a much more consistent basis from both sides of the plate. It's definitely hit over power right now and while he has been developing some strike zone discipline, he still has much work to do in seeing pitches, drawing walks and cutting down his strikeout rate. If he can do that, he has the chance to continue to show excellent extra-base pop, especially for his position. While he still sees time at shortstop, he's played three infield spots, with second and third base his best defensively.The infielder will have to continue to show he can make adjustments and develop a better overall approach in order to hit enough to tap into that raw power, especially as he moves up the ladder. He likely profiles best as a bat-first utility type, but if it all comes together, seeing him as an offensive-minded second baseman isn't completely out of the question.",-1
"The 2014-15 international signing period has proven to be a solid one in terms of providing prospects for the ORGANIZATION. ORGANIZATION and PERSON were the top two signees bonus-wise, and both are on this Top 30. The recently traded PERSON, who topped the list, was an under-the-radar signing. The ORGANIZATION also got PERSON that November for $75,000, a strong-armed backstop who had a solid full-season debut in 2018.PERSON's catch and throw skills have always stood out. He has a plus arm and good footwork, allowing him to throw out nearly 40 percent of potential basestealers. He has very good hands, but does need to continue to polish his overall receiving skills. PERSON is currently a fringe hitter, but he started tapping into his raw power in GPE, a place not usually conducive to the long ball. It's mostly to the pull side with a short, compact swing from the right side, and he'll have to refine his overall approach in order continue tapping into that power as he moves up the ladder.At the very least PERSON has the makings of a defensive-minded backup with some power at the plate. If he can improve his approach and become a better all-around hitter, he has the chance to be more than that.",-1
"PERSON was pure projection when the ORGANIZATION inked him for $350,000 at the outset of the 2013-14 international period. He spent the next three seasons playing in his native ORGANIZATION League but showed improvement in each campaign before turning in a breakout 2017 campaign with PERSON at age 20.PERSON has impressed club officials with his above-average bat speed and overall feel to hit. He started to grow into his lean, athletic frame in 2017 and in turn saw his power blossom en route to career highs in both doubles and home runs. His swing can get too long at times, however, which leads to some swing-and-miss issues, but also highlights the left-handed hitter's room for improvement.PERSON's athleticism, speed and plus arm strength have netted him time at all three outfield spots, though he spent much of 2017 in center field. He'll need to improve his routes and jumps to remain there, as some evaluators already believe he's best suited for a corner spot long term.",-1
"PERSON jumped onto the prospect radar as a 15-year-old in 2013, when he played the infield for GPE's 18U World Cup team. The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $225,000 the following year and subsequently moved him behind the plate, only to see him blossom into the organization's top catching prospect in the following years. After back-to-back seasons in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON made the jump to the GPE in 2017 and excelled on both sides of the ball in the Rookie-level Appalachian League.PERSON's impact potential with the bat was on full display in the ORGANIZATION, where he finished among the circuit leaders with 74 hits (third), 22 doubles (second), a .332 average (fifth) and a .507 slugging percentage (fifth). PERSON combines strength, bat speed and a smooth right-handed swing to generate hard contact with ease, though his barrel path can get long at times. Those qualities also help him generate above-average raw power that he should tap into more consistently in the coming years. PERSON's progress behind the plate has been even more impressive, especially when considering how new he is to the position. His athleticism and agility aid him as a blocker and a receiver, while his cannon arm and solid catch-and-throw skills enabled him to nab 57 percent of would-be basestealers in 2017. He'll need to become more durable to handle the rigors of a full season, but all the tools and relative skills are there for him to develop into a first-division backstop.",-1
"An infielder on GPE's 18U World Cup squad in 2013, PERSON was moved behind the plate by the Rays the next year after signing for $225,000. He has since blossomed into the organization's top catching prospect, not to mention one of the better young backstops in the Minors, showing tools that give him impact potential on both sides of the ball. He raked in the Rookie-level GPE League during his 2017 stateside debut, finishing fifth on the circuit in both average (.332) and slugging (.507), then boosted his stock in his first full season by clubbing 21 home runs over 109 games at age 20 in the Class A ORGANIZATION in '18.PERSON is a physically strong right-handed hitter who projects to hit for power and average at a premium position. He makes a lot of hard contact, exhibiting bat speed as well as a knack for barreling the baseball with good hand-eye coordination. He's added loft to his swing and began to tap into his plus raw power last season to finish second in home runs among PERSON catchers. That power is almost entirely to PERSON's pull side, however, and some evaluators question his ability to hit to all fields. While he doesn't strike out much, PERSON will need to tone down his aggressive approach and become more selective as he works his way through the Minors. PERSON has the type of plus arm strength and catch-and-throw skills needed to control a running game, but he'll need to make considerable gains with his receiving and blocking to stick behind the plate. Some of those improvements should happen naturally with experience, as PERSON is still new to catching and learning the many nuances of the position. Scouts tend to agree that he could become an average defender, with enough thump at the plate to compensate for any shortcomings behind it.",-1
"PERSON ORGANIZATION may have departed the organization in a controversial trade for PERSON, but the ORGANIZATION still have an ultra-advanced teenaged right-hander from the 2014-15 international class. Signed for $250,000 out of GPE, PERSON paced the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION with a 63/3 K/BB ratio in his 2015 pro debut. He finished fifth in the LOCATION League with a 104/23 ratio last year, when he was the low Class A circuit's youngest ORGANIZATION qualifier at age 18.PERSON can't overpower hitters but succeeds thanks to his ability to locate three pitches and the deception in his delivery. His 88-93 mph four-seam fastball plays above its velocity because he can locate it with precision. His fading changeup improved in 2016 and might represent his best chance for a plus offering, and his curveball has some downer action if not a ton of power behind it.Boston's 2016 Minor League pitcher of the year isn't physical and may be more skinny than projectable, so his floor stands out more than his ceiling. PERSON may not be more than a No. 4 starter, but his uncanny pitchability makes him a good bet to realize that potential. And while the ORGANIZATION will try to watch his workload because he's still so young, he still might reach PERSON at age 21.",-1
"Signed for $250,000 out of GPE in 2014, PERSON made an immediate impression with his advanced pitchability. He led the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION with a 63/3 K/BB ratio in his 2015 pro debut, then ranked fifth in the LOCATION League with a 104/23 mark the following season, when he was the low Class A circuit's youngest pitching qualifier at age 18. The jump to high Class A didn't go as smoothly in 2017, though he fared better there this year before elbow inflammation ended his season in early June.PERSON lacks a plus pitch and wasn't able to baffle high Class A hitters with his command and deception. His best offering is his fading changeup, which helped him hold left-handers to a .668 ORGANIZATION last year. But righties teed off on him to the tune of a 1.033 ORGANIZATION, as his 88-92 mph four-seam fastball, his fringy curveball and new slider weren't able to keep them at bay. PERSON has to be precise with the location of his pitches in order to succeed, and he wasn't as sharp in 2017. His command helps his fastball play above its mediocre velocity but that wasn't enough to keep it off barrels last year. He has a unique windup with a deep knee bend and a twist, though that hasn't thrown hitters off as much in high Class A as it had at lower levels.",-1
"PERSON PERSON wasn't the only Red Sox international signee from 2014 who pitched his way to the GPE sooner than expected. Inked for $250,000 out of GPE, PERSON led the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION with a gaudy 63/3 K/BB ratio in his 2015 pro debut, which he concluded by allowing a total of two runs in four Rookie-level Gulf Coast League starts.PERSON has added about 5 mph to his fastball since signing and now pitches at 89-91 with a max velocity of 93. He should throw harder once he adds some muscle to his skinny frame, and his heater already plays up because of his precocious ability to locate it where he wants. He also has a pair of promising secondary pitches, with his downer curveball presently ranking ahead of his fading changeup.Extremely advanced for an 18-year-old, PERSON has a chance to become a mid-rotation starter. PERSON may keep him in short-season ball this year to avoid piling too many innings on his young arm, but his stuff and feel for pitching could get him to PERSON before he turns 22.",-1
"One of the best defensive players available in the 2015 international crop, PERSON signed for $2 million out of the ORGANIZATION. To put the ORGANIZATION' global spending spree last year in perspective, that was just the seventh-highest bonus paid out by the club.PERSON has all the tools to be a plus shortstop at the big league level. He has nice actions and instincts, a quick first step, plenty of range, soft hands and a strong arm. He might already be the best defensive infielder a system without many strong gloves up the middle.PERSON offers some offensive potential as well. His right-handed swing could use some smoothing out but he shows signs of pitch recognition and plate discipline, which along with his solid speed should help him hit for a decent average. He has a projectable frame and good bat speed, so he could have some pop as well.",-1
"One of the best defenders in the 2015-16 international class, PERSON landed a $2 million bonus to sign out of the ORGANIZATION. He spent his first pro season in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION before making his GPE debut in 2017. That ended in early August when a runner slid into him on an attempted double play and broke his left leg. PERSON healthy in 2018, PERSON showed improved hitting ability as well as some power en route to both mid-season and post-season All-Star honors in the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION acquired him and right-hander PERSON for ORGANIZATION and cash considerations in a January trade. While PERSON still needs time to develop more consistency, he has Gold PERSON upside at shortstop. He covers plenty of ground at shortstop thanks to his smooth actions, quick first step and keen instincts, and his soft hands and strong arm add to his playmaking ability. His tools will play anywhere in the infield and he saw time at second and third base last year.PERSON isn't nearly as advanced offensively as he is defensively. He's a switch-hitter with promising bat speed and solid speed but hit just .232/.324/.362 in his first two pro seasons. He showed some patience in his debut but was overly aggressive last season and struck out in 33 percent of his plate appearances.",-1

His bonus ranked as just the seventh-highest in the ORGANIZATION' global spending spree. He made his pro debut last summer in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION, batting .228/.352/.345 but establishing his credentials as the best middle-infield defender in the system.Though he's years away from the big leagues at this point, it's not difficult to project PERSON as a possible ORGANIZATION. With his quick first step, smooth actions and advanced instincts, he covers plenty of ground at shortstop. Soft hands and a strong arm round out a complete defensive package.Once PERSON gets stronger, he could provide some offense as well.

"Listed at 5-foot-10 and 155 pounds, PERSON had his size work against him when he signed out of the ORGANIZATION in 2017. After commanding just a $10,000 bonus, he opened eyes during his pro debut and instructional league last year. He led the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION in strikeout rate (12.3 per nine innings) and ranked second in K/BB ratio (9.9).While he lacks size, PERSON routinely pumps out 92-96 mph fastballs with sink and he touched 98 mph at age 18. His high-spin curveball combines power with depth and could give him a second plus pitch once it's more consistent. He has little experience using a changeup and his is still too firm. PERSON generates his electric fastball and curveball with a quick arm rather than effort. He easily repeats his compact delivery, allowing him to pound the strike zone.

He was deemed advanced enough to make the jump straight to the GPE for his 2018 professional debut, and he continued to surpass expectations by earning a promotion to the GPE League at age 17 after slashing .279/.307/.421 with 19 extra-base hits in the ORGANIZATION League.A switch-hitting shortstop, PERSON projects better as a left-handed hitter, even though he had more success against southpaws in 2018. He's impressed evaluators with his combination of bat speed and raw power from a swing that works really well and should allow him to hit for both average and power. PERSON's raw pop is already showing, and he's only going to add strength and tap into it more as he matures. His outstanding defensive actions, soft hands and plus arm strength will give him a chance to stick at shortstop, where he stands to offer the most value with his bat. And if his 6-foot-3 frame fills out and he needs to move off the position, PERSON should have the offensive profile to fit at third base.PERSON looks a lot like former big leaguer PERSON in terms of body type, though he profiles as a different type of player.

He has easy actions on defense, showing off soft hands and range in all directions. A steady defender with outstanding instincts, he should be given every opportunity to stick at short. There is the chance he'll outgrow the position, so a move to third could be in his future, and he's athletic enough to potentially handle an outfield corner.A switch-hitter, PERSON is a contact hitter with bat speed and a good feel to hit from both sides.

While teams were wary of his medical history, he's still quick and has the upside of a 20-20 player.Despite his quickness, PERSON is still a work in progress defensively. He played center field for the ORGANIZATION and saw duty at all three outfield spots in his first season in pro ball. He has an average arm and probably fits best in a corner.",-1
"While it surprised some when the ORGANIZATION took PERSON with the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in the 2017 Draft, the toolsy infielder has shown quickly that he was worthy of being taken in the top spot. The GPE high schooler made it to the full-season GPE League in his summer debut, then performed his way up to the ORGANIZATION State League in his first full season. While he may have been fatigued down the stretch, he did homer three times in helping ORGANIZATION Myers win the ORGANIZATION title at the end of the year.A premium athlete, PERSON has impressive tools across the board combined with instincts and makeup that allow them all to play up consistently. He consistently makes hard contact with an advanced approach at the plate, drawing walks while not striking out a ton. He can drive the ball to all fields and his over-the-fence power started showing up, with more to come. His speed should allow him to continue to be a serious basestealing threat. He had a very positive year at shortstop defensively, showing a ton of improvement. There's still room for him to improve the consistency of his throws, but the ORGANIZATION think he could be an above-average defender when all is said and done.PERSON was the youngest player in the ORGANIZATION State League when he got there at age 19, so he's already well ahead of the curve. Seeing him in GPE at age 21, with a future as an All-Star level player, seems completely reasonable.",-1
"The top high school position player in the 2017 GPE class, PERSON spent most of the spring in the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick conversation, though for most of it, he seemed on the outside of it.

He uses his plus athleticism well on both sides of the ball. While he doesn't have the most traditional approach at the plate, he does barrel the ball up consistently. He's hit over power now, but he should grow into more pop as he matures. Even if he never becomes a big home run guy, he should have plenty of extra-base ability, sending line drives into the gaps and then using his plus speed to take extra bags, as well as steal them. That speed gives him good range in the field, both at shortstop and in center field. His arm might be a touch short for the infield position, but he'll be given every opportunity to show he can stay on the dirt.Regardless of where he ends up, PERSON has the potential to be an up-the-middle impact player.

"PERSON ranked as the top high school position player in the 2017 Draft class and often mentioned as a potential top pick, it nonetheless took some by surprise that the ORGANIZATION took PERSON. 1 overall. He signed for $6.725 million, $1 million under pick value, then repaid PERSON's faith in him by performing extremely well in the ORGANIZATION and all the way up in the full-season ORGANIZATION after a late promotion.PERSON has outstanding athleticism on both sides of the ball. When you combine that with his baseball IQ, it's easy to see a future star. At the plate, he barrels the ball up consistently and has extra-base authority to all fields, with more power to come for sure. He showed an advanced approach at the plate with the ability to draw walks, which should give him more opportunities to use his plus speed on the basepaths. There were some questions about whether PERSON would be a shortstop long term, or need to move to center, but he has good range and hands and might have just enough arm to stay on the dirt. The ORGANIZATION plan to keep him there, at least for the time being.PERSON will be an impact up-the-middle player in either case. After his strong pro debut that saw the prepster jump on a slightly faster track by getting his feet wet in GPE, watching his full-season encore should be a treat.",-1
"The highest-priced position player in the ORGANIZATION' 2013 international class, PERSON signed for $600,000 out of the ORGANIZATION. He came to the GPE for his pro debut the following summer and struggled. He nevertheless earned a promotion to low Class A at age 18 this season, and he went 6-for-6 in his first game and emerged as one of PERSON's best prospects.After doing nothing at the plate in 2014, PERSON has surprised the ORGANIZATION' new front-office regime with his pop this season. He's not a big guy, but he's deceptively strong and drives the ball with a quick, compact right-handed swing. He makes repeated hard contact, though he'll need to tighten his strike zone. While PERSON believes PERSON can stay at shortstop, scouts outside the organization aren't as optimistic. He has great hands and solid arm strength, but his quickness and actions are merely average. If he loses even half a step as he fills out, he'll have to slide over to second base.",-1
"PERSON didn't become a full-time starter at ORGANIZATION until last spring, when he shook off flexor inflammation that sidelined him for the first three weeks to become the Pac-12 Conference's pitcher of the year. He ranked second in ORGANIZATION Division I in hit rate (5.0 per nine innings) and ORGANIZATION (0.83) and fourth in GPE (1.44), finishing his college career with a 20-2 record and 2.11 GPE. The ORGANIZATION drafted him in the second round and signed him for $1,469,900.PERSON thrives by commanding and sequencing four pitches. His fastball parks at 90-93 mph and reaches 95, playing better than its velocity because it has a high spin rate and riding life that gets swings and misses up in the strike zone. His best offerings are a mid-80s slider with two-plane break and a changeup with fade, and he also mixes in a usable curveball to give hitters a different look.Though he's small for a starter, PERSON exerts little effort and uses a high-three-quarters delivery to create angle and plane on his pitches. He pounds the strike zone and limits his mistakes. Unlike many of GPE' recent early-round selections, he stands out more for his floor than his ceiling and is a good bet to become a No. 4 starter.",-1
"A known quantity heading into the 2016 Draft as a GPE PERSON catcher, PERSON helped his stock out late by going off offensively during the ORGANIZATION World Series, landing in the eighth round. He continued to show power in his pro debut, hitting 10 homers in the ORGANIZATION League.His pop from the left side of the plate is his best offensive tool and he was able to get to it fairly consistently with PERSON, even hitting four long balls in August as he tired out a bit. There is some swing and miss to his game, striking out in 34 percent of his at-bats during his pro debut. PERSON broke his thumb during his GPE Jac season, so he didn't get to catch down the stretch, but he played regularly behind the plate with PERSON and is eager to show he can stick there. He does have a strong arm, but the rest of his defensive game needs refinement.If he can remain a catcher, PERSON could be, at the very least, a lefty power-hitting backup. He might be athletic enough to handle an outfield corner or a move to first, where his bat could profile well.",-1
"ORGANIZATION hit 26 homers as ORGANIZATION's catcher during his sophomore and junior seasons, leading the ORGANIZATION with 16 in 2018. That led to the Twins taking him in the second round, ahead of where most of the industry had him, thinking those offensive skills would translate. If his pro debut is any indication, the Twins were right as ORGANIZATION dominated the GPE League to earn a promotion to full-season PERSON, where he capped off a successful first summer of pro ball by hitting two postseason homers.A big, strong backstop, ORGANIZATION is definitely a power over hit kind of offensive performer, though his solid approach at the plate allowed him to tap into that power consistently during his debut. If he can continue to manage the strike zone, he could have plus game power when all is said and done. There were questions about ORGANIZATION' ability to stick behind the plate, but the Twins were pleased with his receiving skills and think his blocking will be fine as well, with an arm that plays a tick above average.A physics major at ORGANIZATION, ORGANIZATION gets high marks for his intelligence and his makeup. He might be a backup when all is said and done, but don't be shocked to see him as a power-hitting leader behind the plate on a daily basis in the big leagues.",-1
"PERSON seemed an unlikely candidate for the first round after he logged a 5.84 ERA in his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION, but he was one of the hottest college pitchers down the stretch last spring and became the first Bulldogs pitcher selected that high since PERSON in 2005. He won his final nine starts, as well as the ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year and tournament ORGANIZATION awards, and flirted with a no-hitter in a regional playoff game in his final outing. The GPE selected him 27th overall, signed him for a below-slot $2 million and used the savings to land top prep catching prospect PERSON in the sixth round.Though PERSON wasn't a consensus first-round talent, he did have the best fastball in the 2019 college crop. He has the ability to maintain a 94-96 mph four-seamer into the late innings, topping out at 98 with running action. He also employs a 92-94 mph two-seamer with a lot of sink, and his two heaters play well off each other.PERSON lacked consistency with his secondary pitches in college, but he had more success with an 82-85 mph slider after altering his grip midway through his senior season. GPE believes he can develop a reliably solid slider working in its pitching lab, and also thinks he'll be able to refine a changeup he didn't use much as an amateur. He made strides with his strike-throwing ability in 2019, and the GPE envision him becoming a mid-rotation starter if he can continue to improve.",-1
"A product of the ORGANIZATION prep ranks, ORGANIZATION was committed to GPE before the ORGANIZATION drafted him in the fourth round and signed him for slot value. He showed well in his first full season, tallying 42 extra-base hits and 20 steals at ORGANIZATION A Delmarva, and then broke out in earnest in 2018 with a torrid first half in the ORGANIZATION A Advanced PERSON (.377/.467/.556) before a bump up to Double-A in June. While he didn't fare as well in the LOCATION (.239/.341/.338), ORGANIZATION did get back on track in the ORGANIZATION, finishing fifth in the batting race (.344) and second in GPE (1.064).ORGANIZATION's quick bat and natural feel for finding the barrel helps him make consistent line-drive contact, and he's become increasingly comfortable hitting to all fields as he's faced better pitching. He's also made strides in refining his approach, demonstrating a combination of patience and aggressiveness that fuels his ability to both hit for average and get on base at a solid clip. While ORGANIZATION projects for more gap power than true over-the-fence pop, some evaluators believe he could have seasons with double-digit homers in his prime.ORGANIZATION gets out of the box exceptionally well for a right-handed hitter and routinely posts plus-or-better home-to-first run times. That speed also gives him the chance to stay in center field, and he has more than enough arm strength for the position. Overall, ORGANIZATION has the ceiling of a center fielder who hits at either the top or bottom of the lineup, and his well-rounded game gives him a realistic fourth-outfielder floor.",-1
" The last high schooler from GPE to do anything of note in the pro game was PERSON, now a starter in the ORGANIZATION rotation. He was drafted back in 2006. ORGANIZATION provides the FACILITY's first real hope from the prep ranks since then after signing for full pick value in the fourth round of the 2015 Draft.ORGANIZATION definitely has some tools to help him make an impact. He can really hit, with a line-drive approach and more power to come as he matures. He has very good speed from the right side of the plate and is a threat on the basepaths. That speed gives him the chance to stay in center field and he has more than enough arm for the position. He's strong, stocky and athletic. Patience with high schoolers, especially those from cold-weather areas, is key. But the payoff could be a toolsy center fielder in the future.",-1
"Hailing from GPE PERSON in GPE, N.H., ORGANIZATION didn't receive a lot of GPE exposure until temperatures began to rise in the LOCATION. The ORGANIZATION liked what they saw in ORGANIZATION, ultimately drafting him in the fourth round in 2015 and signing him for full slot value. He had a promising full-season debut in 2017 with PERSON, posting a .712 OPS with 42 extra-base hits and 20 steals, and continued to build on that performance in '18 with a superb first half in the Class A Advanced PERSON -- he ranked among the circuit leaders in most offensive categories -- that earned him his first Double-A promotion in June.ORGANIZATION has good feel to hit, with a line-drive approach that produces quality contact from line to line. He has sneaky pop for his size, too, and some evaluators believe some of ORGANIZATION's doubles will eventually translate to more home runs. His overall approach is solid, albeit with some swing-and-miss tendencies. ORGANIZATION has very good speed from the right side of the plate and is a threat on the basepaths. That speed also gives him the chance to stay in center field, and he has more than enough arm strength for the position. As with many high schoolers from cold-weather states, patience will be key with ORGANIZATION. He's rewarded the ORGANIZATION so far with his improvements in each season, and if all goes as hoped, he could develop into a toolsy, up-the-middle player capable of hitting atop the lineup.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION knew they were getting a potentially special hitter when they selected PERSON with their second of two first round picks in 2015. He's proved to be that early in his career, showing a combination of pure hitting ability and power that earned him a promotion to Double-A at age 20 in 2017 before a successful turn in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's 2018 debut was delayed by a fractured right hand.PERSON boasts a quick bat and does an outstanding job of keeping his hands inside the ball so as to create extension through the zone and generate backspin to all fields. An advanced approach and good pitch recognition further fuel PERSON's projection as an above-average hitter, and scouts are equally high on his power potential after he piled up 67 extra-base hits, including 18 home runs and a Minor League-best 48 doubles, in his second full season.The move up to Double-A brought a position change for PERSON as the ORGANIZATION shifted from shortstop to third base. He showed in the ORGANIZATION that his below-average arm strength plays better at the hot corner than it did at short, though some scouts believe he'll ultimately end up further down the defensive spectrum. Regardless of his position, it will be PERSON's bat that helps him carve out a career as an impactful regular.",-1
" After taking pitchers with their first pick in four straight Drafts, the ORGANIZATION' approach shifted in 2015 as they selected college outfielder D.J. PERSON (ORGANIZATION. 25 overall) and GPE (ORGANIZATION. 36) at the back end of the first round. It hasn't taken the latter long to establish himself as the gem of that PERSON class, as he's already reached Double-A at age 20 in his second full season after raking his way through the LOCATION and GPE leagues.  GPE is a pure right-handed hitter. His loose swing can get too one-dimensional at times, leading to some swing-and-miss, but he does a good job of adjusting his hands and barrel so as to make consistent contact, all the while demonstrating feel for using the whole field. His bat speed is plus and leads to a lot of hard contact, and he's shown the ability to consistently tap into his above-average raw power against advanced pitching. He's a good athlete with average speed that aids him on both sides of the ball. The ORGANIZATION remain steadfast in their development of GPE as a shortstop, although few in the industry believe he can remain there on account of his well-below-average arm, with left field representing his likely long-term home. Regardless, GPE has proved capable of offsetting those defensive concerns with his impressive combination of hitting ability and power.",-1
"GPE was revered by scouts for his potential with the bat as a GPE high schooler before the ORGANIZATION nabbed him with the second of their two first-round picks in 2015. That hitting ability has helped him move quickly through the ORGANIZATION despite concerns about his defense, as GPE raked his way up to Double-A at age 20 in '17. And even though the start of GPE's '18 campaign was delayed due to a fractured right wrist suffered during Spring Training, he still put up strong numbers in the LOCATION and represented the ORGANIZATION at the ORGANIZATION in July. GPE just knows how to impact the baseball. He has a quick bat and does an outstanding job of keeping his hands inside the ball to create extension through the zone and generate backspin carry to all fields. It gives him a chance to be at least an above-average hitter with similar power potential, especially if he can further refine his approach.While the move up to Double-A brought a position change from shortstop to third base for GPE, his below-average arm strength and fringy range made him unlikely to stay there long term. Sure enough, the ORGANIZATION began working him in at first base during Spring Training before deploying him primarily at the position at the outset of 2019. He's always had good hands on the left side of the infield that should serve him well as a first baseman, and he certainly has the hitting ability and power to profile there at the highest level .",-1
" An GPE area high school infielder who played not far from 2015 top high school prospect PERSON, GPE showed the ORGANIZATION enough for them to think he was worthy of being taken with the last pick of the first round. He signed for $1.3 million, below pick value , and debuted in the ORGANIZATION League.GPE stands out most for his hitting ability. His tremendous bat speed leads to elite exit velocity when he squares balls up, giving him above-average power. He has a loose swing and does a good job of making adjustments to make consistent contact. Defensively, GPE isn't as advanced. A shortstop in high school, he saw plenty of action at third base on the showcase circuit. While he played a good amount of shortstop during his pro debut, most feel he'll likely either end up at third base or in the outfield at the next level.",-1
"An GPE area high school infielder who played not far from 2015 top high school prospect PERSON, GPE showed the ORGANIZATION enough for them to think he was worthy of being taken with the last pick of the first round. After signing for below slot value at $1.3 million, GPE played well enough in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League to earn a late-season promotion to ORGANIZATION A Short PERSON, and then began his first full professional season at ORGANIZATION A Delmarva.GPE stands out most for his hitting ability. A right-handed hitter, he has a loose swing that can get too one-dimensional at times, leading to some swing-and-miss, but he does a good job of making adjustments to make consistent contact and already demonstrates feel for using the whole field. His bat speed generates impressive exit velocity when he barrels the ball, and scouts believe his above-average raw power eventually will translate to average pop in games.Tall and athletic, GPE has average speed that aids him on both sides of the ball. The ORGANIZATION intend to develop him as a shortstop, and he spent most of his pro debut at the position. However, with limited range and below-average arm strength, some scouts believe he'll ultimately end up in the outfield.",-1
"GPE spent his entire college career in GPE's weekend rotation, setting Bulldogs records for strikeouts in a season (126) and a career (306) as a junior in 2019. He also ranked third in ORGANIZATION Division I in whiff rate (14.5 per nine innings) en route to signing with the ORGANIZATION for $547,500 as a third-round choice. That made him the highest pick in school history, surpassing two-time All-Star Pat Neshek, a Twins sixth-rounder in 2002.GPE had perhaps the best changeup in the 2019 Draft, a low-80s offering with fade that he sells with deceptive arm speed. He sets it up with a 91-94 mph fastball that peaks at 96 with riding life. Both his curveball and slider can be solid pitches at their best but they lack consistency.His strong 6-foot-3 frame should give GPE the durability necessary to remain a starter. He has some crossfire action in his three-quarters delivery that makes it tough to pick up his pitches but also hampers his ability to command them. His stuff ticked up a notch during his pro debut, so he may have a higher ceiling than GPE initially imagined.",-1
"After taking PERSON as a GPE-eligible sophomore out of ORGANIZATION. 22 overall in the 2018 GPE, making him the second first-round pick out of the school after fellow left-hander PERSON, the ORGANIZATION have now taken a college lefty in the first round three times in the past eight drafts. The previous two, PERSON in 2014 and PERSON in 2011, were both in the big league rotation in 2018. They're hopeful that PERSON's polish and feel for pitching will allow him to join them sooner rather than later.PERSON is the epitome of an advanced college lefty, one who should be able to use his four-pitch mix and outstanding feel for pitching. His best pitch is his plus curveball, a power breaking ball with depth that was one of the best breaking balls in his GPE class. He's able to manipulate it and turn it into a solid slider as well, and he has a fading changeup that he didn't use much last year but has shown a solid feel for in the past. All of those offerings support his 91-93 mph fastball that he commands extremely well. There might be a tick or two of velocity coming as he matures.Not likely to be a huge strikeout guy, though that curve can miss bats, PERSON goes right after hitters, filling up the strike zone. His goal is early contact, changing speeds and quadrants to get weak contact. His savvy plus his stuff could have him progress rapidly through the ORGANIZATION system.",-1
"One of the more polished prep left-handers in the 2016 GPE, PERSON lasted until the ORGANIZATION took him in the 37th round because he was strongly committed to GPE. He emerged as the ORGANIZATION' best pitcher midway through his freshman season and continued to shine during the ORGANIZATION last summer and again as a GPE-eligible sophomore this spring. He joined PERSON as the lone first-rounders in school history, signing for $2,912,300 as the 22nd overall choice.PERSON had one of the best curveballs in the GPE, a power breaker with depth that qualifies as a well-above-average offering at its best. He sets it up by throwing his 91-93 mph fastball to both sides of the plate, and he can turn his curve into a harder slider with some tilt. He showed a solid fading changeup on the Cape but got away from throwing it during the spring.With a strong, athletic build and an easy delivery, PERSON is well equipped to remain a starter. His stuff improved during each of his two years in college and may continue to get better. His control was inconsistent at times as a sophomore, but he has a history of throwing strikes.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION didn't pick for the first time until No. 48 overall in the second round of the 2017 Draft, courtesy of signing free agent PERSON, but they feel they got a first-round talent in PERSON, an GPE high school infielder who signed for full pick value rather than join his father, an assistant coach at ORGANIZATION. After a strong summer debut, PERSON really struggled out of the gate during his full-season debut in 2018, but righted the ship with a .310/.370/.419 second half.PERSON's ability to shake off a terrible start in the LOCATION League as a teenager speaks volumes about his ability to learn and make adjustments as a hitter. He has a tremendous feel to hit with excellent bat speed and a quick swing from the right side of the plate. There's a lot of raw power to tap into, with the chance for PERSON to eventually have plus pop that he'll get to thanks to his approach. While few doubt he'll hit, there is more question about what position he ultimately plays. The ORGANIZATION like moving infielders around during development, doing it with top prospect PERSON, for example, and PERSON will do the same moving forward after only playing shortstop in his first year-plus as a pro.PERSON will have the opportunity to stay at shortstop, but given that he's already bigger and stronger than he was when last season ended, it's easy to see him outgrowing the position. He could slide over to third or across to second full-time in the future. One thing the ORGANIZATION love about positional flexibility is that it will be easier to get PERSON's potent bat into a big league lineup once he's ready.",-1
" The ORGANIZATION didn't have a first-round choice in the 2017 Draft after signing PERSON as a free agent but were thrilled to find PERSON in the second round. He had a history of success as an amateur, including winning the home run derby at the Under PERSON All-America Game in 2016 and starring for the GPE 18-and-under team that won a gold medal at the ORGANIZATION Games later that year. He signed for $1,425,400, turning down the chance to play at ORGANIZATION, where his father PERSON is an assistant coach.PERSON grew up around the game and gets universal praise for his makeup and instincts, and he also has a chance to be a dynamic offensive performer. He has a quick right-handed swing that already produces pull power and should deliver home runs to all fields once he gets stronger. He has shown the ability to make adjustments at the plate and his patience was obvious when he walked 27 times in a 33-game pro debut shortened by a lower back injury.Most amateur scouts projected that PERSON will outgrow shortstop, though he looked a little better than expected in his debut. He's an average runner who may slow a bit as he fills out and doesn't have the quickest first step, but his instincts and strong arm help him make plays. PERSON plans on trying him at third base and he also could fit at second base or in the outfield, but there are no immediate plans to move him off shortstop.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their top pick (second round) in the 2017 Draft and the first ORGANIZATION high schooler selected that high since the ORGANIZATION picked PERSON in the first round a decade earlier. The ORGANIZATION. 3 hitter and one of the top performers on the GPE national 18-and-under squad that won the gold medal at the 2016 Pan ORGANIZATION Championships, PERSON was PERSON's ORGANIZATION player of the year in 2017. The son of ORGANIZATION State assistant coach PERSON, he turned down the chance to play for the ORGANIZATION and signed for $1,425,400 as the 48th overall selection.The winner of the home run derby at the 2016 Under PERSON All-America Game, PERSON has a quick right-handed bat, impressive power to his pull side and more projectable pop once he gets stronger. His swing got long at times during the early portion of the high school showcase circuit last summer, but he showed the ability to make adjustments and carried them into this spring. He has the upside of a .270 hitter with 20 homers per season.Though most scouts believe PERSON lacks the quick-twitch athleticism to stay at shortstop, PERSON let him break into pro ball at that position.

He became the first ORGANIZATION of GPE pitcher to record consecutive triple-digit strikeout seasons in 2018-19, and his scouting reports read similar at the end of his college career as they did at the start. The ORGANIZATION signed him for $500,000 as a third-rounder in June.PERSON has a big arm but lacks consistency, working with a 93-96 mph fastball as a starter and reaching 98 at times but also sitting at 90-93 mph in some outings. His heater lacks life even though he works from a low-three-quarters arm slot, an angle that also makes it tough to stay on top of his slider. It ranges from 80-87 mph and from a below-average slurve to a plus offering with hard bite, and there are days when his changeup grades as his best secondary pitch.Though PERSON is athletic he tends to get under the ball, which detracts from the quality and control of his pitches. He enjoys his most success when he can maintain a more traditional three-quarters slot but has trouble doing so.

He turned down the opportunity to stay in his home state and play for ORGANIZATION, instead signing for a well over-slot $997,500 bonus from the ORGANIZATION as a third-rounder.GPE has plenty of bat speed and strength, giving him well above-average raw power from the right side of the plate. He made more consistent contact as a high school senior than he had previously, though swing-and-miss concerns resurfaced when he got off to a rough start in pro ball. If he can hit well enough to fully tap into his power potential, he could produce 25-30 homers per season.More than just a slugger, GPE displays average speed out of batter's box and is quicker once he gets going.

He has a decent understanding of the strike zone but can lapse into selling out for home runs instead of letting them come naturally. When he did make contact in his first taste of pro ball, much of it came on rolled-over grounders to the left side of the infield.More than a one-dimensional slugger, GPE shows average speed out of the batter's box and is a solid runner once underway.

"After two years as an infielder and reliever at GPE, PERSON opened a lot of eyes when he focused on pitching only in the ORGANIZATION last summer. Initially given the chance to start as a junior, PERSON moved back to the bullpen largely to help the ORGANIZATION' pitching staff. His premium power stuff was as good as ever, and he finished fourth in ORGANIZATION Division I with an average of 14.4 strikeouts-per-nine. PERSON's athleticism that made him an infielder plays well on the mound, and he has long levers and a loose quick arm. He was touching the upper 90s at times over the summer and up to 99 mph more consistently during spring. His power breaking ball buckles knees and could give him a nasty two plus pitch combination in shorter stints, though he does have a changeup that he can use at times against left-handed hitters. While he has missed a ton of bats and continued to be tough to hit, command is still an issue, though his athleticism should allow him to find the strike zone more consistently the more he focuses on pitching.PERSON has the stuff to start, and the D-backs will develop him as such, though most scouts see him as a reliever long-term. The good news is that his fastball-breaking ball combination could allow him to make a beeline to the big leagues out of the bullpen.",-1

The ORGANIZATION obviously won't rush the process, but they are eager to see how PERSON's stuff plays, especially because he's filled out his 6-foot-4 frame and is more man than kid now. During that senior year, PERSON's fastball sat in the 93-97 mph range and there's no reason to believe he can't get back to that, if not beyond that once he gets going, and he pairs it well with his fading changeup. His slider would flash plus before the injury, but it was inconsistent, so that will likely be an area of focus, and he always was able to fill up the strike zone with all three pitches.If all goes well, PERSON will get some mound time at the end of the summer in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION.

He spent his first two pro seasons close to home while repeating the Rookie-level PERSON, batting .330 in his debut and tying for the home run lead with nine in 2017. He has made good progress defensively as well and could wind up as the best all-around performer among GPE' stockpile of catching prospects.PERSON employed a more discipline, contact-oriented approach in his first year as a pro before becoming more aggressive and homer-conscious in his second. The strength and leverage he derives from his extra-large frame give him plenty of natural power, so he shouldn't have to sell out for home runs. There may be a happy medium where he hits .260 with 15-20 homers per year.Though at 6-foot-4 he's bigger than desired for a catcher and he's still a work in progress defensively, he has the tools to get the job done defensively. While he needs to clean up his receiving, he's flexible for his size and scores well in GPE' framing metrics. He possesses solid arm strength but won't get the most out of it until he quickens his release.",-1
"PERSON topped PERSON high schoolers with 14 home runs in 2016 and was the first selected in that PERSON, giving up a commitment to GPE Canyon to sign for $225,000 in the seventh round. He repeated PERSON ball in his first two pro seasons before making the jump to full-season ball in 2018 and ranking seventh among PERSON catchers with 18 homers.

His ultra-aggressive approach yields lots of strikeouts and few walks, however, and may not work against more advanced pitching. Surprisingly athletic for such a big catcher, he has below-average speed and moves well on the bases.Though PERSON pushes the upper limits for size at his position and must continue to improve, the ORGANIZATION are pleased with his progress. His receiving is still rough at times but he scores very well in their framing metrics and has plus arm strength. If he reaches his ceiling, he'll produce 30 homers on an annual basis while providing solid defense behind the plate.",-1
"Developing catchers, especially those taken out of high school, can be a difficult task. But ORGANIZATION's all-around skills in GPE caught the eyes of many scouts this past spring. The ORGANIZATION took him in the fifth round and went well-above-pick value to sign him away from becoming a ORGANIZATION for $1 million.ORGANIZATION doesn't wow with any individual plus tool, but the sum of his parts make him a good prospect. He makes consistent hard contact from the right side of the plate and there should be more power to come as he physically matures. A capable defender with average receiving skills, ORGANIZATION had been inconsistent with this throwing, but turned out to be playing with some minor arm problems. When healthy, he does have above-average arm strength.Patience is often the key with young catchers as the learning curve on both sides of the ball can be steep for backstops. The ORGANIZATION clearly thought he's worth the time and financial investment, giving him second-round money and sending him out to the ORGANIZATION to start his pro career.",-1
"A 10th-round Draft pick by the Indians out of the GPE prep ranks in 2016, GPE, who signed for $125,000, showed advanced hitting ability during his pro debut and continued to do so the following year in the Class A Short-Season New York-Penn League, where he owned a .300/.328/.467 slash line when the ORGANIZATION dealt him and lefty PERSON to GPE for reliever PERSON at the July Trade Deadline. Advancing to full-season ball in 2018, GPE impressed his new organization with his blend of power and speed as he totaled 48 extra-base hits and 44 steals over 121 games in the ORGANIZATION.GPE's wiry frame is loaded with quick-twitch athleticism. It translates to good bat speed and better-than-expected power at the plate, with GPE showing he can consistently impact the baseball. Those qualities, along with his feel for controlling the zone, give him a chance to be at least an average hitter, with power that should play in games more often as he becomes more physical and improves his pitch recognition and selectivity. A plus runner, GPE's 44 steals in 2018 were good for a share of third place in the ORGANIZATION, but he will need to improve his reads and jumps after he was thrown out 16 times, the second-highest total in the circuit. GPE's athleticism shows at second base, where he profiles as an average defender. He has good range, quick feet and above-average arm strength. There's first-division regular upside if it all clicks for GPE, and he also has a fairly high floor with his blend of hitting ability, patience and speed at an up-the-middle position.",-1
"A year after PERSON was an interesting GPE high school prospect who signed an over-pick-value deal with the ORGANIZATION as a fourth-round selection, younger brother PERSON followed on the same path. Much like his older brother, the younger PERSON opened some eyes at summer showcase events and into his senior season, enough for the ORGANIZATION to nab him 37th overall and sign him for a slightly over-slot deal of $2.1 million to keep him from attending Duke.PERSON's standout tool is his left-handed bat. The outfielder has an outstanding and smooth swing and showed the ability to make consistent contact against some of the better prep arms in the country. He's hit over power with a good approach at the plate, but some might be light on his power because of his smallish frame. PERSON does get into trouble at times chasing first pitches out of the zone. He might not be the plus defender his brother is, but he could be a capable left fielder with a solid average arm, and he did get to play some center field during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION. Those who dream on him see a little PERSON, who didn't blossom until his sophomore year of college. So some patience might be in order as the ORGANIZATION help PERSON develop.",-1
"GPE received the largest bonus paid in the ORGANIZATION' 2014 international class, signing for $500,000 out of the ORGANIZATION. A banner GPE debut in 2016 led PERSON to promote him to low Class A at age 19, and a strong finish there got him pushed to high Class A at age 20 last season. He posted the second-worst ORGANIZATION (.585) and walk rate (6 percent) in the GPE League in 2018, signs that he was in over his head, but he also was dealing with a medical issue and has looked better this season now that it has been resolved.GPE has some of the better bat-to-ball skills in the system, but his overly aggressive approach leads to too much weak contact and too few walks. He won't find success at the plate until he starts to work counts and find pitches to drive rather than trying to avoid hitting with two strikes. He shows raw power in batting practice and could have close to average pop if he starts turning his right-handed swing loose more often in game action.An intelligent player with strong makeup, GPE is capable of making adjustments at the plate. Despite fringy speed, he gets good jumps and covers ground in right field. He has a strong arm but needs more defensive consistency after totaling 19 errors in his first two years in full-season ball.",-1
"GPE's $500,000 bonus was the largest the ORGANIZATION paid out during the 2014-15 international signing period. The ORGANIZATION opened eyes by batting .340/.364/.522 in the Rookie-level PERSON during his 2016 GPE debut, then skipped a level to low Class A at age 19 last year. Though GPE ORGANIZATION pitchers took advantage of his ultra-aggressive approach, he rallied to hit .352/.366/.535 in the final six weeks.GPE has a feel for hitting well beyond his years, showing the ability to repeatedly barrel balls and make adjustments. He almost puts the bat on the ball too easily, walking in just 3 percent of his plate appearances during his first three pro seasons, and will do more damage once he learns to work counts and not worry about hitting with two strikes. While his hitting ability has more upside than his power, he already shows the potential for average pop and might have more if he turns his right-handed swing loose more often during games.His instincts extend to defense as well. PERSON has fringy speed, he gets good jumps in right field and has a strong, accurate arm. He also gets high marks for his makeup, impressing with his enthusiasm and his desire to learn GPE quickly.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION gave GPE the biggest bonus in their 2014-15 international pool, signing him for $500,000 out of the ORGANIZATION. He broke into pro ball with a respectable performance in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION in 2015, then opened eyes when he came to the GPE last year. He ranked second in GPE (35), third in slugging (.522) and fourth in batting (.340) in the Rookie-level PERSON's still early because GPE is just getting started, but he could wind up hitting for the best combination of average and power among ORGANIZATION farmhands. He has feel for hitting and making adjustments well beyond his years, and while he uses a more compact right-handed swing during games, his batting-practice displays hint at average or better pop. His biggest need at this point is to be more patient and work deeper counts to get better pitches to punish, as low Class A pitchers have exploited his aggressiveness this year.Though GPE is just a fringy runner, his instincts help him play above his speed in the outfield. He gets good jumps in right field and has an accurate arm whose strength draws grades ranging from average to plus. PERSON also loves his makeup, praising his enthusiasm and desire to learn GPE quickly.",-1
"Ranked No. 16 on ORGANIZATION's list of the Top 30 international prospects for the 2018-19 period, PERSON showed some of the best pure velocity in his class at age 16, before signing with PERSON for $2.6 million in November. Despite PERSON's big arm, questions remain as to whether the GPE product will throw enough strikes as a professional to develop into a starting pitcher.PERSON is an especially hard thrower, with a fastball that has been clocked at 97 mph and sits at 94-95. He has present physical strength and should add even more as he grows into his projectable frame. In terms of secondary pitches, the belief is that those will develop now that PERSON's signed with a team and set to receive daily instruction in an academy. PERSON's velocity is rare in any market and not surprisingly, some scouts wonder if he will be able to command the high velocity on a consistent basis. The skill, however, is extraordinary and offers a foundation for future development.",-1
"There has been a decent amount of pitching from GPE to impact the big leagues in recent years, with PERSON and PERSON the biggest examples. While he is still very far away, the ORGANIZATION did give PERSON $150,000 in July 2016 in the hopes he could eventually join his fellow countrymen at the highest level. The right-hander made his GPE debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League in 2018, and though he was slowed by an elbow tweak, he's gotten a clean bill of health this offseason.The ORGANIZATION love PERSON's size and power stuff. He's already gained some velocity in his time in the organization, cranking his fastball up to 96 mph, and there's clearly more in the tank as he adds strength to his 6-foot-5 frame. He can also really spin his breaking ball, with a power curve that could eventually be better than average. His changeup remains a work in progress. There is also much work to be done in terms of his command if he wants to have any chance to start, though his strike-throwing improved from his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2017 and his move to the U.S. The ORGANIZATION will let him start for the time being, but seeing him approach triple digits coming out of the bullpen could be fun to watch eventually.",-1
"When the ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $150,000 in July 2016 out of GPE, they knew he would likely be a long-term project. But his size and arm strength were enough to entice them to sign him, and he showed signs of what he can become during his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2018.PERSON has already gained some ticks on his fastball since signing, and the 6-foot-5 right-hander has been up to 96 mph this year. There could be more in the tank as he continues to fill out his big frame. PERSON has a good feel to spin his curveball and his changeup continues to develop. The teenager still has work to do with his overall command, but he did cut his walk rate down in the ORGANIZATION in 2018 compared to his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION League a year prior. It might take some time, but the ORGANIZATION love PERSON's raw ingredients.",-1
"A product of GPE's ORGANIZATION, PERSON made himself known to scouts with his cannon arm and athleticism behind the plate. That, along with his potential to hit for power, earned him an above-slot bonus of $450,000 from the A's in 2017 after they drafted him in the fifth round.PERSON's defense is his calling card. He moves much better than his stocky frame suggests, with plenty of agility and lateral quickness that aids him as a blocker. But it's his well-above-average arm strength that draws the most raves, and scouts regarded it to be among the best in the class at the position. Offensively, PERSON offers raw power from the right side of the plate, albeit with an overly aggressive approach that he'll need to tone down in order to hit for average in the professional ranks.Viewed as somewhat as a lottery ticket due to his impressive tools but overall rawness, PERSON has the ingredients to develop into a glove-first catcher at the highest level, though not without first making considerable gains on both sides of the ball.",-1
"After tying PERSON's freshman record with eight saves in 2016, PERSON moved into the rotation as a sophomore and won LOCATION Pitcher of the Year honors.

His fastball velocity has increased from the high 80s as a high school senior to the low 90s in college, and he touched 96 mph during fall practice heading into 2018. PERSON also exhibits feel for a changeup and will mix in a slider/cutter to show hitters something different.PERSON has outstanding body control for such a tall pitcher, which enables him to repeat his delivery and throw all four of his offerings for strikes. He's not overpowering, but his size creates unusual plane and angle that make his pitches more difficult to hit. PERSON's stuff has improved as he has added strength, and there's still room for more muscle on his lanky frame.",-1

PERSON on tight pitch counts after signing for $1.5 million as a second-rounder, he could advance quickly once the ORGANIZATION turn him ORGANIZATION doesn't fit the protoype of a tall pitcher because his polish stands out much more than his power.

He has outstanding body control for someone his size, allowing him to repeat his delivery with ease and throw strikes with all of his offerings.PERSON's best pitch is his low-80s knuckle-curve, which earns plus grades from some evaluators. He also uses a cutter/slider to give him a harder breaking ball and shows feel for a changeup. While he still could add some strength to his lanky frame, his floor stands out more than his ceiling and he's likely to settle in as a No. 4 starter.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION went for sheer upside with the selection of ORGANIZATION in the fourth round out of ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, GPE) High. At 6-foot-7, 205 pounds, he attracted as much if not more interest as a right-handed pitcher than he did as an outfielder. However, ORGANIZATION' raw power from the left side of the plate was too good to pass up and intrigued GPE enough to give him an above-slot bonus of $600,000 as its fourth-round pick.ORGANIZATION' size and physicality gives him big-time power potential, as he's already capable of hitting tape-measure home runs. But as is the case with many young hitters similar in size, his swing has considerable length and will need to be cleaned up as he develops. ORGANIZATION is athletic for his size and moves well in the outfield, while his plus arm that produced low-90s fastball off the mound in high school is a clean fit in right field. ORGANIZATION draws physical comparisons to GPE slugger PERSON based on his size, and the ORGANIZATION hope that the teenager can develop into a similar offensive force. Should things not work out for ORGANIZATION as a position player, his size and potentially power arm give the organization an interesting fallback option.",-1

He has developed slowly, repeating PERSON ball and not making his full-season debut until 2019, but he started to take off when his control began to improve this June.PERSON's best pitch is his curveball, which he commands better than his fastball and sits in the upper 70s with 12-to-6 break. His quick arm produces low-90s heaters that top out at 96 with running action. He has improved his changeup since turning pro, giving him the makings of an average third pitch.He elicits comparisons to a young PERSON, who also had trouble locating his pitches early in his pro career. PERSON is athletic and started throwing more strikes once he developed a more consistent tempo with his delivery. He throws with effort and still has to prove he can repeat his mechanics over a full season, but he's young and PERSON will give him plenty of time to develop as a starter.",-1
"PERSON didn't log a lot of time on the mound as a Utah prepster because he divided his time between two sports as an all-state safety and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee playing football in the fall of 2015, costing him most of his junior baseball season.

PERSON's 2017 Utah player of the year, he had committed to GPE Young.When he's at his best, PERSON will flash a plus fastball and curveball and look like a young PERSON. He usually operates at 90-92 mph with some armside run on his heater, but he already has reached 96 mph and should have more consistent velocity as he gets stronger. He locates his upper-70s curveball better than his fastball but sometimes struggles to get ahead in the count to set up his breaking ball.PERSON sells his changeup with deceptive arm speed, giving him the potential for an average third offering.

He actually commands his upper-70s curve better than his heater but currently struggles to get ahead in the count to set up his breaker.Though his changeup is in its nascent stages, PERSON maintains his arm speed when he throws it. Learning to locate his fastball is No. 1 on his to-do list, and while he has the athleticism to make it happen, he also has a lot of effort in his delivery. He could wind up as a reliever in the long run but PERSON will give him plenty of time to make it as a starter.",-1
"PERSON spent his first two college seasons at GSP (N.C.) JC as a light-hitting shortstop and worked just six innings on the mound as a sophomore. After transferring to GPE, he showcased two potential plus pitches and what one scouting director called the best delivery in the 2019 Draft. PERSON's power stuff, along with the limited mileage on his right arm, put him firmly on the ORGANIZATION' radar, and they made him the highest-drafted player in GPE history -- surpassing PERSON, who went 44th overall in 1986 -- by taking him with the ORGANIZATION. 40 overall pick.PERSON has an effortless arm action and delivery, looking very natural on the mound despite his inexperience. The ball comes out of his hand very easily, with his fastball topping out at 98 mph and usually ranging from 91-95. His slider is his best secondary offering, a plus pitch in the mid 80s at its best but also still inconsistent.As would be expected for a newcomer to the mound, PERSON still needs polish. His loopy curveball and his changeup are less reliable than his slider but can become at least average pitches with more experience. He didn't dominate against so-so competition in the Big GPE, in part because his control and command need work, but he has the athleticism to make the needed adjustments.",-1
"Ranked in the top half of ORGANIZATION's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list as the 2015-16 international signing period opened, PERSON, his tools and his projectable body received $2.25 million to sign that July. He immediately showed his prodigious power, along with a penchant for striking out, during his GPE debut in '16. Both were on display in his '18 full-season debut as he hit 31 homers and struck out 131 times just 94 games. His season was cut short by a freakish thumb injury, but not before he showed off his pop with an opposite-field blast in the ORGANIZATION. He was struggling with the move to the ORGANIZATION in 2019 when the injury bug hit again, this time a fractured hand keeping him out of the lineup for over a month.PERSON has as much raw power as just about anybody in GPE League baseball, with some evaluators saying putting an 80 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale on it would not be outlandish. The big question is whether he can make enough contact to continue to get to that power in games. When he's going well, PERSON lays off breaking balls early in count, but he has a very high chase rate out of the strike zone early in at-bats. There's always going to be some swing and miss to his game, but even some modest improvement in his approach should allow him to be a middle-of-the-order run producer.Blessed with one of the strongest arms in the system, PERSON has the chance to truly fit the right-field profile in the future. Moving to more pitching-friendly parks and facing more advanced pitching should provide a good challenge for the 20-year-old.",-1
"PERSON had some of the best all-around tools in the 2015 international signing class, earning him a $2.25 million bonus out of the ORGANIZATION. As a possible center fielder with electric bat speed and arm strength, he has one of the highest ceilings among Royals prospects. Even before PERSON made his pro debut, some club officials said that he might have the quickest bat in the system. He can absolutely crush balls in batting practice, though some scouts wonder how his aggressive approach will translate in pro ball.PERSON has solid athleticism and speed, giving him a chance to stay in center. If he loses a step as he matures physically, his cannon arm will allow him to transition to right field. If he approaches his offensive potential, he'll have no trouble profiling offensively in right field as well.",-1
"A Dominican with one of the best all-around toolsets available during the 2015-16 international signing period, PERSON turned pro for $2,250,000. He led the ORGANIZATION with eight homers in his 2016 pro debut as one of three 17-year-old regulars in the Rookie-level circuit. He continued to hit for power as one of the youngest players in his league (the Rookie-level Appalachian) last year and will make the jump to full-season ball at age 19 in 2018.Though PERSON and PERSON are more refined, PERSON has the highest ceiling among GPE prospects as well as the most raw power and the strongest arm. With his electric bat speed, strength and leverage in his right-handed swing, he hits tape-measure home runs and can smack opposite-field blasts without squaring the ball up. He'll need to modify his approach and improve his pitch recognition after striking out in 34 percent of his plate appearances in his first two pro seasons.PERSON has solid speed, but has yet to turn it loose much on the bases. After spending part of his debut in center field, he moved to right field in 2017 and has the tools to be an asset there, starting with a bazooka arm. With his combination of tools and physical presence, he draws comparisons to PERSON and PERSON.",-1
"One of the toolsiest players available during the 2015-16 international period, PERSON signed for $2.25 million out of the ORGANIZATION. He spent most of his 2016 pro debut in the Rookie-level PERSON, where he was one of a handful of 17-year-old regulars and tied for the lead with eight homers. Though he also topped the ORGANIZATION with 73 strikeouts, he cut his whiff rate and improved his batting average in each of his three months there.PERSON might have the most raw power in the ORGANIZATION' system. He's so strong and his right-handed swing is so quick and has so much leverage that he can crush 450-foot homers and even drive the ball out of the park to the opposite field without fully squaring it up. His approach is extremely aggressive and he'll need to improve his pitch recognition, though he shows some willingness to accept walks when pitchers won't challenge him. Already a physical presence at such a young age, PERSON draws comparisons to PERSON and PERSON from club officials. He's an average runner out of the batter's box but quicker underway, which gives him enough range to play center field for now. He's likely to wind up in right field, where his cannon arm will fit nicely.",-1
"PERSON was a two-way standout at ORGANIZATION (GPE) High, though it was the promise he showed on the mound that led some teams to peg him as a potential top-10 pick in 2017. The ORGANIZATION nabbed the ORGANIZATION commit at ORGANIZATION. 12, gave him $4.1 million, a bit over-pick value, then sent him to the ORGANIZATION for his pro debut. He was pitching well in the ORGANIZATION when the ORGANIZATION sent him to the ORGANIZATION in August 2018 as the player to be named in the ORGANIZATION trade.With his high-octane arsenal and remaining physical projection, PERSON is the definition of a high-ceiling pitching prospect. Having scrapped his two-seam fastball in favor of a four-seamer, PERSON consistently sits in the mid-90s and can reach back for triple digits, throwing his heater with late, riding life. He previously threw both a curveball and slider that often bled together, but now utilizes only the slider -- a plus offering that registers in the mid-to-upper 80s with devastating action that helps him miss bats. His changeup gives him another potential Major League-average pitch.While he has some violence in his delivery, PERSON has the athleticism and clean arm action needed to make significant gains with his control and command. PERSON will be key for PERSON, and he's in good hands in a ORGANIZATION organization that has a strong record of developing projectable young arms, with 2018 ORGANIZATION Young winner PERSON representing their latest success story.",-1
"A talented two-way player from the GPE high school ranks who competed in showcase home run derbies, it was PERSON's right arm teams coveted in the first round of the 2017 Draft, with his name popping up in top 10 conversations. The ORGANIZATION gave him $4.1 million, a touch over pick value, to sign him away from ORGANIZATION, allowing him to join fellow ORGANIZATION product Ke'Bryan Hayes in the system.PERSON had perhaps the deepest arsenal among high school pitchers in the 2017 Draft class. His fastball kicked up a notch to 92-96 mph with a peak of 98 this spring, and he has shown the ability to run and sink it while maintaining its velocity throughout a game. His 84-88 mph cutter generates a lot of swings and misses, and he also can turn the cutter into more of a true slider, spin a curveball that's a distinctly different pitch and unveil a changeup that could develop into a solid offering.PERSON's athleticism and clean delivery should yield consistent strikes, though he ran into control issues when he fell in love with his secondary pitches and didn't work off his fastball enough. Scouts rave about his makeup as well as his stuff and physicality, with the chance to develop into a frontline starter.",-1
"PERSON was a two-way standout at ORGANIZATION in GPE who jumped into top 10 pick conversations for his pitching ability. The ORGANIZATION nabbed him at 12 and gave him $4.1 million, a bit over pick value, to sign him away from ORGANIZATION, joining fellow Concordia product Ke'Bryan Hayes in the organization and making his brief pro debut in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON was dealt to the ORGANIZATION in August when he was announced as the Player to be Named Later in the trade for PERSON has a combination of deep repertoire and projection that gives him a very high ceiling. His fastball velocity picked up in his senior year. He'll sit at 92-96 mph and can reach back for 98 mph, with the ability to run and sink it while not losing velocity deep into his starts. He can miss bats with a plus cutter that he can turn into a true slider, and he also spins a distinctly different curveball. His changeup gives him another potential Major League average pitch. A solid athlete, PERSON should be able to find the strike zone consistently as he refines his delivery.Patience will be key for PERSON, and the ORGANIZATION know a thing or two about developing young pitching. With room to add strength to his athletic frame, PERSON could slowly move up the right-handed pitching prospect ranks as he settles in to his pro career.",-1
"A late bloomer in high school, ORGANIZATION opted for GPE instead of the ORGANIZATION, who had taken him in the 26th round in 2015. PERSON surgery wiped out his freshman year, but he came back and pitched well as the ORGANIZATION' Saturday starter. ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION stock surged as ORGANIZATION's ace during the spring, as he ranked second in the nation in strikeouts per nine innings (14.2) and garnered honors as one of 40 players named to ORGANIZATION. A regression in command cost him some traction late in the spring, but he still received a slightly above-slot bonus of $2,230,100 from PERSON after it selected him with the ORGANIZATION. 31 overall pick. Perhaps the hardest thrower among college hurlers in his class, ORGANIZATION consistently touched triple digits with his fastball during the spring while sitting at 97-100 on a regular basis. The left-hander complements his dynamic heater with a plus changeup, a pitch he throws with good arm speed that features a ton of late drop to it. ORGANIZATION's slider gives him a third at least average pitch.While ORGANIZATION's strikeout rate has been really high, his walk rate has been as well. That, plus a delivery that features a fairly big recoil, has led some evaluators to project him as a future reliever -- albeit one who could get to the big leagues in a hurry. But with a loose and very athletic frame, ORGANIZATION might be able to get away with those mechanics. He's elicited some PERSON comps, with some scouts thinking he has better stuff now, at least with the fastball, than PERSON did in his ORGANIZATION year.",-1
"ORGANIZATION spurned the ORGANIZATION as a 26th-rounder in 2015 and honored his commitment to GPE, only to have his freshman year wiped out by PERSON surgery. He emerged as one of more interesting pitching prospects in the 2018 ORGANIZATION as a junior by ranking second in the nation in strikeouts per nine innings (14.2), though a regression in command cost him some traction late in the spring. He still became a first-round pick in June, going to the ORGANIZATION with the ORGANIZATION. 31 overall pick, and received a slightly above-slot bonus of $2,230,100. ORGANIZATION impressed during his brief pro debut, making four scoreless starts during which he fanned 13 and allowed three hits across seven innings. ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION stock took off early last spring with reports of the left-hander's fastball reaching 100 mph. It set an unfair standard for his future outings, and some teams were turned off when he failed to achieve the same elite velocity in subsequent starts. That being said, ORGANIZATION does throw exceptionally hard, as he'll sit 92-95 mph and reach back for a few extra ticks. ORGANIZATION's slider, though inconsistent, is an above-average pitch and complements his heater nicely, and scouts believe that his upper-80s changeup will be at least average once he develops better feel. ORGANIZATION's high strikeout rate in college came with a high walk rate. That, plus a delivery that features a fairly big recoil, has led some evaluators to project him as a future reliever -- albeit one who could get to the big leagues in a hurry. But with a loose and very athletic frame, ORGANIZATION might be able to get away with those mechanics, and the ORGANIZATION are committed to developing him as a starter.",-1
"GPE's PERSON was the top catcher, and overall player, in the 2019 GPE, and went No. 1 overall as expected. PERSON, who shared catching duties with him on the GPE collegiate national team last summer, also landed in the top 10. He recovered from a rough sophomore season at the plate by performing better as a junior despite breaking the hamate in his left hand and rushing back after just three weeks. He homered three times and set an ORGANIZATION Division I tournament record with 11 RBIs in one game two days before the GPE, then was taken ninth overall by the ORGANIZATION, signing for a below pick value bonus of $3,997,500.PERSON would have been a first-round pick on his defense alone. He has a cannon arm that can produce 1.7-second pop times in workouts and 1.8-second clockings during games, and he used it to erase 70 percent of basestealers as sophomore. The 2018 Rawlings/ABCA Gold Glove recipient as the best defensive catcher in college baseball, he's a quality receiver who's more agile and athletic than most at his position. He also has the strong leadership skills teams desire in a backstop.Even when PERSON slumped last year, he still made consistent contact and doesn't have any glaring flaws in his right-handed stroke. It was more a matter of trying to do too much at the plate rather than letting his solid to plus raw power play without selling out for home runs. He's a below-average runner but quicker than a typical catcher.",-1
"PERSON drew interest as a right-hander with a low-90s fastball as an amateur in GPE, but he preferred to hit and signed with the ORGANIZATION as a third baseman for $200,000 in 2015. They also signed his brother Shendrik two years later but broke up the siblings when they included PERSON as the player to be named in the ORGANIZATION trade with the ORGANIZATION last summer.PERSON is still a work in progress offensively but has the upside of at least an average hitter with plus power. He has a strong and still-projectable 6-foot-4 build and shows pop to all fields, though he needs to adjust his right-handed stroke to get more balls in the air after posting an extreme 1.5 groundout/airout ratio in his first three seasons. He controls the strike zone well and makes repeated contact.Though he's athletic for his size, PERSON could wind up as a below-average runner once he fills out his big frame. He moves well and has a big arm at third base, though he has been an erratic defender early in his career. If he can't become more consistent or he slows down too much, he could wind up at first base.",-1
"Signed out of the GPE for $50,000 back in July 2015, GPE spent his first two pro seasons in the ORGANIZATION, faring much better in his return to the level in '17. That success prompted the ORGANIZATION to challenge GPE with an assignment to the Rookie-level Appalachian League for his GPE debut, and he responded by hitting for both average and power against advanced pitching, all while reaching base more than 40 percent of the time. An athletic, 6-foot-4 switch-hitter, GPE has shown a very advanced approach at the plate for a prospect his age, drawing a ton of walks and keeping his strikeout rate relatively low. With his mix of bat speed and strength, GPE has the physical tools needed to develop an above-average bat, though some evaluators do question his overall feel to hit, because his swing mechanics are inconsistent. He has plus raw power that he's already starting to get to, and given GPE's size, it's easy to dream on more as he matures.Defensively, GPE has shown the hands, footwork and instincts -- not to mention the plus arm strength -- to potentially stay at shortstop, though the ORGANIZATION played him more at second base in 2019, while also giving him reps at the hot corner. Regardless of where he ends up on the defensive spectrum, GPE should have the power-over-hit offensive profile and necessary defensive skills to be an impactful regular.",-1
" Signed out of the GPE for $50,000 back in July 2015, PERSON has taken a little while to get going.

He has excellent bat speed and strength, and could be an above-average hitter in the future. PERSON has hit from both sides of the plate, though his left-handed swing might be a touch better. He is starting to tap into his raw power, and given his size, it's easy to dream on more as he matures. While he's big for a shortstop with average speed, he has shown the hands, footwork and instincts -- not to mention enough arm -- to potentially stay at the position.PERSON has a while before he reaches his ceiling, and the ORGANIZATION will have to continue to be patient, but his tools are exciting and it looks like he's starting to tap into his considerable upside.",-1
"A strong showing on the summer showcase circuit put PERSON firmly on the GPE prospect map, looking for sure like a top-three-rounds pick. He didn't back that up during his senior year, causing some teams to back off. The ORGANIZATION weren't one of them, remembering his summer dominance when they took him in the second round. They gave PERSON an above-pick-value bonus of $1.85 million to sign him away from his GPE commitment, then watched him dominate over five scoreless outings in the ORGANIZATION and finish his pro debut as a 17 year old in the GPE. After a strong start to his full-season debut in 2019, PERSON was packaged with PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in July in the ORGANIZATION Stroman trade. After running his fastball up to 95 mph during the summer, PERSON sat more around 89-92 as a senior. But with his size, arm speed and athleticism, it was seemingly only a matter of time until velocity returned, and he spent his pro debut sitting around 93, while touching 97 with a riding fastball. PERSON's quick arm from a high-three-quarters slot helps him snap off a sharp, top-to-bottom curveball that shows plus potential, and he already demonstrates some feel for turning over an effective changeup.PERSON has a good delivery and repeats it well, but he'll need to show he can maintain his stuff deep into his outings and handle the rigors of a full season to remain a starter long term. There's certainly less concern about that after his impressive pro debut, and it'll now be up to the ORGANIZATION to further the young right-hander's development as he works to become a big league starter.",-1

He has outstanding bat-to-ball skills and makes a ton of contact. He doesn't strike out much, but he also doesn't draw many walks. Refinement of his approach will help his overall game, with the chance to be an above-average or better hitter. He can spray line drives all over the field and there could be more power to come as he adds strength. His speed should play on both sides of the ball, and he could play center field for a long time with at least an average arm.There is considerable upside for PERSON, though the ORGANIZATION will have to be patient in helping him get there. If it all clicks, he could be a dynamic everyday center fielder. At worst, he could be a valuable fourth outfielder in the big leagues.",-1
"Back in July 2015, PERSON was an intriguing prospect coming out of Venezuela who signed with the ORGANIZATION for $300,000. After beginning his career in that organization in the ORGANIZATION, he was declared a free agent by PERSON because of signing infractions involving him and four other prospects. The ORGANIZATION signed him quickly and he's been progressing methodically, making his GPE debut in '17 and getting his first taste of full-season ball in '18.As with most young hitters, PERSON still needs to work on refining his overall approach, but he already brings to the table the ability to make consistent contact, a knack for line drives and rarely striking out. He is starting to get more physical and is adding strength, so there is some hope there will be more power to come, though it's unlikely he'll ever be a huge home run threat. A solid athlete, PERSON runs well and has the instincts to steal some bases. He also has shown the ability to handle center field capably, sometimes showing plus defense out there, with a strong arm.If his bat can continue to develop and he can stay in center field, PERSON has the chance to be a solid big league regular. If not, his floor might be as an excellent contributor as a fourth outfielder.",-1
"PERSON may have been an under-the-radar signing back in 2015 when the ORGANIZATION nabbed him for just $35,000. But starting with his GPE debut in '16, when he won the ORGANIZATION ERA crown, he's been raising his prospect value exponentially. The only thing that's slowed him down has been the injury bug, with elbow inflammation shutting him down in early June in 2018, though that didn't stop the Marlins from insisting PERSON be included in the package they received for trading J.T. PERSON to GSP in February.When healthy, PERSON has perhaps the best combination of electric stuff and command of any pitcher in the ORGANIZATION. He might appear undersized at six-feet tall, but he's deceptively strong, with an athletic and repeatable delivery. PERSON throws both a two- and four-seam fastball, the former thrown with a lot of sink to get ground-ball outs and the latter cranked up to triple digits at times. Not only can PERSON maintain velocity deep into starts, the fastball plays up because of movement and his plus command of the pitch. He can add and subtract from his breaking ball, and seeing it as a future plus strikeout pitch isn't out of the question. He shows good feel for his changeup as well, giving him the chance to have at least three above-average offerings.PERSON's workload has been limited, partially because of understandable caution and partially because of injury. A healthy and complete 2019 should help get him ready for an eventual career at or near the top of a big league rotation.",-1

He repeats his delivery well and throws a lot of strikes, especially for a teenager. He'll throw his fastball consistently into the mid 90s and can reach back for more, throwing the heater with excellent movement to miss bats and generate groundball outs. His secondary stuff -- a curve and changeup -- has the chance to be at least PERSON average. He fields his position well, and while he is just 6-foot, his strength and athleticism point to a future as a starter.Considering he's only been pitching for about two years, and that his GPE debut went better than anyone could have expected, he raised expectations quite a bit for 2017.",-1

His race to GSP was slowed somewhat by elbow inflammation in 2018, and a sore collarbone cost him a chance to make up innings in the ORGANIZATION. In February 2019, the ORGANIZATION sent him, PERSON, PERSON and international pool money to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for J.T. Realmuto.It's hard not to get excited about PERSON's combination of pure stuff and feel for pitching. While he is just six feet tall, he's strong and athletic with a repeatable delivery that points to a future in a rotation. He can hit triple digits with his four-seam fastball and also features a two-seamer with a ton of sinking action. His fastball is better than its pure velocity because of its movement as well as his ability to command it extremely well. His secondary stuff continues to improve, with a breaking ball he adds and subtracts from and a changeup he shows a good feel for at times. Both will flash above-average to plus, and given his overall feel for pitching, there is confidence both will get there consistently in time.PERSON has one of the highest ceilings among PERSON pitchers and possesses all the ingredients needed to headline a big league rotation.

"First impressions aren't the be-all and end-all in the often long development path for prospects, but they certainly don't hurt. After signing for just $35,000 in 2015, PERSON had a fairly ordinary debut in the ORGANIZATION. But when he showed up to pitch in the GPE for the first time in 2016, he was lights out and led the ORGANIZATION in ERA.A very efficient strike-thrower, PERSON isn't the tallest right-hander in the world, but he has plenty of arm. He'll throw his fastball consistently in the 93-96 mph range and was up to 97-98 mph at times last summer. He separates himself from others at his level because of his outstanding fastball command, throwing his heater with movement in the zone that gets ground-ball outs and swings and misses. His curve is developing and could be a plus pitch in the future, and he has a good feel for his changeup. He's strong and athletic, repeating his delivery well.Between extended spring training and the ORGANIZATION in 2016, PERSON threw about 90 innings.

After selecting college players with its first four picks, the A's went well over slot to land PERSON in the fourth round, giving him $1 million to forego his commitment to GPE.PERSON uses a quick arm and strong frame to generate consistent 90-92 mph fastballs and can reach 95. His high-three-quarters delivery enables him to stay on top of his hard curveball, a solid second offering. He also shows some aptitude for throwing a changeup, though it can get too firm at times.PERSON has a little less arm strength but better secondary pitches than GPE high school righties PERSON and PERSON, both of whom the ORGANIZATION selected in the first round a year ago. His control and command are improving, so there's little doubt that he can make it as a starter in pro ball.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION were very aggressive on the international market in July 2017, signing a pair of players for seven figures in shortstop PERSON and outfielder PERSON. They also signed ORGANIZATION for $500,000 that July and while the teenager wasn't as high profile a signing as the other two, he nonetheless made it to the GPE during his debut summer, playing in the ORGANIZATION in 2018.A one-time shortstop, ORGANIZATION is now a full-time outfielder, where his tools and athleticism have the chance to play well. He's seen time in both center and right field, with an easily plus arm that could help him profile in the corner spot down the road. He's very projectable offensively, with the potential to have future plus power thanks to his physicality and bat speed, to go along with good hand-eye coordination. There is some length to his swing, but the ORGANIZATION think that might have to do more with inexperience and lack of present strength than anything mechanical.There's a long development path ahead for ORGANIZATION to get to what he eventually might become. The ORGANIZATION have never shied away from working with young international signees and will let ORGANIZATION dictate how quickly he moves through the system.",-1

He signed out of the ORGANIZATION in 2015 for $2.6 million, the largest bonus GPE paid to a non-Cuban during its record international spending binge in 2015-16. He offers tantalizing upside but also the widest gap between his ceiling and floor of any Dodgers farmhand.PERSON has tape-measure power thanks to lightning bat speed, prodigious strength (he weighs much more than his listed 200 pounds) and the leverage in his right-handed swing. There are times when he keeps his stroke compact and shows the ability to make adjustments, and others when his swing gets much too long and he looks lost at the plate. He looked overmatched when he reached low Class A last August and again this spring before an eye injury sidelined him in June.PERSON moves well for his size, showing average speed out of the batter's box and a step more quickness once he gets going, though he'll slow down as he continues to get bigger. He has played all three outfield positions as a pro, getting most of his action in left field. It's hard to know what to make of him as a defender because reports on him are all over the place, with grades ranging from 30-55 on his fielding and 40-60 on his arm.",-1

The ORGANIZATION signed the ORGANIZATION for $2.6 million in July 2015, giving him the largest bonus they paid a non-Cuban as part of their record international spending spree that year. He continued to show power and speed during his 2016 debut in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION and will come to the GPE this year.Already physically imposing at age 18, PERSON carries more than the listed 200 pounds on his 6-foot-2 frame. He combines bat speed, strength and leverage from the right side of the plate and can drive the ball great distances. There are no red flags with his swing or approach, though he'll have to make the necessary adjustments as he faces better quality pitching.Though PERSON spent most of his debut in left field and GPE plans to give him more time in center in 2017, he projects more as a right fielder. He has the strong arm for the position and figures to lose some speed as he continues to mature physically. If he hones his instincts and stays on top of his conditioning, he can become an average defender in right.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION spent more money than any team on the international market this summer. They gave GPE right-hander PERSON a $16 million bonus, and PERSON was their second-biggest expenditure at $2.6 million. One of the strongest and most physical players in the 2015 international class, PERSON has a big swing that can launch baseballs great distances when he makes contact. He may have to tone down his approach to succeed against professional pitching, though he did perform well in game action in the ORGANIZATION League.Presently a solid runner, PERSON figures to lose a step as he adds more strength. That would necessitate a move from center to right field, and his strong arm would play well at the latter position.",-1
"GPE of the ORGANIZATION' massive international spending spree in 2015, PERSON signed for $2.6 million, the largest bonus the club gave to a non-Cuban. He impressed on the tryout circuit, regularly showing big power in batting practice and plus 60-yard-dash times, and finished second in the home run derby at the 2014 Under PERSON All-America Game. One of the strongest and most physically mature players in the 2015 international class, PERSON already carries 200 pounds on his 6-foot-2 frame at age 17. PERSON generates impressive bat speed and leverage from the right side of the plate. His swing can get long and he may need to tone down his approach against pro pitching, though he did perform well in GPE Prospect League games.Though he signed as a center fielder, PERSON figures to lose a step off his solid speed and eventually move to right field. Both his power potential and his arm strength would fit nicely at that position.",-1
"Signed by the ORGANIZATION for $35,000 out of GPE in 2013, PERSON has slowly but surely pitched himself into prospect status. After some inconsistent seasons early in his career, he showed signs of turning the corner in his second-full season campaign before breaking out in earnest in 2019 at age 22. He dominated out of the bullpen at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Potomac, posting a 0.53 ERA with 26 strikeouts in 17 innings, and continued to pitch well following a May promotion to Double-A Harrisburg, excelling in his first true audition as a starter. PERSON stands out for his pitchability, but he also has some sneaky good stuff. He'll touch 93-94 mph and sits in the low 90s with his fastball, throwing it with natural sinking action that nets him a bunch of ground balls. His changeup is a plus offering, one that generates whiffs for him against hitters on both sides of the plate with its diving action, and he adeptly mixes in an average slider that has two-plane break. He can throw all three pitches for strikes and doesn't hurt himself by issuing many free passes. PERSON' ability to work effectively in various roles is an asset, and club officials view him as a potential multi-inning reliever much like former ORGANIZATION hurler PERSON. At the same time, it wouldn't surprise anyone in the organization if PERSON were to continue to excel as a starter en route to a spot in the back of a big league rotation.",-1
"Despite his lack of size and premium stuff, PERSON was having an outstanding collegiate career at ORGANIZATION, serving as the team's No. 2 starter during its College World Series run in 2016 and earning Big 12 Conference Pitcher of the ORGANIZATION honors the following season. After a strong turn with the GPE national collegiate team last summer, there was excitement about his junior season, but it ended early when he blew out his elbow in February and needed PERSON surgery. The ORGANIZATION decided it was worth the risk to take PERSON and let him rehab with their staff, signing him in the fourth round for an above-pick-value bonus of $825,000. He suffered a setback while rehabbing during Spring Training that further delayed the start to his pro career. PERSON's velocity on his fastball is fringy, sitting at 88-92 mph and occasionally touching 94, but it plays up because it has good sink and he can command it to both sides of the plate. It's also helped by his best pitch, a plus fading changeup that was among the best in the 2018 Draft class. PERSON has an average curveball as well, one that he throws for strikes consistently.PERSON's ceiling is somewhat limited to that of a back-end starter. At the same time, he does have a fairly high floor as a pitchability lefty who can eat a lot of innings and is a plus competitor.

"PERSON didn't think they were going to get to see Jennings much this past spring because the star quarterback at ORGANIZATION in GPE tore his anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in September. But not only did he get back in time for baseball season, he turned out to be the top prep prospect in the state, landing in the second round and getting an above-pick value bonus to sign him away from his GPE commitment.Jennings has a loose, quick arm that delivers fastballs regularly in the 89-92 mph range. He can touch 95 mph and should add velocity in the future as he fills out his 6-foot-2 frame. He'll touch the mid-80s with his hard slider, which could be plus in time, and his curve gives him another solid option as well. While he didn't use his changeup much, he has shown a feel for it, giving him the chance to have four at-least-average offerings.Jennings' athleticism plays well on the mound, helping him to repeat his delivery and throw strikes. Now no longer splitting focus among two sports, there could be quite a bit of upside to unlock here.",-1
"Jennings was a two-sport star at ORGANIZATION in GPE, serving as ace pitcher as well as quarterback for the football team. A torn ORGANIZATION during the fall of his senior year left many wondering how much mound time he'd get, but he turned out to be the best prep prospect in the state. The ORGANIZATION went above pick value to sign him for $1.9 million in the second round and he made his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION League.Jennings provides an intriguing combination of feel for pitching, projectability and athleticism to the system. He's more of a pitchability right-hander right now, with a fastball he throws 89-92 mph. But he can reach back for more and there might be more velocity to come as he physically matures. He commands the fastball well, moves it in and out and throws it with movement. He'll throw two breaking balls, the slider is liked more by evaluators, and he might focus on just one in the future, and he has good feel for his changeup.The athleticism comes in handy in terms of repeating his delivery and filling the strike zone with all of his pitches. How much his stuff ticks up as he matures and as he focuses on baseball only will determine what kind of starting pitcher he eventually becomes.",-1
"The best high school prospect out of GPE in the 2017 GPE class, GPE was a two-sport athlete who got past a torn ORGANIZATION suffered during his senior football season to pitch his way into the second round of the GPE. The ORGANIZATION went over slot to give him $1.9 million to sign rather than head to GPE. While the results on paper don't look great, the ORGANIZATION are still very bullish on his combination of athleticism and feel for pitching.GPE will rely on his ability to command his four-pitch mix, rather than be that prototypical projectable power pitcher. Very athletic on the mound, he has the chance to have above-average control of all four offerings. His fastball typically sits around average, though he can reach back for 94 mph on occasion. Without a big frame, there might not be a ton of strength to add, so this might be more or less where he stands velocity-wise. The good news is that he does a nice job using his fastball, two distinct breaking balls -- the ORGANIZATION like the slider a little bit more than the curve but they do complement each other -- and his changeup to keep hitters from barreling up the baseball.Some evaluators see some PERSON in GPE as an athletic right-hander with a repeatable delivery who will use command and savvy to get big league hitters out. If he can do that and sharpen a breaking ball to become more of an out pitch, he could profile closer to the middle of a rotation.",-1
"PERSON PERSON surgery is never thought of as a positive achievement, despite it becoming almost commonplace among young pitchers these days. But there might be a silver lining in having needed the surgery in 2018 for PERSON, the 6-foot-6 right-hander who got $100,000 to sign in Dec. 2016. Yes, he missed development time on the mound by being out for all of 2018, but the strength and conditioning that went along with rehabbing the injury could help him take a big step when he returns to the mound.Before PERSON went down with injury, he had already improved strength-wise enough to add velocity to his fastball. What was a 90-91 mph heater when he first signed was touching 96 mph at instructs in the fall of 2017 with excellent spin and riding life. He's filled out even more now, so dreaming about more velocity once he gets his feet under him isn't unrealistic. He can really spin his breaking ball, giving him the chance for a second plus pitch, and he'll continue to work on what could be a decent changeup. With his size, PERSON will have to work at repeating his delivery. He'll get a chance to do that as he puts his rehab in the rearview mirror and hopefully gets a full season of work in 2019.",-1
"If it seems like the GPE are collecting intriguing, young pitching prospects courtesy of their efforts on the international amateur market, looks are not deceiving. PERSON, a 6-foot-6 right-hander signed in December 2016, might have as much ceiling as any of them, though he also might have the furthest to go to get there, especially since offseason PERSON surgery kept him from pitching during the 2018 season.The GPE compare PERSON's fastball-curve combination with that of PERSON in terms of future impact and he used it to pitch his way from the ORGANIZATION to a brief taste of pro ball in the GPE in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION. When PERSON signed, he was 90-91 mph with his fastball, but thanks to some big strength gains, he was touching 96 mph and sitting 93-94 mph last fall at instructs, thrown with plus spin and riding life up in the zone. His curve already flashes plus with a very high spin rate, while his changeup will flash average, though it needs work.PERSON doesn't have as athletic a delivery as GPE, and will need to continue to work to repeat it effectively. If he can get more consistent with his direction to the plate, his command should get better, as should his already impressive raw stuff.",-1
"Since 2003, PERSON has produced 10 big league pitchers (most notably PERSON) and six arms selected in the top two rounds. PERSON was a surprise addition to that latter group after entering 2019 with little Draft buzz but creating plenty of it by leading the LOCATION with a 1.32 ERA that ranked third in ORGANIZATION Division I. The ORGANIZATION selected him in the supplemental first round with a pick acquired in the ORGANIZATION trade with the ORGANIZATION and signed him for $1,949,800.PERSON usually pitches at 89-91 mph with run and sink on his fastball from a lower three-quarters slot, and he also can raise his arm angle and reach back for 93-95 mph when needed. He excels at manipulating the shape of his 78-83 mph slider, which features high spin rates and can be a plus offering at its best. He also has nice feel for his sinking changeup and the trust to use it in any count.PERSON's stocky frame and crossfire delivery aren't the prettiest, but his stuff plays up because of the angle and extension he creates and because he's supremely confident. He throws strikes, will go inside against left-handers and right-handers and sequences his pitches well. He had one of the highest floors among college pitchers in the 2019 Draft, projecting as at least a lefty reliever in the Majors with a good chance of becoming a No. 4 starter.",-1
"Primarily an infielder as an amateur in the GPE, PERSON signed with the GPE for $200,000 and focused on pitching for the first time. Very much a raw project, he threw just 58 total innings in two pro summers before he was sent to the Pirates along with PERSON in return for PERSON and PERSON Moroff.At 6-foot-4, PERSON is an extremely athletic and projectable right-hander who has a long way to go before fulfilling his potential, considerable as it might be. His fastball in 2018 clocked in the 92-96 mph range with life up in the zone and it's much more control over command with it right now -- he's around the strike zone with it, but not putting it where he wants it at all times. His low-80s slider flashes plus with good biting action to it. He hasn't shown much of a changeup, showing one around 85-87 mph the few times he's thrown it, another area of focus as he moves forward.PERSON is the epitome of a long-range project, but the feel for his stuff and his athleticism give him a chance to eventually get there as a starting pitcher. He'd be just the second GPE hurler to reach the big leagues and the first player of any sort from the country to get there since PERSON played briefly with the ORGANIZATION in 2014.",-1
"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 40 | Run: 55 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45It's certainly not uncommon to have the ORGANIZATION batting champ rated highly for the next year's Draft. When that batting champion is almost certainly going to be drafted to pitch, that is a little more unusual. That was the dilemma with PERSON ahead of the 2018 Draft until the ORGANIZATION, an organization one year removed from drafting two-way phenom PERSON in the first round, selected him with the ORGANIZATION. 71 overall pick and announced that he would both play the outfield and pitch in the professional ranks. He excelled on both sides of the ball during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League, converting skeptics of his two-way potential into believers. PERSON showed power stuff in an explosive 95-98 mph fastball and a wipeout slider that touched 91 mph while coming out of PERSON's bullpen. The combo is already lethal on right-handed hitters, and he still has room to improve his control and command. When he's not on the mound, PERSON is an above-average defender in center field who hits for average from both sides of the plate and contributes on the basepaths with above-average wheels. The early returns from the start of PERSON's two-way career were all positive. He posted a 0.68 ORGANIZATION and averaged a strikeout-per-inning across 25 frames, holding hitters to a paltry .143 average. At the plate, he slashed .273/.344/.369 with 12 extra-base hits and eight steals. It will be interesting to see how well and for how long PERSON can continue that level of production in both roles, but even as just a reliever he offers the ORGANIZATION plenty of value given his late-inning potential.",-1
"GPE was a solid prospect who played for former big league closer PERSON in high school, albeit one who was 19 years old and with a strong commitment to the ORGANIZATION of PERSON. After a solid first season as the starting shortstop for the ORGANIZATION, GPE' All-Star turn in the ORGANIZATION raised his profile, and he continued to hit extremely well as a Draft-eligible sophomore, ultimately earning a selection in the fifth round by ORGANIZATION. GPE has a very good track record of hitting, and most scouts believe he'll continue to hit for average at the next level. The left-handed hitter sends a lot of line drives the other way and controls the strike zone extremely well. PERSON's home park is not conducive to power, nor is GPE' current approach, but as he continues to learn how to turn on pitches on the inner half of the plate and fills out his 6-foot-2 frame, there could be more pop coming in the future. There's less belief in GPE' ability to play shortstop than there is in his bat. While he has decent hands and enough arm, he's not a runner, with most thinking he'll profile better at second base as a pro. PERSON has produced several players who had a strong foundation for hitting, with many of them going on to add power as they developed. That's the hope for GPE, who could be a solid offensive-minded second baseman when all is said and done.",-1
"PERSON PERSON surgery wiped out much of PERSON's 2016 and his entire 2017 season at ORGANIZATION, but the D-backs still took a shot on him in that June's ORGANIZATION, selecting him in the 29th round. He chose not to sign and returned to GPE, where he had an uneven performance, especially with his control. The ORGANIZATION saw untapped potential in PERSON for that very same reason, and they went above slot to sign him for $350,000 after taking him in the ninth round. He's quickly proved to be one of the ORGANIZATION's biggest steals with a dominant first full season that saw him rack up a ton of strikeouts in GPE State League before advancing to Double-A in early July and recording double-digit strikeouts in his first three starts. PERSON pounds the zone with a 92-95 mph fastball that reaches 97 and features late life when he locates up in the zone. His above-average curveball in the low-to-mid-80s is his go-to secondary offering and nets him a ton of whiffs, and he also shows good feel for commanding and misses bats with short, tight slider. PERSON's changeup is a clear fourth pitch for him, though it stands to improve considerably as he learns to better control his arm speed. Staying healthy in the pro ranks hasn't been an issue for PERSON, and he's impressed the organization with his confidence and composure on the mound. He's quickly established himself as one of the top pitchers in the organization, giving the organization a left-handed complement to their rising crop of impressive right-handed starters.",-1
"An assumption is made about two-sport high school athletes, that while they might have tools, they will be raw and underdeveloped. ORGANIZATION, who got a way-above-pick-value $3.2 million to sign rather than go to PERSON to play baseball, was actually a baseball player who played football, not the other way around. As a result, he's shown much more refined skills during his pro debut than many anticipated.ORGANIZATION has the chance to be a true five-tool player. With an advanced approach, ORGANIZATION was a better hitter than expected during his debut. He showed an ability to work counts and draw walks. He has plenty of raw power from the left side of the plate and should be able to start tapping into it soon. His outstanding speed plays on the bases and allows him to cover ground in the outfield. He's good in center field but needs to let his instincts take over a little. Some see him filling out and moving to a corner, likely left because of his average arm.ORGANIZATION has seen more time in left during his first full season, though he continues to get reps in center as well. He's performed out of the gate better than many high school prospects the Reds have drafted, and ORGANIZATION think ORGANIZATION has the chance to be a special player.",-1
"ORGANIZATION was a talented multi-sport athlete from the high school ranks in GPE, one who had the chance to play football and baseball at ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION liked his tools on the diamond enough to go way above pick value to give him $3.2 million as the ORGANIZATION. 35 overall pick in the 2016 Draft. He rewarded the organization's faith with a very productive first full season in the ORGANIZATION in 2017.Everyone knew ORGANIZATION's athleticism would help make him an exciting prospect, but his feel for the game has exceeded many expectations. While there is some swing and miss he'll continue to work on, ORGANIZATION's strikeout rate went down and his walk rate went up in the second half of his first full season. His ability to draw walks allows him to use his speed to be a basestealing threat on a more regular basis. He has shown the ability to drive the ball with extra-base pop, and there should be more over-the-fence power to come as he matures. His speed works well in the outfield and most feel he could stick in center field, though his fringy arm could push him to left down the road.Wherever he plays defensively, ORGANIZATION has the tools to impact the game in a number of ways. The development of his bat and speed as he moves up the ladder will be one of the more exciting ORGANIZATION prospect storylines to watch in 2018.",-1
"A tremendous multi-sport athlete who could have played football in college, ORGANIZATION decided to focus on baseball, committing to PERSON on the diamond only. The ORGANIZATION will never get him in uniform as the ORGANIZATION went above pick value to give him $3.2 million as the ORGANIZATION. 35 overall pick in the 2016 Draft.Because he was dividing his focus between sports for most of high school, ORGANIZATION is still a bit raw as a baseball player. He is learning how to recognize pitches and handle offspeed stuff, as well as how to tap into his raw power. He does have plenty of bat speed and strength, which should allow him to develop at least PERSON average power. He's also working on his defensive game, but he has everything you'd like to see from a future center fielder. His arm is fringy, but it's enough for center.Patience might be key for the ORGANIZATION player development staff, but ORGANIZATION is the kind of uber-athlete who could eventually develop into a star at the highest level. Clearly, the ORGANIZATION think he can be that kind of player given the bonus they handed out to get him.",-1
"When the ORGANIZATION signed PERSON as the ORGANIZATION. 2 pick in the 2016 Draft for more than $1.5 million under pick value, it enabled them to land ORGANIZATION for $3.2 million at ORGANIZATION. 35 overall. The former GPE high school star impressed at every stop of his development until stumbling a bit at Double-A in 2019. He really stood out on a national stage when he won ORGANIZATION honors at the ORGANIZATION in '18 after homering and tripling and then returned to the ORGANIZATIONs again this July before being traded to the ORGANIZATION later in the month in the three-team deal that sent PERSON from the GPE to the ORGANIZATION.A multi-sport athlete in high school who had the chance to play football at ORGANIZATION, ORGANIZATION's combination of natural ability, feel for the game and makeup have continued to lift him as he progresses through the system. In the ORGANIZATION State League in 2018, while dealing with a nagging ankle injury, he continued efforts to lower his strikeout rate and draw walks, and he still showed left-handed pop while driving the ball. His ability to get on base will make him a regular stolen base threat that could frustrate defenses. That speed gives ORGANIZATION the chance to be a future center fielder. He has a below average arm, something he worked on during his stint in the ORGANIZATION. If he continues to get bigger and stronger and it slows him down, his bat should profile just fine in a corner outfield spot.",-1
"The PERSON family just keeps churning out professional baseball players. PERSON is the third of three brothers to head into pro ball, following their father PERSON, who is still coaching in pro ball as the ORGANIZATION' quality control coach, into the family business. PERSON's also the best prospect of the trio, and after a big junior season at the ORGANIZATION of GPE in 2018, he became the ORGANIZATION' third-round pick and kept on hitting during his pro debut in the short-season LOCATION League.Put simply, PERSON just hits wherever he goes. Utilizing a short stroke from the left side of the plate, he always stays within himself, focusing on using the middle of the field. The result is line drives to all fields, consistently professional at-bats with a strong strikeout-to-walk ratio, and some sneaky extra-base authority. On the other side of the ball, PERSON is a steady, but not flashy, defender who makes all the plays from multiple positions. He can handle shortstop, but his arm and range might not be a fit to be a regular there. He plays a very good second base as ORGANIZATION love infielders with positional flexibility, and PERSON will mix some third base in as he moves forward.

He joined the organization on a full-time basis in 2018, when PERSON made him a fifth-round pick after he starred as a reliever at ORGANIZATION. He has had little difficulty transitioning to starting in pro ball, going five straight starts and 34 2/3 consecutive innings without permitting an earned run in May and June.PERSON's best pitch is a plus 81-85 mph slider with sharp bite. He can land it for strikes or get hitters to chase it out of the zone, and he also can morph it into an upper-80s cutter.

Though he has below-average speed, he's aggressive on the bases and has good feel for picking spots to steal.PERSON played mostly left field at ORGANIZATION, showing at least average arm strength but limited range. The hope is that he can become an adequate defender in left, though he could wind up at first base or DH.

His stroke can get long at times and he's still raw after dividing his time between two sports, but he shows some aptitude for hitting and should improve once he focuses on baseball.",-1
"ORGANIZATION was a reliever for ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION Team but otherwise spent his college career in ORGANIZATION's rotation, spending two years as the program's Friday night ace. His GPE appeal was tied to his future in that role, so naturally there was concern when forearm tightness forced him to miss several starts as a junior. He still earned a second-round selection that June, and then reached PERSON in his pro debut after signing for slot value.ORGANIZATION might have had the best breaking ball in his GPE class, a 12-to-6 hammer that is widely viewed as at least a plus pitch. ORGANIZATION will throw it whenever he wants in the count and can command it very well in the strike zone. He throws it from the same plane as his fastball, giving hitters little chance to pick it up. That, in turn, allows his 90-93 mph fastball to be more effective. It has more run than sink, with average life overall, and ORGANIZATION can throw it to both sides of the plate consistently. His changeup is a little firm and a distant third pitch, but he shows enough feel for it to be a future average offering.ORGANIZATION isn't the biggest guy in the world at 6 feet, and concern about overuse during his time at ORGANIZATION certainly wasn't assuaged with his 2018 injury. The Nationals expect to see a better, more physical version of him moving forward, and the hope is that he can move quickly through the ORGANIZATION en route to a spot at the back of GPE's big league rotation.",-1

Ultimately, it could translate to above-average power as PERSON grows into his projectable frame and learns to hit the ball in the air. He hasn't quite tapped into that raw power just yet, but he's well beyond his years with his approach. PERSON has a knack for recognizing pitches and a willingness to take a walk.PERSON has played some center field at the lower levels, but he's unlikely to stay there.

"Signed from the same GPE Red City Devils team that produced PERSON and PERSON, PERSON landed a $1.5 million bonus from the ORGANIZATION in 2016.

It could translate to above-average game power for PERSON as he grows into his projectable frame and learns to hit the ball in the air more consistently. His patient approach, ability to recognize pitches and willingness to take a walk stand out for his age, and evaluators expect PERSON to trim some of the swing-and-miss from his game as he gains experience. Adding to PERSON' allure is the fact that he spent much of his pro debut manning center field.

"Originally a sixth-round pick of the ORGANIZATION in 2016 out of the GPE prep ranks, PERSON delivered an impressive performance last season with PERSON that caught the attention of the ORGANIZATION, who acquired him in July in exchange for PERSON. He opened even more eyes with PERSON after the trade, turning in five dominant starts to finish his GPE York-Penn League campaign with a 3.54 ERA, a 0.98 ORGANIZATION and a 73-to-10 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 56 innings. As a teenager in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON showed feel for locating a fastball that sat 93-96 mph with late movement. He throws his curveball with tight spin that gives it late downer action, and scouts believe it could be a plus pitch once fully developed. PERSON also has an advanced changeup relative to his age and experience, giving the young righty three solid offerings that should allow him to stick as a starter. He's athletic and repeats both his delivery and arm action well, and club officials have already been impressed with his capacity for making mechanical adjustments. PERSON may be an undersized right-hander, but his athleticism, arsenal and overall feel all qualify him to remain a starter during his rise through the ORGANIZATION. He'll need to make adjustments along the way, but it's the profile of a mid-rotation starter if everything clicks.",-1
"GPE of GPE's 2014-15 international class, GPE has impressed the club with the quick progress he's made early in his career. After a rocky GPE debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, GPE was overmatched with an Opening Day assignment to Class A Short-Season Auburn in 2017. The right-hander fared much better back in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, where he showed improved feel for his promising stuff.Young and projectable, GPE uses his height to leverage the baseball to the plate, working in the low-90s with his fastball and pairing it with an above-average curveball that features 12-to-6, downer shape. ORGANIZATION officials expect GPE to add more velocity as he grows into his lean and athletic frame.The Nationals speak highly of GPE's cerebral approach to pitching and expect his control and command to both improve as he gains experience and develops physically. He's poised to make gains on that front in 2018, in his age-20 season.",-1
"PERSON was steady as a freshman reliever and sophomore starter at PERSON, but he wasn't a priority target after sitting in the mid-80s with his fastball in the ORGANIZATION last summer. Then he was spectacular in his first five starts of 2019, including a complete-game one-hitter with 13 strikeouts against The ORGANIZATION on just 88 pitches, looking like a potential supplemental first-rounder and the ORGANIZATION' best pitching prospect since PERSON. The D-backs took PERSON with the ORGANIZATION. 74 overall pick in the June Draft, then watched as the southpaw fired a two-hit, 10-strikeout shutout against PERSON to help lead PERSON into the ORGANIZATION World Series finals. When he's at his best, PERSON is commanding all three of his pitches well. He'll operate 91-92 mph and peak at 94 with high spin rates on his fastball. He can induce swings and misses with a fading changeup and a slider with depth, both of which arrived in the low 80s.PERSON floods the zone with strikes and generates a bunch of ugly swings when he's on top of his game. However, he'll need to answer questions about his durability in pro ball after his fastball dipped into the upper 80s and his secondary pitches weren't as sharp late in his junior campaign.",-1
"PERSON teamed with PERSON to help PERSON (PERSON, Ga.) win the GPE state 5-A baseball championship as a senior in 2016. Both headed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE, where PERSON starred at quarterback while PERSON emerged as a key starter on a GPE team that won a school-record 21 LOCATION Conference games in 2019. While there's debate as to whether he winds up as a starter or reliever in the long run, there's no question that his arm was among the best in college baseball's top conference.PERSON operates at 92-95 mph and touches 97 with his fastball, using his high-three-quarters arm slot to create downhill plane. He maintains his velocity throughout his starts and figures to hit 100 mph if he works shorter stints out of the bullpen. His low-80s slider can be sharp and a solid pitch when he commands it, and he also shows promising shape on a curveball that's a work in progress.Mostly about power, PERSON hasn't shown much of a changeup. He's strong and physical, though to remain a starter he'll have to do a better job of repeating his delivery and commanding his pitches. If he does become a reliever, he has late-inning potential and perhaps a chance to become a closer.",-1

He can throw a true hammer curve in the mid-80s that also misses bats to give him a second above-average pitch, but he doesn't have much of a feel for a changeup yet. PERSON has a bit of a cross-fire delivery. When he's online, he's as good as anyone in the system, but he comes in and out of it, making it tougher for him to command the baseball.A better athlete than you'd think given his size, PERSON should be able make the adjustments necessary to the mechanical flaws in his delivery so he can take full advantage of his stuff.",-1
"A large-sized, power-armed pitcher taken in the second round out of the GPE high school ranks in 2015, PERSON struggled over his first two professional seasons but turned the corner in 2017 and made many improvements in 2018 with his best year yet en route to being named the organization's ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year.Scouts believe PERSON can be a frontline starter. He possesses a well above-average fastball that stays consistently at 93-97 mph with good movement, even deep into his starts. His secondary pitches are also becoming formidable, with scouts particularly noticing a huge improvement in his changeup. Although it can be a plus pitch, PERSON needs to continue developing his slider's consistency. ORGANIZATION and control were areas where PERSON needed to improve entering last season and he often succeeded as his walk rate dropped from 2017 to '18.Already a big guy when drafted, he's gotten even bigger and thicker since to access more power while remaining durable. After he spent a half-season at Double-A a year ago, he is getting closer to putting it all together to reach his ceiling.",-1
"A two-way player from the GPE high school ranks, PERSON was a bit of a pop-up prospect heading into the 2015 Draft. The ORGANIZATION loved his arm strength and grabbed him the second round and are pleased with the progress he's made during his first full season.PERSON might have as big of stuff as anyone in the system. He'll throw his fastball in the 95-100 mph range and he combines it with a plus slider, and he misses bats with both of them. His changeup is still below average, but it has gotten a little better as he throws it more. He has struggled with finding the strike zone at times, largely because of mechanical issues, but he worked to clean up his delivery during the 2016 season and in instructs last fall. A big-bodied right-hander, PERSON is a decent athlete, but he does need to improve his stamina. PERSON needs to keep working on harnessing his plus stuff over the course of a season while refining his command. If that happens, he could enter the conversation of some of the better right-handed pitching prospects in the game.",-1
"After watching PERSON pop up on GPE radars in 2015, the ORGANIZATION took the hard-throwing GPE high school product in the second round of that June's GPE. His first taste of full-season ball, in 2016, didn't go so well, but he started figuring things out in 2017, taking the biggest step forward among the top arms at the lower levels of the ORGANIZATION' system.PERSON looked more like the future big league starter the ORGANIZATION envisioned in 2017, finishing fifth in the organization in both ORGANIZATION and strikeouts and among the ORGANIZATION leaders in several pitching categories. PERSON's plus plus fastball will touch the upper-90s consistently with good movement and will always be his best pitch. The right-hander made huge strides with his changeup in 2017 to the point where it now looks like it will be an above-average pitch. His focus on his changeup did lead to him losing some usage of his slider, though the hard breaking ball still flashes plus.Command and control will be the next things PERSON will have to improve on in order to make the next step. The big-bodied flame-thrower showed more stamina and durability in 2017. Now it's time for him to put it all together in order to reach his ceiling as a frontline starter.",-1
"ORGANIZATION started racing up ORGANIZATION boards as PERSON approached in 2016 as he was touching 95 mph with his fastball. The ORGANIZATION love developing young pitching and took the GPE high school product in the second round, a bit ahead of where the industry had him. He had a solid pro debut in the ORGANIZATION League.ORGANIZATION entered pro ball a bit on the raw side, but he has the makings of a very good three-pitch mix coming from an athletic build that has already shown the ability to take on strength. His fastball typically sits in the low 90s and he throws it with good sink to get groundball outs. There is confidence he will add velocity as he physically matures. He has a good feel for his changeup already and there are glimpses of a solid curveball, though he can't always throw it for strikes. It may take some time, but ORGANIZATION's athleticism should allow him to repeat his delivery and find the strike zone consistently.The right-hander has already impressed with his makeup and work ethic, taking advantage of being from GPE and spending all offseason in GPE. He's already showing more strength, with a jump in stuff a strong possibility.",-1
"The epitome of a projectable right-hander, ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION stock rose with an uptick in velocity during his senior year in the GPE high school ranks in 2016. The ORGANIZATION liked him a bit more than other teams and nabbed him in the second round, albeit for a below pick value bonus. An encouraging debut in the ORGANIZATION that summer was followed up by a rough move to the GPE League in 2017, proving there is much work to be done. He took some encouraging steps in 2018, reaching full-season LOCATION, but was put on the disabled list in late August and ended up needing PERSON surgery in September, which will keep him out for all of the 2019 season.ORGANIZATION was starting to iron out some issues with his delivery before the injury, after the ORGANIZATION thought he may have been tipping some of his pitches in the PERSON, greatly contributing to his struggles. PERSON stuff-wise, he wasn't in a bad place. His fastball topped out at 96 mph in 2017 and he threw it a majority of the time as he worked to establish his fastball command. His secondary stuff is behind, but he does have good feel for an average changeup and can spin a breaking ball, though it is inconsistent at this point. He did a good job of throwing strikes overall, and his command in the zone was improving after PERSON opponnents hit a robust .339 against him in 2017.ORGANIZATION was taking the next step in learning how to pitch, mixing in all of his weapons and setting up hitters effectively, before the elbow injury. He's still growing into his body and there is still projection to him, so the ORGANIZATION are more than willing to be patient.",-1
"ORGANIZATION was a bit of a pop-up ORGANIZATION prospect this spring, hailing from the GPE high school ranks. He was creating some late buzz as the ORGANIZATION approached, eventually landing in the second round, where the ORGANIZATION were able to sign him for $900,000, a bit below pick value.The 18-year-old right-hander does have some upside, thanks to his 6-foot-3 frame and repeatable delivery. Right now, ORGANIZATION fires his fastball in the low 90s, touching 94 mph, but there's a good chance there will be more in the tank velocity-wise. He has a very good feel for his changeup, his second best pitch, an offspeed offering that might eventually be an above-average pitch. His breaking ball, a curve, is his third pitch, but he shows an ability to spin it. PERSON generally around the strike zone, his athleticism on the mound should allow him to improve his control and command as he matures.The ORGANIZATION have not shied away from drafting high school arms with ceiling, willing to take the risk involved. If everything clicks for ORGANIZATION, he could give them another very good starting pitcher down the road.",-1
"Another projectable right-hander drafted by the ORGANIZATION out of high school, ORGANIZATION was a second round pick from GPE back in 2016. The ORGANIZATION knew it might take a while for the right-hander to figure things out and he had an up-and-down first two summers of pro ball. It looked like he was taking a major step forward in 2018 during his full-season debut, but September PERSON surgery will keep him out for all of the 2019 season.Thanks to some tweaks to his delivery, ORGANIZATION was having greater success in 2018 before he blew out his elbow. He was getting his fastball up to 96-97 mph and he was missing bats and getting ground-ball outs as he continued to improve his command of the pitch. He was still working to refine his secondary stuff, but he showed at least an average changeup and was throwing his breaking ball for strikes more frequently. His overall command within the strike zone was improving, as he went from a .339 batting average against in the GPE League in 2017 to a .237 BAA in the LOCATION League a year later.The ORGANIZATION hope ORGANIZATION can wipe the slate clean and start over in 2020. Once he shakes off the rust, there is confidence he can restart his upward trajectory toward a future in a big league rotation.",-1
"GPE PERSON had never had a first-round pick, despite counting two dozen big leaguers among its alumni, before 2018. PERSON, undrafted and relatively unrecruited as a ORGANIZATION high schooler, changed all that despite a somewhat up-and-down junior season. He had, however, reached double digits in home runs and steals as a sophomore, and hit 13 homers this spring after impressing with PERSON last summer. That was enough for the ORGANIZATION to take PERSON. 10 overall and give him $4.4 million to sign, just a tick below pick value. PERSON is an on-base machine thanks to his speed (which earns well-above-average grades from some evaluators) and patient approach. A left-handed hitter, he does swing and miss a bit much for a player with a leadoff profile, because he can get overly aggressive at times, especially against breaking pitches. Though PERSON didn't go deep in 64 at-bats with wood bats on PERSON, he packs some sneaky power in his athletic frame and could produce 20 or more homers per season in the big leagues.PERSON also uses his quickness well to steal bases and track down balls in center field. He throws better than most players at his position -- his fastball reached 92 mph when he was a high school pitcher -- and his makeup is another positive in his favor. The most common comparison is PERSON, though PERSON had less pop and more speed than PERSON at the same stage of his career.",-1
"PERSON was lightly recruited out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks, and after not being drafted, he headed to GPE. PERSON jumped on the radar with a huge sophomore year and performed well for PERSON that summer, building anticipation for his junior year in 2018. That turned out to be a bit inconsistent for the outfielder, though he did hit 13 home runs. The ORGANIZATION liked the overall resume enough to take him No. 10 overall, and he reached full-season ball in his debut summer.PERSON has the potential to have at least big league average tools across the board. The left-handed hitter has an incredibly patient approach, getting on base a ton, which should allow him to use his speed to his advantage frequently. There's a bit too much swing and miss at times, often offset by that walk rate, as he can get too aggressive at the plate. That was particularly true in 2018, when some felt he was trying to sell out for power too often. He does have the kind of raw pop that should allow him to naturally find the seats without taking him out of his gameplan at the plate.The speed that makes PERSON a basestealing threat also allows him to cover a lot of ground in center field, where he has every chance to stay long-term. He has a strong arm from the position to boot. PERSON's all-around tools and plus makeup should give him the chance to be an impact everyday center fielder in the big leagues.",-1
"PERSON spent his first two years of high school at a GPE prep school, then transferred back home to PERSON and reclassified as a senior for the 2019 Draft. One of the better athletes available, he became the highest position player ever drafted out of a ORGANIZATION State high school when the ORGANIZATION took him in the second round -- surpassing Tigers 1977 eighth-rounder PERSON -- and they lured him away from what had seemed to be a strong ORGANIZATION commitment with an above-slot bonus. PERSON offers a tantalizing combination of plus raw power, speed and arm strength. He also has run his fastball up to 93 mph and flashed a hard slider on the mound. He's a potential 20-20 center fielder if everything comes together, but he's also going to require a lot of time and patience with his development.Though PERSON makes loud contact when he connects at the plate, there are questions about his hitting ability and how well his raw power will translate into production. He has a big leg kick that he'll need to tone down and he may have to rework his right-handed swing. He must refine his reads and jumps to get the most out of his speed on the bases and in the outfield.",-1
"There have been a total of six players from the ORGANIZATION to make it to the big leagues, the most recent being PERSON in 2014. There's been an uptick of baseball talent coming from the island of late, however, with prospects like PERSON with the ORGANIZATION and PERSON making their way through systems. The ORGANIZATION were able to spend on the international market in 2017 for the first time in a long time, shelling out $1.2 million to sign PERSON to join Bahamians in the Minors.PERSON officially makes his debut in 2018 and immediately becomes the fastest player in the system, with pure 80 speed on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. He's already gotten bigger and taller in the last year and while he has a long way to go in terms of gaining strength, there could be plus raw power to unlock eventually. Then it will come down to his hit tool. He'll need to cut down on his swing some and refine his approach like any 17-year old, though he does have a decent idea of the strike zone at such a young age. There's also the potential to be an elite-level defender in center field, with plus range and a strong arm to boot.More than anything, PERSON just needs to go out and play so he can start sharpening his considerable tools. The ORGANIZATION think he's at the high end of the athleticism scale, in a top tier with 2017 first-rounder Jo Adell, and watching him develop should be an exciting storyline.",-1
"After signing PERSON for $8 million in 2014, the ORGANIZATION were prohibited from spending too much on any one player in the international market until the 2017 signing period. They jumped in by signing PERSON, a premium athlete from the GPE, for $1.2 million in early July.PERSON, who will make his pro debut in 2018, has tools to dream on. He is a plus runner who the ORGANIZATION think could warrant an 80 on the 20-80 scouting scale once he starts to mature. He'll need to add strength, but he has the kind of 6-foot-2 frame that should add it easily, allowing him to eventually grow into some power. The ORGANIZATION are already pleased with a better-than-expected approach at the plate. Once a shortstop, he's moved to center field, where he has the chance to be an outstanding defender with at least a Major League average arm.PERSON's ceiling is very high, though given PERSON's struggles, no one wants to be too bullish on him just yet. That said, his outstanding personality and plus makeup gives the ORGANIZATION hope he can one day fulfill his enormous potential.",-1
"GPE baseball is starting to make an impact on professional baseball in the States, with the D-backs' PERSON currently on the Top 100 Prospects list and PERSON reaching the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION' system. The ORGANIZATION scouted the island well prior to the start of the 2017-18 signing period, getting a pair of premium athletes in D'Shawn Knowles and PERSON, who got $1.2 million to sign. His professional, and GPE, debut in the Rookie-level PERSON showed that it's going to take time for PERSON's athleticism to translate into performance on the field.Though he struggled out of the gate, PERSON continues to be one of the best athletes in the organization. He has top of the scale speed, which should allow him to steal bases and cover a ton of ground as an above-average, if not eventually plus, center fielder. He's starting to add strength, which will help him impact the ball more after more than half of his balls in play last summer were on the ground. While his strikeout rate of over 35 percent seems alarming, he has shown signs of making good decisions at the plate. Most of the work he needs to do is mechanical. He's still understanding his swing and learning to have a consistent bat path.PERSON has pleased the organization with his willingness to ask questions and learn with an understanding he has a long way to go. With a whopping 44 games of professional game experience under his belt entering 2019, the most important thing will be for him to get as many reps as possible.",-1
"â¢ 7/17: PERSON promoted to Double-AORGANIZATION hitters who perform as juniors, particularly for big programs, always rise up ORGANIZATION boards. PERSON was a prime example of this, going from interesting bat to sure-fire first-round pick as he helped PERSON win the ORGANIZATION World Series. The ORGANIZATION liked his offensive profile enough to make him the 20th overall selection of the ORGANIZATION and after his long college postseason run, he turned in a solid pro debut, reaching full-season ball even though he was running out of gas.PERSON had shown an advanced approach at the plate and the ability to hit for average as a sophomore and in the ORGANIZATION, but took a huge step forward as a prospect when he added power to his resume thanks to some tweaks to his swing mechanics. The added power hasn't taken anything away from him potentially being a plus hitter, one who draws walks and doesn't strike out a ton, when all is said and done. PERSON's above-average arm works well from the outfield and he looked fine in right field during his debut, though some feel his below-average speed will land him left. In the end, though, it will be his bat that will carry him quickly through the system.",-1
"Coming off a strong Cape Cod League season last summer, PERSON stepped up in a big way during his junior season at FACILITY, picking up the slack when teammate PERSON went down with an injury. PERSON known as a strong hitter, he added power to his game, helping the ORGANIZATION win the ORGANIZATION World Series after being selected No. 20 overall by the ORGANIZATION, who eventually signed him for $2.55 million, $570,000 below pick value.PERSON had long been known for his advanced approach from the left side of the plate. He's not afraid to draw walks and makes consistent hard contact, always loving using the opposite field. PERSON had thought there was power to tap into and he did that this spring, reaching double-digit home runs. With a tick above-average arm, there's a chance PERSON could play right, though a lack of speed makes most feel left field is his likely long-term defensive home.Wherever he lands in the outfield, it's PERSON's bat that got him drafted in the first round by the ORGANIZATION. With his plate discipline and ability to drive the ball, he is the type of college performer who could move pretty quickly through PERSON's system.",-1
"ORGANIZATION burst onto the prospect scene by touching 95 mph at a January showcase, then continued to boost his stock with a strong spring. He dominated highly touted two-sport star PERSON in a March matchup and struck out 30 in a pair of playoff starts a month later. The ORGANIZATION selected him in the 11th round and signed him for $797,500, the equivalent of supplemental second-round money.ORGANIZATION usually works at 91-93 mph with running life on his fastball, and he should add velocity and hold it deeper into games as he gets stronger. His second-best pitch is a low-80s slider that can be solid but needs more consistency, and he also has a curveball with good depth. He has the makings of a decent changeup with some sink, and it should improve as he employs it more often in pro ball.Though ORGANIZATION's arm action is a bit long, he repeats his delivery well and doesn't have any problems throwing strikes. There are some concerns about his size, listed at what scouts believe is a generous 6-foot-2, and his lack of history against quality competition. But he's also just beginning to realize his potential and has the ingredients for a solid four-pitch mix.",-1
"ORGANIZATION, the cousin of former big leaguer PERSON, leapt onto the GPE radar with a strong performance on the summer showcase circuit, particularly the ORGANIZATION Games. While he wasn't quite as electric this spring as he was over the summer, his considerable upside, in a left-handed package, prompted the ORGANIZATION to draft ORGANIZATION with the ORGANIZATION. 13 overall pick, marking the second straight year the organization had selected a prep lefty in the first round after taking PERSON seventh overall in 2016. ORGANIZATION will show plenty of fastball, occasionally touching the mid-90s but more often than not pitching at 89-92 mph. His heater plays up because of his long arms, deception and very good command of the pitch. ORGANIZATION' secondary stuff is well behind his fastball, as he'll throw a slider and a curveball that tend to bleed together. Because he has trouble staying on top of his curve, some scouts believe he will likely be better off sticking to the slider at the next level. He also throws a changeup that is getting better and approaching average.ORGANIZATION' velocity comes naturally because he's athletic and because he has a sound and repeatable delivery, and the ORGANIZATION feel there's a lot more to unlock from his 6-foot-6 frame. Though he's likely to be brought along slowly to begin his career, ORGANIZATION shows the makings of becoming a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"The cousin of former big leaguer PERSON, PERSON showed his potential during a standout turn on the summer showcase circuit but featured less consistency during his senior campaign in the ORGANIZATION prep ranks. The ORGANIZATION ultimately nabbed him with the ORGANIZATION. 13 overall pick, marking the second straight year the organization had selected a prep lefty in the first round after taking PERSON seventh overall in 2016. PERSON never took the mound that summer because the ORGANIZATION opted to give him additional rest, but he pitched increasingly well as the 2018 season progressed after making his pro debut with PERSON in May. PERSON features an impressive fastball, one capable of reaching of the mid-90s but typically sits more in the low 90s. His heater plays up because of his long arms, deception and very good command of the pitch. The southpaw's secondary stuff is well behind his fastball, as PERSON will throw a slider and a curveball that tend to bleed together, with the former currently ahead of the latter. He has trouble staying on top of his curve, and some scouts believe he will likely be better off sticking to the slider at the next level. He also throws a changeup that is getting better and approaching average.Already plenty athletic with clean arm action and a repeatable delivery, the ORGANIZATION believe PERSON is just scratching the surface of his physical potential. He's been brought along slowly to begin his career, but PERSON has the profile to move relatively quickly as he attempts to achieve his ceiling of a mid-rotation starter.",-1
"After spending the 13th overall pick and $3.4 million to sign ORGANIZATION out of a GPE high school in 2017, PERSON opted to have him rest his arm that summer and didn't have him make his pro debut until late last May, when he had already turned 20. He posted an impressive 85/27 K/BB ratio in 72 2/3 innings in low Class A, but he also recorded a 5.82 ERA because he struggled with his secondary pitches. He's the cousin of former ORGANIZATION outfielder PERSON has an imposing presence at 6-foot-6 and a better fastball than most left-handed starters, working at 92-94 mph and touching 96 with deception and command. His advanced age for a high schooler and his lack of feel to spin a breaking ball concerned some clubs in the 2017 Draft, and the latter remains an issue because he has trouble staying on top of his curveball and it tends to blend together with his slider. His tumbling changeup also lacks consistency but could be his best secondary pitch in the long run.ORGANIZATION has plenty of raw talent but is only scratching the surface of his potential. He throws strikes but will have to refine the rest of his repertoire to keep hitters off his fastball. He has a chance to become a mid-rotation starter but will need plenty of development time to get there.",-1
"Taken in the fourth round of the 2015 Draft out of the GPE high school ranks, PERSON received nearly $250,000 above pick value to sign with the ORGANIZATION rather than go on to the ORGANIZATION of GPE. A lower back issue cut his Gulf Coast League debut short after 33 games.PERSON is somewhat similar to fellow 2015 draftee PERSON, a high school shortstop who has moved over to third as a pro. A good athlete who excelled in multiple sports in high school, PERSON has a quick bat from the left side of the plate that should allow him to hit for average. As he adds strength to his 6-foot-3 frame, there should be more power to come as well. There's work to be done at third, but he has the arm, hands and agility to profile well there. PERSON saw some time in left field during his pro debut and he could continue to get some reps there and at first, especially if he and Blankenhorn are at the same level simultaneously, something the ORGANIZATION might try to avoid for the time being.",-1
" One of the top high school players in GPE in 2015, PERSON's bat and ability to stay at third landed him in the fourth round, where the ORGANIZATION went almost $250,000 above pick value to sign him away from his commitment to the ORGANIZATION of GPE.With his sweet left-handed swing and sound approach, PERSON has the tools to hit for average. While he doesn't drive the ball consistently yet, he should in the future because he has a quick bat and plenty of room to add strength to his 6-foot-3 frame. A good athlete who saw time at shortstop and pitcher and also played basketball and football, PERSON profiles well at third base. He has a solid arm and a quick first step, though he'll need to refine his footwork at the hot corner, something that should come with pro instruction. He did see time at shortstop and in left field as well during his pro debut.",-1
"PERSON didn't see much mound time as a freshman at ORGANIZATION, so he transferred to PERSON back in his home state of GPE. After a strong season in the rotation, PERSON was considered to be one of the best ORGANIZATION players in the 2018 Draft class, landing in the fifth round and signing for an over-slot bonus of $450,000.Still more of a thrower than pitcher, PERSON has two plus power pitches at his disposal. He'll touch 97 mph with his fastball, which has cutting action to it, and his mid-80s slider is a wipeout pitch that misses bats when he's at his best. His changeup is well behind the other two pitches, and he'll have to work on it for him to have a chance to start. With a maximum-effort delivery and super-quick arm, PERSON's command will never be his forte, with future average control perhaps a dream at best.The ORGANIZATION might let PERSON start for now so he can get innings and work on his command and delivery. He likely profiles better as a one-inning short reliever that goes right after hitters with two plus pitches.",-1
"PERSON was a raw thrower with a dominant fastball coming out of the GPE high school ranks two years ago and after a freshman season that saw him make just three appearances at ORGANIZATION, he transferred to PERSON back in GPE. A very strong season in the rotation there sent his ORGANIZATION stock soaring, and he landed in the fifth round, signing for an above-pick value bonus of $450,000.PERSON has a very quick right arm that allows him to throw two power pitches that grade out as plus. His fastball sits in the 92- to 95-mph range and touches 97 with some cutting action. His mid-80s slider has late life and is a true wipeout pitch when he is at his best. His changeup needs work, a pitch he didn't use much and had a tendency to tip off when he did try to throw it. PERSON has the pure stuff to be a starting pitcher, but has work to do in terms of cleaning up his delivery and throwing strikes more consistently. He could be given every opportunity to show he can develop in that role, with the ORGANIZATION knowing his fastball-slider combination would work very well out of a bullpen.",-1
"The younger brother of PERSON outfielder PERSON, GPE is more advanced and more physical than his sibling at the same stage of their careers.

A switch-hitter, PERSON shows aptitude and power from both sides of the plate. He has the ability to hit for a high average with 15 or more homers per year, though his Cape struggles were a surprise after he batted .361/.464/.541 during a breakout sophomore season with the ORGANIZATION. He logged similar numbers as a junior, displaying a quick bat, good strength and a patient approach en route to a .335/.448/.557 batting line and 27 extra-base hits.Though PERSON has solid-to-plus speed, he's not always that fast out of the batter's box and is still learning to get the most out of his quickness on the bases and in the outfield. He played mostly right field in his first two years at ORGANIZATION before seeing more action in left field this spring, and he needs to improve his reads and routes. His arm is fringy at best, making him better suited for left field than right.",-1
"The younger brother of PERSON, GPE has the offensive tools to have a more meaningful big league career than his sibling. He starred in his final two seasons at ORGANIZATION, batting .350/.458/.548 with 17 homers and 19 steals in 116 games, though some scouts questioned his ability to hit with wood bats as well as his effort. Neither was an issue after the PERSON signed him for $645,000 in the third round last June, as he hit his way to Class A Advanced in his debut.A switch-hitter, PERSON has shown the ability to do damage from both sides of the plate. His hitting ability stands out a little more than his pop, and he has a quick swing, strong frame and patient approach. Though he has solid-to-plus speed once he gets going, he's not always that quick out of the batter's box and has had just middling success as a basestealer.PERSON's speed also doesn't play as well as hoped on defense. He played mostly on the corners for the ORGANIZATION because his reads and routes leave a lot to be desired, and profiles best in left field with his fringy arm. PERSON deployed him in center field for much of his pro debut and plans on introducing him to first base as well.",-1

He proved worthy of such an investment during an impressive pro debut that saw him reach the Rookie-level PERSON while slashing .311/.398/.559 with nine home runs at two stops.PERSON is an impressive athlete who shows the makings of five average-or-better tools. The right-handed power he showed during his debut, a product of his bat speed and strength, is PERSON's calling card. He stands to add even more pop by modifying his crouched stance and creating more leverage through the zone using his 6-foot-3, 210-pound frame. More than just a slugger, PERSON also shows natural hitting ability, recognizes pitches well and uses the whole field better than most players his age. An average runner, PERSON gets the most out of his speed, running the bases well and showing better-than-expected range in center field, where he spent much of his pro debut. While there's a non-zero chance of him sticking up the middle, most scouts peg him as a future right fielder on account of his strong, accurate arm. The sky is seemingly the limit for PERSON, and he has both the tools and accompanying skills to get there.",-1

More than just a slugger, he also has natural hitting ability, recognizes pitches well and uses the whole field.Though he's an average runner, PERSON gets the most out of his speed, running the bases well and showing better-than-expected range in center field.

He was a standout during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, slashing .311/.398/.957 with nine home runs, and continued to show a blend of hitting ability and power in his first full season, coming on strong after a slow start in the cold-weather ORGANIZATION. PERSON and strong, PERSON has a real chance of developing at least average tools across the board. His right-handed power is his calling card, and he tapped into it promisingly at ORGANIZATION A Wisconsin, totaling 49 extra-base hits including 13 home runs.

While his huge frame gives him a naturally long swing, he doesn't swing and miss excessively because he has feel for hitting and advanced plate discipline.Though he projects as a well below-average runner, PERSON moves well and is athletic for a 6-foot-4, 238-pounder. While it remains to be seen whether he can remain at third base, he enhanced his chances by improving his conditioning as a prep senior.

His 6-foot-4 frame comes with a naturally long swing, but he has no difficulty making repeated contact because his feel for hitting and his plate discipline are very advanced for a teenager. And that contact is loud contact, the product of bat speed, strength and leverage from the left side of the plate.For his size, PERSON moves well and is relatively athletic, though he projects as a well below-average runner. The ORGANIZATION have given him some time at third base and he has a strong arm that clocked low-90s fastballs when he pitched as an amateur, though most scouts think his size and lack of quickness will land him across the diamond.

"ORGANIZATION was dominant as a senior at ORGANIZATION (Fla.)

ORGANIZATION's prospect stock took flight in 2016 as he earned All-Star honors in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League before advancing to full-season ball at age 18, and he's emerged as top-flight pitching prospect this season behind a dominant showing with PERSON that earned him a spot in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON in July. A tall and lanky right-hander, ORGANIZATION offers an intriguing blend of present pitchability and physical projection. His velocity began to tick up last season as he consistently sat in the low 90s, and it's easy to envision him tacking on more as he gets stronger. ORGANIZATION's curveball, thrown with tight spin and loads of depth, flashes plus and nets him plenty of whiffs, and he shows a similarly advanced feel for throwing an above-average, fading changeup. ORGANIZATION throws everything on a downhill plane, and his above-average control and overall efficiency cause his entire arsenal play up.Despite being one of the youngest players in his GPE class, ORGANIZATION's solid foundation has allowed him to move relatively quickly through the ORGANIZATION, all while answering questions about his durability.

"Perhaps the most projectable pitcher in the 2015 Draft, ORGANIZATION was a 6-foot-5, 160-pound GPE high schooler who landed the largest bonus ($2,302,500) among prep arms that summer. The Indians have handled him carefully, limiting him to 95 1/3 innings in his first two pro seasons before turning him loose in 2017, when he was the Class A Advanced PERSON pitcher of the year and finished second in the Minors with 186 strikeouts. Forearm soreness delayed his 2018 debut until June, after which he looked like his usual dominant self, but he missed the first four months this year after straining his upper back during Spring Training.Though ORGANIZATION's fastball sits around 91-93 mph and tops out at 95, it projects as a plus pitch because he still has room to add more strength and velocity and because of his command, extension, angle and high spin rate. His curveball gives him a second plus offering, with good shape and spin rate to go with upper-70s velocity. His fading changeup helps him keep left-handers in check and grades as solid.ORGANIZATION's advanced feel for pitching stands out even more than his stuff.

"The GPE' 2016-17 international spree garnered notoriety for the money spent. But some of the best pieces from that class weren't high-bonus signings at all. PERSON is a perfect example. Named for the town of GPE, where he's from in GPE, PERSON signed for $320,000. He made his full-season debut by splitting time between the ORGANIZATION and short-season Class A Tri-City in 2018. PERSON batted .366/.450/.438, while showcasing some of the most advanced knowledge of the strike zone in the organization; he struck out 16 times and walked 30.PERSON is a slender and wiry middle-infield type, who needs to fill out his 6-foot frame. When he does, he could grow into some power. But his contact skills are the defining characteristic. PERSON's short left-handed stroke produces line drives all over the field, and he has a knack for hard contact. He complements his excellent plate approach with above-average speed, though he still needs to hone his base-stealing. Defensively, the GPE are convinced PERSON can remain at shortstop, and he's got the quick hands necessary to be a solid defender. His arm projects as merely average, and in a GPE system loaded with shortstop options, that could force a move to second base. But if his plate skills carry to the upper levels, PERSON could develop into a serious on-base threat as a bat-first middle infielder.",-1
"PERSON was a top-flight high school prospect in GPE in 2016, but removed his name from the ORGANIZATION because he wanted to pitch for the ORGANIZATION of GPE. He was a solid contributor for three years with the ORGANIZATION, though he never truly dominated, and pitched well enough as the school's top starter in 2019 to get drafted in the second round. PERSON signed for around $100K under pick value and pitched well, albeit briefly, in his pro debut in the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League.PERSON can display four pitches that earn solid or better grades at their best. As a starter, he works at 90-92 mph and reaches 94 with his fastball, creating some armside run with some crossfire in his delivery. He uses his high-three-quarters arm slot to stay on top of an upper-70s curveball that is often his best pitch, and he also can manipulate it into a harder, more lateral-breaking slider in the low 80s.PERSON also has at least an average changeup with some fade and did a much better job of throwing strikes in 2019, enhancing his chances of remaining a starter in pro ball. He has a high floor as a potential No. 4 starter with a fallback of becoming at least a seventh-inning reliever. He has reached 97 mph with his fastball coming out of the bullpen and could have a more consistent plus curveball in shorter stints.",-1

The ORGANIZATION took his bat in the third round, giving him almost $1.5 million to sign him away from his GPE commitment, more than twice the pick value.Strong and stocky, PERSON has shown an innate ability to barrel up the baseball, both at a number of elite-level events over the summer, as well as this spring, with an advanced approach from the left side of the plate. He has legitimate raw power he's already tapping into, hitting two home runs, along with a .528 average during PERSON's gold medal run. He's a better athlete than you might think, though he is a below-average runner. The big question surrounding PERSON is where he'll fit defensively. He does have the chance to stick at third, with enough arm and the bat to profile there, though some worry about his range. The ORGANIZATION announced PERSON as a second baseman when he was drafted, and he played there and the hot corner during his pro debut in the rookie-level GPE. Wherever he lands defensively, it's his bat that will allow him to climb the organizational ladder.",-1

A strong spring could have vaulted PERSON into that realm of this year's GPE, but the right-hander struggled and lost his spot in the ORGANIZATION' rotation. The ORGANIZATION saw untapped potential and value in PERSON for that very reason, so much so that they went nearly $150,000 over slot value to sign him after selecting him in the fourth round. PERSON still has plenty of power to go after hitters when he wants it. His fastball will touch 96-97 mph and he consistently reaches the mid-90s, but a lack of life led to him being hit hard this past spring when he threw it for a strike. He has struggled to throw his slider, which had flashed plus in the past, for a strike, and he hasn't been able to develop a reliable third pitch, so college hitters have been sitting on the fastball. He has a tendency to not drive through the ball and can be too rotational, giving hitters too good of a look at the ball coming out of his hand.Because of his struggles, some scouts had a hard time projecting PERSON as a starter going into the GPE. The ORGANIZATION, however, will give the right-hander the chance to do so in the pro ranks, with the hopes of fixing what's ailed him this spring. If he's unable to stick in the rotation, PERSON's fastball-slider combination could help him carve out a role as a setup type who can pitch the seventh or eighth inning.",-1

To do so, he'll need to tighten his strike zone.A good athlete for a 225-pounder, PERSON presently has average speed, but likely will slow down as he matures physically.

He has a strong 6-foot-3 frame and hit the ball harder than ever as a junior, showing enough pop to provide 15 homers per season.ORGANIZATION makes the most of his average to solid speed on the bases. He also has good instincts at shortstop, where he compensates for ordinary range with reliable hands and a strong, accurate arm.

He sends line drives to all fields and has a little pop from the right side of the plate. PERSON is an average runner who runs the bases well but isn't a threat to steal. Defensively, PERSON has a strong arm and good hands that allow him to profile anywhere on the field. His best chance at becoming a regular is at either second or third base, though it's probably more like that PERSON serves as a utility infielder.",-1
"One of the top high school hitters in LOCATION in 2017, PERSON passed up a strong commitment to PERSON to sign for $816,500 as a supplemental second-rounder. After a solid pro debut, he had a spectacular '18, topping the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in hitting (.352), runs (49), hits (95), doubles (29), extra-base hits (35) and total bases (138). He has the highest offensive ceiling among GPE's deep pool of young infielders, not to mention some of the best leadership ability and work ethic in the system. PERSON's elite bat-to-ball skills produce repeated line-drive contact from the right side of the plate. He has such advanced feel for hitting that he could develop close to average power once he adds more strength and drives the ball in the air more often. If there's a knock on his offensive game, it's that he puts the ball in play almost too easily, as he drew only eight walks in 301 plate appearances last year.PERSON's instincts also stand out on the bases and in the field, where he plays better than his average speed. He's an aggressive runner and proficient basestealer. He has sure hands and makes up for an average arm at shortstop with a quick release, though his tools may fit better at second base.",-1
"PERSON PERSON had seven players drafted in its history, none earlier than the sixth round and none since 2008. PERSON pushed the program's total to eight players in 2017 when the GPE made him the highest-drafted player in school history by taking him in the ORGANIZATION. 71 overall pick in the second ORGANIZATION. He signed for slot value, foregoing a commitment to PERSON Christian.A shortstop in high school, PERSON does have some range and a decent arm, but he tends to play too fast at the position, with many evaluators foreseeing a move to second at the next level. He has the chance to play there every day if his bat continues to develop. Early this spring, PERSON got away from his usual approach, adding a leg kick and trying to show he could hit for more power. When he's at his best, he's a high-contact, line-drive hitter, one who should grow into some power naturally in the future. While he's not a burner, he is an above-average runner, especially once underway.If PERSON can continue to swing the bat like he's capable, he could develop into a PERSON type. At worst, he becomes a PERSON type of utility man. At worst, he becomes a PERSON type of utility man.",-1
"The GPE made PERSON the highest-drafted player in GSP (Calif.) High history in 2017 when they took him with the ORGANIZATION. 71 overall pick in the second ORGANIZATION. After signing for slot value and forgoing a commitment to PERSON, PERSON impressed with his well-rounded game during a successful pro debut in the Rookie-level PERSON. The GPE targeted PERSON in the ORGANIZATION for his pure hitting ability and potential to stick at an up-the-middle position. He's a high-contact, line-drive hitter from the right side of the plate, one who should naturally grow into some power in the future. Though not a burner, he is an above-average runner, especially once underway.Defensively, PERSON shows range and a decent arm as a shortstop, with both tools playing up thanks to his strong instincts. But because his tools aren't overwhelming, many evaluators foresee a move to second down the line. Regardless of his future defensive home, PERSON's bat suggests the floor of a utility player who might perform his way into an everyday role.",-1
"The son of former No. 1 overall pick and current ORGANIZATION third-base coach PERSON, PERSON missed his high school junior season following PERSON surgery but recovered to become a supplemental first-rounder in 2015. Signed for $2 million, he held his own during his pro debut as the youngest regular in the Rookie-level PERSON (age 18) but played just one game in 2016. He hurt his hamstring in extended spring training, doubled in his first at-bat when he got back on the field in mid-August and reinjured his hamstring scoring two batters later.Taller and more athletic than his father, PERSON has a chance to hit for power and average. Growing up around the game has helped him develop advanced hitting skills for his age, as he works counts and presently tries to drive balls from gap to gap. He has bat speed and plenty of room to add strength on his 6-foot-4 frame, so home runs should come naturally once he adds some loft to his right-handed stroke.While there are few questions about his offensive potential, PERSON's long-term defensive home remains in question. The Rockies believe his actions, hands and arm could work at third base but have played him more at first base this year. Additionally, his below-average speed and average arm probably fit better at first base or on an outfield corner.",-1
"The son of former No. 1 overall pick and current ORGANIZATION third-base coach PERSON, PERSON missed his high school junior season while recovering from PERSON surgery but recovered to land an over-slot $2 million bonus as a supplemental first-rounder in 2015. He has had health issues in pro ball as well, missing almost all of 2016 with hamstring woes and two months last year with a wrist injury. He has made a successful jump to high Class A in 2018 but spent two stints on the disabled list with a quadriceps issue.Growing up around the game helped PERSON develop advanced hitting skills for his age. He already works counts well and focuses on driving balls from gap to gap rather than worrying about home runs. He has a quality right-handed swing with bat speed and should develop plenty of natural power once he gets stronger and adds some loft to his stroke.PERSON broke into pro ball at third base but given the organization's depth at the position (beginning with superstar PERSON), he saw more action at first base in 2017. The ORGANIZATION like his actions and hands at third base, but his below-average speed and average arm fit better at the opposite corner.",-1
"The son of former No. 1 overall pick and All-Star PERSON, PERSON bounced back from PERSON surgery that cost him his junior season of high school to become a supplemental first-rounder in 2015. Growing up around the game helped his transition into pro ball after he signed for $2 million, and he hit .265/.368/.386 as the youngest regular (age 18) in the Rookie-level PERSON last summer. A severe hamstring injury sidelined him for the first four months of this season.Taller and more athletic than his father was, PERSON is an advanced hitter for his age. He works counts and tries to drive the ball from gap to gap with a quick line-drive stroke. As he gets stronger and adds more leverage to his right-handed swing, he could hit 20 homers per season.Though some scouts believe PERSON will wind up on an outfield corner or at first base, the Rockies are confident he'll stick at third base. He has the actions, hands and arm to play at the hot corner, and they think he can improve his first-step quickness. He has below-average speed but good instincts on the bases.",-1
"Ever since signing with the ORGANIZATION as a supplemental first-round pick in 2015, PERSON has had bad luck with injuries. The son of former big leaguer PERSON missed nearly all of the 2016 season with hamstring issues, played in just 82 games in 2017 with a wrist injury and while he played well in the GPE League in 2018 and reached 100 games played for the first time in his career, a quad problem shelved him twice. He was due some good fortune and it came in the form of a minor PERSON injury that kept the top ORGANIZATION prospect from going to the ORGANIZATION, allowing PERSON to step in and win the league's batting title.PERSON has always shown the ability to hit for average. He has an advanced approach at the plate, showing a willingness to see pitches and a knack for barreling up the baseball. He drives the ball to the gaps and started to show his raw power in games more in 2018, though he's never one to sell out for home runs. A third baseman in high school and at the outset of his career, PERSON has seen more time at first than the hot corner, though he continues to get reps at both, including during his ORGANIZATION stint. He has good hands and actions that point to being a solid defender at first.The key for PERSON is simply to stay healthy. If he can do that, he can build off of his ORGANIZATION success and attack the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION system.",-1
"The son of former big leaguer, and ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick, PERSON, PERSON was taken ORGANIZATION. 38 overall by the Rockies in the 2015 GPE and was given an above-pick value bonus of $2 million.Fully recovered from 2013 PERSON surgery, PERSON's arm is a solid average tool from third. It does remain to be seen if he can stay there long-term, with some seeing a move to a corner outfield spot or perhaps to first base. While PERSON is a below-average runner, he's more athletic than you would think and runs much better underway. Whatever position PERSON plays, it will be his bat that will be his carrying tool. He was one of the more advanced high school hitters in his GPE class and his frame and pedigree say he's going to grow into a good amount of power. All of PERSON's skills play up because of what is universally lauded as his plus makeup, something that will certainly help him move up the ladder.",-1
"GPE school pitchers with premium arm strength always generate interest among scouts, especially in typical baseball hotbeds like GPE. But evaluators prefer to come in packages well above six feet tall. When a pitcher like PERSON, who is 5-foot-10, can crank it up velocity-wise, the enthusiasm often comes with a bit more caution. The ORGANIZATION liked what they saw and nabbed PERSON in the 13th round and went over the $125,000 threshold for picks after the 10th round, giving PERSON $547,500 to walk away from his commitment to the ORGANIZATION of GPE.While PERSON is undersized, he has compact strength and athleticism on the mound. And he has plenty of arm, consistently firing fastballs up to 94-95 mph this past spring. He'll also flash a solid slider that has good short break and he even has some feel for a changeup with some fade, though he didn't need to use it very often in high school. Like with many prep pitchers, he's more control over command, though he tends to find the strike zone fairly consistently.Because of his size, some wondered if PERSON will be durable enough to be a starter at the next level. His fastball-breaking ball combination likely would play up in a bullpen role, but the ORGANIZATION are a long way away from making that kind of decision. He'll develop as a starter and had pitched across two levels of rookie ball during his summer debut.",-1
"When ORGANIZATION' fastball crept into the low 90s during his senior season as a GPE high schooler in 2015, his ORGANIZATION stock rose as well, prompting the ORGANIZATION to sign him for an over-slot $160,000 as a 16th-rounder. He wasn't ready for full-season ball until 2017 and flunked his first test there with a 6.39 ERA in seven outings, but he fared well when he returned last year. He led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with 11 wins and finished third in the Minors in K/BB ratio (7.9) and fourth in walk rate (1.1 per nine innings).ORGANIZATION misses bats and generates a lot of groundouts thanks to the tail and sink on his fastball and changeup, and the downhill plane he creates with his 6-foot-5 frame also helps. He has made impressive strides with his changeup, which grades as his best pitch, though his low-90s heater plays just as effectively because he commands it so well. He'll show the makings of a solid curveball but it's not as reliable as his other offerings.While ORGANIZATION doesn't have sexy stuff, his ability to locate his pitches so well could make him a mid-rotation starter. He has an affinity for pitching to hitters' weaknesses, and scouts inside and outside the organization love his makeup. There's still some projection remaining in his big, athletic frame, so it's possible he could add more velocity.",-1
"Heading into his 2015 senior season at ORGANIZATION Prep (ORGANIZATION, GPE), scouts viewed PERSON as a classic projection arm who would be best off with some development time in college. Once his fastball velocity surged from the upper 80s to the low 90s, however, the ORGANIZATION paid him $160,000 in the 16th round to buy him away from his commitment to ORGANIZATION JC of GPE Manatee-Sarasota.PERSON has an athletic 6-foot-5, 200-pound frame and a loose, quick arm that works extremely well. He currently operates at 91-94 mph with downhill plane plus tail and sink on his fastball, and he should continue to add velocity as he gets stronger. Both his slider and changeup are works in progress with the potential to become average or better offerings as he gains experience.PERSON' athleticism and easy delivery should enable him to throw plenty of strikes. While he's a project who will need time to develop, his ceiling is higher than most of the starters in the GPE system.",-1
"ORGANIZATION' fastball jumped from the high 80s to the low 90s during his senior season as a GPE high schooler in 2015, spurring the ORGANIZATION to lure him away from a commitment to ORGANIZATION JC of GPE Manatee-Sarasota with a $160,000 bonus in the 16th round. He finally graduated to full-season ball at the start of the 2017 season but got demoted after recording a 6.39 ERA in seven outings. He righted himself in his return to the short-season LOCATION, where he finished second in strikeouts (78 in 73 innings) and ORGANIZATION (1.22).ORGANIZATION still is figuring out how to get the most out of his tall, athletic frame and loose, quick arm. He works from 90-94 mph with his fastball, inducing groundouts with its tail and sink along with the downhill plane his size creates. His curveball and changeup are becoming solid pitches but lack consistency at times.While ORGANIZATION has had no problem throwing strikes, his command isn't nearly as advanced as his control, making him fairly hittable in the early stages of his career. PERSON knew he would need time to develop and is willing to give it to him because he remains one of the more projectable starting pitching prospects in the system.",-1
"PERSON was set to attend PERSON before the ORGANIZATION took a flier on him in the 34th round of the 2015 Draft and then lured him away from his college commitment with a $400,000 bonus. He made a strong impression last summer during his brief pro debut by not allowing an earned run over 13 1/3 innings in the ORGANIZATION, and that success continued in 2016 at ORGANIZATION A Short PERSON, where he was the team's Opening Day starter as well as a GPE York-Penn League All-Star.PERSON's fastball operates in the low 90s and bumps 93 mph, and scouts expect him to continue to add velocity as he grows into his tall, lanky frame. He has present feel for locating his heater to all quadrants of the strike zone, while his downhill plane helps him to generate plenty of weak contact and ground balls. PERSON's curveball is his best secondary offering, thrown with tight spin and good downer action, and he made strides in developing his changeup in 2016.At 6-foot-5, 200 pounds, PERSON already possesses outstanding size for a player his age, with considerable physical projection remaining. Though his stuff isn't overpowering, the left-hander's size and feel for pitching has the ORGANIZATION excited about his future.

"PERSON consistently smoked the ball at the ORGANIZATION Games last August and at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship two months later, establishing himself as one of the best high school hitters in the 2016 Draft. He was bothered by a shoulder injury in the spring, which made him tricky for scouts to evaluate and ultimately caused him to the sixth round, where the Indians were able to land him at pick value for $270,300.When healthy, PERSON has a quick, compact right-handed swing and barrels balls with ease. He has good balance at the plate and recognizes pitches and manages the strike zone better than most prep hitters. He has some strength too and could have average or better power.PERSON has a strong arm, but his hands, quickness and athleticism leave something to be desired. He does work hard and perhaps could become an adequate third baseman, but a move down the defensive spectrum to first base would make for a less attractive overall profile, not to mention one that will be harder to achieve as he ascends the ORGANIZATION ladder.",-1
"Ranked No. 15 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 international prospects class in 2016, PERSON was part of the ORGANIZATION' aggressive spending in that market when the July 2 signing period began. Signed at age 16 out of GPE, PERSON received $1.5 million as GPE PERSON blew past its international spending pool.The investment in PERSON is all about his power potential. The right-handed hitter might have had the most raw power of any member of the international prospect class in 2016. He can put on a show during batting practice and hit balls out of the park to all fields. He'll need to refine his approach and improve his pitch recognition in order to tap into that power consistently in games, but evaluators think he'll eventually be a solid all-around hitter. PERSON has an average arm and enough range to man an outfield corner.Regardless of where he plays, the hope is PERSON will eventually develop into a run-producing, middle-of-the-lineup type of player.",-1
"The sons of legendary GPE outfielder PERSON both defected from the island in May 2018 and signed with the ORGANIZATION five months later, with PERSON receiving a $5.25 million bonus and PERSON Jr. landing $1 million. Five years younger and less athletic than his brother, a member of ORGANIZATION's Top 100 Prospects list, PERSON Jr. may have a higher offensive ceiling. He led PERSON's 18-and-under league in hitting (.440), on-base percentage (.560) and slugging (.667) in his final season before defecting.A switch-hitter growing up, PERSON will bat solely left-handed in his first season in the GPE. He has a fluid swing and advanced bat-to-ball skills, leading to optimism that he'll be a quality hitter. He shows the ability to backspin the ball and while most of his present power comes to his pull side, he has the potential to drive the ball to all fields.PERSON has average speed and outfield range, so he fits best on a corner. He has solid arm strength and likely will end up in right field. More outgoing than his brother, he's a brash player who displays plenty of confidence, though his youth means PERSON won't rush him.",-1
"The 2016-17 international signing period has been a solid one for the ORGANIZATION thus far, highlighted by the emergence of top 10 prospect PERSON. PERSON top 30 prospect PERSON also came in that haul and now they are joined by PERSON, who signed for $150,000 in November 2016 and has used his command and feel for pitching to join PERSON as teenaged rotation-mates in full-season Lakewood in 2019.None of PERSON' individual pitches jump off the page, but his ability to use any of his three pitches when he wants allows them all to play up. Velocity-wise, his fastball is below average, but his plus command of it to go along with solid life allow it to play close to average. His changeup is his best secondary offering, an offspeed pitch with splitter-like action to it and he throws his average slider for strikes consistently.Because of the lack of premium stuff, PERSON' ceiling might be limited. But his advanced pitchability -- he's walked roughly one batter per nine innings in his career to date -- gives him the chance to stick in the back end of a big league rotation.",-1
"Sub-six foot high school right-handers are a little tough to evaluate, especially when they have a reliever profile. But the 5-foot-11 PERSON had opened eyes with his arm strength as the 2018 PERSON approached.

After a brief pro debut in the ORGANIZATION last year, he made a successful leap to full-season ball in 2019, almost exclusively as a reliever.Now listed at 6-foot, PERSON might be undersized, but he certainly doesn't lack arm strength. He has a live fastball that sits in the low-90s, but often touches 95-96 mph. He complements that with a slider that flashes above-average and he gets swings-and-misses along with ground-ball outs with his two-pitch repertoire. While he isn't tall, he does have a strong build, reminding some in the organization of PERSON in terms of body type. While he doesn't have pinpoint command, he's around the plate enough to be successful.PERSON entered pro ball a bit raw, but has already taken solid steps forward in terms of his development. He's shown the ability to pitch multiple innings and could be a solid middle reliever or even a setup type if he continues to progress.",-1

That's the only fast transition PERSON has made so far as his tools have taken a while to percolate, spending three summers in the ORGANIZATION before getting to the GPE briefly in 2016 and making his full GPE debut in the Rookie-level GPE League in 2017. He struggled in a move to the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in 2018.When he first arrived in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON did show off some considerable tools, finishing in the top 10 in the ORGANIZATION in slugging percentage and ORGANIZATION while also swiping 11 bases. Still maturing physically, PERSON has shown that he is already capable of impacting the baseball, with most of his power coming to his pull side thus far. There is concern that PERSON will hit enough to tap into that power as he moves up given a very high strikeout rate a summer ago, but the ORGANIZATION feel he'll make the adjustments with his setup at the plate to improve his hit tool.PERSON's plus speed will continue to make him a basestealing threat and give him enough range to play center field.

He does have the bat speed and strength to get to at least average power once he learns to lift and turn on pitches more frequently. PERSON moves well and was an excellent defender at first base. As a pitcher, he touched the low 90s with his fastball, giving him a stronger arm than your typical first baseman, perhaps a reason why the PERSON sent him out to play left field during his pro debut.Whether PERSON can stick in an outfield corner remains to be seen, but the Cardinals know he can easily slide back to first if needed.

Playing against considerably older competition, he produced a .351/.418/.587 line with 11 home runs in 61 games and led the circuit with 85 hits and 57 RBIs.GPE's robust production during his pro debut reflects his high offensive ceiling. He consistently impacts the baseball from both sides of the plate, showing a combination of bat speed, strong wrists/hands and elite bat-to-ball skills that leads some scouts to project him as a plus-plus hitter. He should offer above-average over-the-fence power, too, especially from the left side of the plate, from where he hit all but one of his home runs in 2018. GPE's approach, much like his physical tools, is advanced beyond his years, and he receives raves for his ability to recognize spin and control the zone. In the field, GPE has impressed evaluators with his hands, range and actions at shortstop, not to mention the high level of confidence he exudes. He could outgrow the position and shift over to second or possibly third base, though such a move would do little to detract from his All-Star-caliber ceiling.

Those qualities should enable PERSON to hit for a high average, and with considerable physical development ahead of him, he's merely scraping the surface of his power potential.

He wasn't able to repeat that performance in 2018 as a torn labrum in his non-throwing shoulder forced him to miss the 2018 season.When healthy, PERSON has shown an outstanding feel to hit and an ability to make consistent hard contact to all fields. He is continuing to refine his approach at the plate, but he has drawn walks and there is confidence he'll cut his strikeout rate as he figures things out, to the point where some feel he could be a plus hitter in time. As he physically matures, he should be able to use his bat speed to tap into considerable raw power as well. While he still has some growing to do, he has all the skills needed to be a long-term shortstop. How that will work with PERSON and PERSON in front him remains to be seen, but for now, his focus will be on getting reps and staying healthy in the lower levels of the ORGANIZATION' system.",-1
"After giving PERSON, GPE. 12 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list in 2015, a franchise record $4 million bonus, the Twins were excited to see this talented infielder get his career started in the ORGANIZATION last year. A hamstring injury kept that from happening for the most part, as PERSON appeared in just nine games, but he was able to make his GPE debut in the GPE League in 2017. GPEw back to full speed, PERSON can start showing off all of his considerable tools. He has shown the ability to make consistent hard contact with plus bat speed, and many think he could be an above-average hitter with more reps and perhaps even above-average power as he continues to add strength. He is more than athletic enough to stay at shortstop, perhaps even if he grows some more, and could follow in the footsteps of other big shortstops who stuck there. There's still a very long way for PERSON to go before he lives up to his ceiling or the expectations that can come with a $4 million price tag. The first order of business is staying on the field. If that happens, the tools should take care of the rest.",-1
"There was obvious excitement when the ORGANIZATION aggressively pursued PERSON, one of the top prospects in the 2015-16 international class, and signed him for $4 million in July 2015. Since then, however, there have only been glimpses of what he can do. The talented infielder missed most of his first summer, in 2016, because of a hamstring injury, then re-set a high bar by being one of the best prospects in the GPE League in his GPE debut in 2017. PERSON was halted when a torn labrum in his non-throwing shoulder kept him off the field for all of 2018.Because the injuries have limited his time on the field, PERSON is a bit of a wild card. Once he can shake the rust off, there is confidence he'll once again show his considerable offensive upside. He makes consistent hard contact with a natural feel to hit and while as a young player without that many reps, he'll need to refine his approach. He does work counts and draw walks. As he fills out, his bat speed and potential plus hitting tool could lead to at least average power. Fortunately, PERSON's injury wasn't to his throwing shoulder, so his plus arm should be just fine. Whether he outgrows the position remains to be seen.With a clean bill of health and no setbacks from his injury, PERSON should be ready to show what he can do over the course of a long season. Getting at-bats and reps in the field is priority number one for now.",-1
"The PERSON thought highly enough of PERSON, who was ranked No. 12 on MLB.com's Top 30 international prospects list heading into the July 2 signing period, and his five-tool potential that they went over their international pool amount by giving him a $4 million bonus to sign, more than PERSON paid to bring PERSON into the fold.He may be far away, but PERSON has a ton of potential and ceiling. With plus bat speed and strength, he has considerable raw power. He's shown ability to hit in games, with very good bat-to-ball skills, something that will only improve with pro instruction and consistent reps. There's the chance for him to have above-average hit-and-power tools when all is said and done. A very good athlete, he's already added good strength since signing. Some feel he'll eventually outgrow shortstop, but the PERSON feel he'll be able to stay there, in the body mold of bigger shortstops like PERSON, PERSON or, more recently, PERSON. He has good defensive actions and a strong throwing arm.The PERSON won't rush their investment, with a plan to let him get started in the ORGANIZATION and come to the GPE for instructional league play in the fall.",-1
"Not every successful international signing has to be a seven-figure expenditure. If the early returns are any indication, PERSON, who signed for $550,000 in July 2016 out of the ORGANIZATION, will be one of those bargain finds. He showcased natural hitting ability during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION and firmly put himself on the prospect radar in 2018, ascending three levels to finish the season as an 18-year-old in the Class A ORGANIZATION. With his plus bat speed, barrel control and a clean swing from both sides of the plate, PERSON shows many of the attributes needed to hit for a high average. He covers the plate well, too, trusting his approach to let pitches travel deep and open up his use of the entire field. He projects for more gap power than true over-the-fence pop, but there's enough raw power and physical projection remaining to think he could produce double-digit homers in his prime. PERSON's loudest tool is plus speed that shows up in all facets of the game. He gets out of the box and down the line well and is aggressive on the basepaths, at times to a fault. Those wheels, along with his overall athleticism, translate well at shortstop, where he profiles as an above-average defender with the necessary hands, actions and arm strength to stick at the position long term. PERSON's lack of power limits his ceiling, but the pieces are there for him to develop into a glove-first regular up the middle.",-1
"PERSON was the ORGANIZATION. 26 prospect on ORGANIZATION's list of the Top 30 international prospects and had reportedly agreed to sign with the ORGANIZATION for $1.3 million before an arm injury led to a voided deal. The D-backs went on to sign him in October, 2017, and he impressed the organization with his development and overall performance the following summer at age 17 in the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION native is extremely athletic with a projectable body and the potential to have plus tools across the board. He showed an advanced approach during his pro debut, and he's poised to start impacting the ball more consistently as he adds strength and gains experience. A decent runner, PERSON has the potential to be a base-stealer and profiles well in center field, where he has impressed scouts with his defensive actions and range. He has plenty of arm strength for the position and could probably play all three outfield positions if needed.The D-backs have been very impressed with PERSON's athleticism and by how quickly he's added size and strength since entering their system. He'll need a lot of time to develop, but the final product could be a tooled-up center fielder who hits for power as well as average.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION spent more than $17 million during the 2014-15 international signing period, handing out seven-figure bonuses to seven different position players. PERSON, who signed for $1.35 million out of GPE, has been the most impressive among that group to date. He had no problems transitioning to the GPE at age 17 during his 2015 pro debut.While he was having a rough encore in the GPE, he still was showing some ability to control the strike zone and use the entire field from both sides of the plate. PERSON strong for his age, he has the bat speed and projectable frame to perhaps grow into average power once he matures physically.Though some scouts questioned PERSON's long-term ability to remain at shortstop when he signed, GPE has no such concerns. He has plus speed and arm strength, and his hands and feet work well on defense.",-1
"It looked as though GPE might become the third PERSON (ORGANIZATION, Ga.) product Drafted in the first round, following PERSON (2001) and PERSON (2012). Though he didn't end up going quite that high, GPE, the best defensive catcher in the 2018 Draft, still earned a selection in the ORGANIZATION B Round (ORGANIZATION. 69 overall) and signed for $1.8 million, nearly twice the recommended value for his slot, to forego his commitment to Vanderbilt.GPE's signature tool is his well-above-average arm strength, and he gets the most out of it with a quick transfer and fine accuracy on his throws. His receiving and framing skills are solid, and he's agile behind the plate. He also exhibits the desired leadership skills for his position.While his defense overshadows his offense and he struggled at times on the showcase circuit last summer when he tried to do too much, GPE offers some upside with the bat as well. With his strong build, solid bat speed and loft in his right-handed swing, he has at least above-average raw power. He didn't shown as much feel for the barrel during the spring as he has in the past, so it's unclear how much he'll be able to tap into his average raw power.",-1
"The most polished high school defensive catcher in the 2018 Draft, GPE made a case to become the third PERSON (ORGANIZATION, Ga.) product selected in the first round, following PERSON (2001) and PERSON (2012). PERSON grabbed him with a supplemental second-round choice and paid him a $1.8 million bonus (nearly twice his slot value at ORGANIZATION. 69) to sway him away from GPE's signature tool is his well-above-average arm strength, which he enhances with a quick release and accuracy on his throws. His receiving skills are advanced and smooth. A natural leader, he impressed teammates in his pro debut and has taken to learning GPE so he can better communicate with all of his teammates, especially the pitchers. Though he's considered a defense-first catcher and struck out in 29 percent of his plate appearances during his first taste of pro ball, GPE offers some upside at the plate. He has good bat speed and impacts the baseball, but he tends to get overly aggressive and his right-handed swing gets long. The question is how patient the ORGANIZATION will be with his hitting before advancing him to the upper levels after they sent him to low Class A at age 18 last summer.",-1
"PERSON endeared himself to scouts with his loud tools while playing for ORGANIZATION's gold medal-winning squad in the 18U World Cup in GPE. As a senior, he batted .454 with eight home runs and 41 ORGANIZATION and led The ORGANIZATION to a GPE 3-A championship, the ORGANIZATION' first title since 1975. Targeting offensive upside, the GPE selected PERSON, a Duke commit, with the ORGANIZATION. 14 overall pick in June, and then saved nearly $500,000 by signing him for $2.5 million. He struggled at times in the ORGANIZATION during his pro debut but still showed the ability to impact games in a variety of ways, finishing second on the team in doubles (10), home runs (6), walks (22) and stolen bases (10).PERSON's bat speed and strength give him well-above-average raw power from the left side of the plate, and he already shows the ability to get to it during games. He's at his best when he stays short to the ball and uses the whole field, and the GPE have worked to get him into a better position to hit. And while strikeouts may always be a part of his game, PERSON impressed club officials during his pro debut with his ability and willingness to coax walks.PERSON is a standout athlete with slightly above-average speed, although he's likely to lose a step or two as he fills out physically. It's also why PERSON, a center fielder in high school, is best suited to play right field in pro ball, where he profiles as an average defender with a plus arm. PERSON has the tools to develop into a middle-of-the-order hitter, but he may require extra time to refine his skills in the ORGANIZATION.",-1
"It's almost impossible to discuss PERSON with a scout and not have PERSON's name come up as a comparison. They're both Atlanta-area high school prospects, left-handed hitters with similar builds at the same stage of their careers and outstanding athletes for their size. As a senior, PERSON batted .454 with eight home runs and 41 ORGANIZATION and led The ORGANIZATION to a GPE 3-A championship, the ORGANIZATION' first title since 1975. Targeting offensive upside, the GPE selected PERSON, a Duke commit, with the ORGANIZATION. 14 overall pick in June, and then saved nearly $500,000 by signing him for $2.5 million.PERSON's bat speed and strength give him well-above-average raw power, and the fact that he's more aggressive than PERSON bodes well for PERSON's chances of tapping into it. He's at his best when he uses a short stroke, though he falls into the trap of trying to do too much at times. He hasn't had a great spring with the bat but still has enough offensive upside and all-around potential to go in the first round.A solid runner, PERSON led the GPE 18-and-under team with four steals in 14 games during the summer, and he swiped 11 more bags during the spring. Though he played center field in high school, PERSON is best suited to play right field in pro ball, and has the required arm strength for the position. He also has experience at first base.",-1
"PERSON excited scouts with his size and power/speed combination leading up to the 2016 Draft, earning comparisons to PERSON as an Atlanta-area high schooler with a similar build and athleticism. After signing for an under-slot $2.5 million as the 14th overall pick that June, he hit just .201/.329/.409 in his first three pro seasons. He led the Class A ORGANIZATION with 22 homers and ranked third with 82 walks in 2018, but his .180 batting average was the second-lowest among full-season batting qualifiers in the Minors.PERSON offers massive raw power, the product of a quick bat, prodigious strength and the leverage in his 6-foot-5 frame. He's also extremely selective at the plate, able to recognize offspeed pitches and refrain from chasing them out of the strike zone. But there are mechanical and timing issues with his left-handed swing, resulting in way too many swings and misses at hittable strikes.If PERSON can solve his hitting issues, he would have some of the highest upside in the system. He's very athletic for his size, displaying solid speed and a plus arm. He has the tools to be an asset in right field, though he needs to smooth out some rough edges first.",-1
"PERSON starred at ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, Ga.), going 13-0 as a junior in 2015 and winning the clincher in the GPE state 6-A championship series that also wrapped up the ORGANIZATION. 1 national ranking. His talent dictated that he would have gone in the top five rounds of the 2016 Draft, but he fell to the ORGANIZATION in the 35th because he was set on attending PERSON and becoming part of college baseball's top recruiting class. After two years as a reliever, he fared well as the ORGANIZATION' ORGANIZATION. 1 starter and landed in the fifth round to the ORGANIZATION, who signed him for full pick value.PERSON excels at pitching to contact with a 91-93 mph fastball that tops out at 95, creating ground balls and awkward swings with sink and the extension in his low-three-quarters delivery. His low-80s slider can be a solid offering when he stays on top of it, though it also can get sweepy and slurvy at times. His fading changeup similarly varies between effectiveness and inconsistency.Strong and durable, PERSON does a nice job of repeating his simple mechanics. He doesn't overpower hitters but he puts his pitches where he wants and limits damage done by walks or home runs. He might have a somewhat limited ceiling, but he's a fairly safe bet to become at least a back-of-the-rotation starter.",-1
"GPE was one of the most improved players in the LOCATION last year and continued to hit with wood bats in the ORGANIZATION. His all-around game gave hm a chance to become the first position player taken in the first round out of GPE since PERSON went 15th overall in 2001, but his awful first half of his junior season at the plate confounded scouts and he ended up dropping to the fifth round of the 2019 Draft. He did get $575,000, third-round money, to sign with the ORGANIZATION before starting his career in the Rookie-level Appalachian League.His offensive profile is different than that of most shortstops in that GPE's power stands out more than his hitting ability. He has an unconventional right-handed swing and an overly aggressive approach, but his bat speed and deceptive strength give him surprising pop for his size and position. When he was struggling, he was spread out too much in his stance, slowing his bat and creating holes in his swing. He has plus speed but still is learning how to turn it into stolen bases.GPE's quick hands work well in the field. He still can smooth some things at shortstop, but he covers ground and has the solid arm to make all the necessary throws. He needs more offensive and defensive refinement than a typical college prospect but has the upside of an up-the-middle guy with 20-20 potential if he can recapture his 2018 swing.",-1
"As a high school junior, PERSON hit an extra-inning home run to give PERSON (GPE) the 2015 Missouri state Class 3 baseball championship, but he otherwise drew little attention at his small-town school. After a modest freshman season at ORGANIZATION, he made a run at the Big East Conference triple crown in 2018 and continued to produce in the ORGANIZATION during the summer. A streaky junior campaign cost him a chance to join PERSON (ORGANIZATION. 13 overall in 1992) as the only ORGANIZATION position players ever selected in the first round, though he still came off the board early when the ORGANIZATION took him in the fourth round. PERSON's ORGANIZATION is one of the toughest places to hit a home run in college baseball, yet it wasn't able to contain PERSON, whose short, quick left-handed stroke and strength made him one of the better college sluggers in his class. He lets his home runs come naturally rather than swinging for the fences, making repeated contact that could allow him to hit for average as well. To do so, scouts believe he'll need to get more upright in his stance like he was in the past before getting too spread out as a junior.PERSON has below-average speed out of the batter's box but is closer to average once he gets going. He needs to improve his defensive instincts, and his arm is merely average, so he could eventually shift to left field in pro ball after playing right field at ORGANIZATION. Regardless of which outfield corner he winds up at, PERSON has the requisite pop to fulfill the profile.",-1
"An unheralded 20th-round pick as an ORGANIZATION high schooler by the Phillies in 2015, PERSON finally broke out when he made his full-season debut in '18. After ranking second in the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION in GPE (2.06) and ORGANIZATION (0.98), he went to the ORGANIZATION along with PERSON and right-hander PERSON in exchange for J.T. Realmuto in February. PERSON reportedly considered PERSON and PERSON the two best pitching prospects in GSP's system.PERSON's fastball velocity has been down 2-3 mph in his first season in the ORGANIZATION system, as he has worked at 89-91 mph with plus movement. His low-three-quarters delivery creates a lot of sink and run on his heater, leading to a lot of weak contact -- his 2.4 groundout/flyout ratio ranked fifth in the Minors last year. He shows aptitude for throwing his slider and changeup for strikes, though neither projects as more than an average offering at this time.While PERSON significantly improved his command and control in 2018, he still didn't miss a ton of bats, and he hasn't located his pitches as well this year. Whether his sinker-heavy approach will remain as effective against more advanced hitters remains to be seen. If it does, he could blossom into a No. 4 starter.",-1
"Signed for $100,000 in 2015 after the ORGANIZATION drafted him in the 20th round out of the ORGANIZATION prep ranks, PERSON made steady progress early in his career before breaking out in '18 during his first full season. Spending the entire year at ORGANIZATION A PERSON, PERSON finished second in the LOCATION League in both ERA (2.06) and ORGANIZATION (0.98). His performance caught the attention of the ORGANIZATION, as they acquired PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and international pool money in exchange for J.T. Realmuto in early February.PERSON pitches with average velocity, sitting at 89-93 mph and bumping 94 with a fastball that has plus movement. Working from a lower arm slot, PERSON generates a ton of sink and running action on his heater and induces ground balls at an elite rate -- his 62 percent ground-ball rate with PERSON was the fourth-best mark among qualified Minor League hurlers. He has good feel for throwing both a slider and changeup, giving him a pair of average-or-better secondary offerings, and he's adept at pounding the zone with his entire arsenal.PERSON looks the part of a future backend starter because he's naturally deceptive, has three solid pitches and throws a lot of strikes. If that doesn't work out, the left-hander should have no problem carving out a role in a big league bullpen based on his knack for generating weak contact on both sides of the plate.",-1
"The 2019 PERSON featured a solid number of college shortstops who were considered first-round candidates. PERSON didn't have as many tools or as high a ceiling as some, but he did come with a high floor as a steady up-the-middle defender with surprising power. After homering 31 times over two years at FACILITY, he became the second Wolfpack shortstop to get selected in the first round, following 2014 draftee PERSON. PERSON signed for just under $3.4 million, almost $500,000 below pick value, and made his pro debut in the Rookie-level PERSON League.Though he's not physically imposing, PERSON has quick hands and deceptive strength that give him at least above-average raw power. A right-handed hitter, he has a knack for putting the barrel on the ball. He shows the ability to hit for average and power, and he has done a better job of drawing walks this spring despite his aggressive approach.The biggest knock on PERSON is his below-average speed. Most big league shortstops run better than that, though some scouts think he can stay at the position because he has quick actions and hands. Others believe his speed and average arm will land him at second base, where he played as a freshman and still would profile well offensively. He saw time on both sides of second base during his pro debut.",-1
"The younger brother of GPE catcher PERSON, PERSON has shown some of the same tools as his brother as he's started his pro career. Signed back in February 2015, he's moved one station at a time, making his GPE debut in 2016 after starting in the ORGANIZATION, then showing good progress in a step up to the Rookie-level Appalachian League in 2017.While he might not be quite as dynamic as his brother, PERSON is an athletic backstop with intriguing skills on both sides of the ball. He has a strong arm and agility that helps him with blocking and receiving. He runs well for a catcher and has shown a solid approach at the plate, with a solid walk rate and the ability to hit the ball hard to all fields. He might jump on a first-pitch fastball for a home run in one at-bat, then lace a two-strike double to right-center in the next. He can get wild with his swing at times, and while he takes aggressive hacks at breaking stuff, he's also shown an ability to recognize spin.Bloodlines are always a plus, and there are similarities to his brother in many facets of the game. PERSON has the chance to be an everyday catcher, but he has a long way to go to get there.",-1
"Having ORGANIZATION bloodlines can be a very good thing. And there's no question that ORGANIZATION, the younger brother of GPE catcher PERSON, has some of the attributes that have made his older brother a big league regular. While ORGANIZATION the younger had a very successful first taste of full-season ball as a GPE ORGANIZATION All-Star in 2018, there's also been the flip side of that bloodlines coin, where he's fallen into the trap of believing he can do everything his more established sibling can.ORGANIZATION has all of the tools to be a very successful all-around catcher at the big league level. While he is a bit of a free swinger and sometimes attacks pitches out of the zone more than he should, he has shown the ability to make hard contact and draw walks while relatively limiting his strikeouts. He's starting to come into a little more power as he learns what he needs to adjust at the plate, and the ORGANIZATION were pleased that he was making those adjustments in his offseason work. Defensively, he's always had a strong arm and has plenty of agility to be a good blocker and receiver. The biggest thing ORGANIZATION needs to learn is that there is a process to becoming a finished product behind the plate, like his brother. As he starts to buy into building the foundation of being able to be a complete receiver, and not think he's already like his older brother, the more he'll be able to develop into the big league starter the ORGANIZATION envision.",-1
"Having players both pitch and hit is becoming a bit of a trend in baseball these days. The ORGANIZATION, for example, have a pair doing it in the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION, of course, made the biggest splash with signing PERSON prior to the 2018 season. But they have two others down on the farm, with PERSON approaching in the upper levels and GPE, an athletic Detroit high schooler who got an over-slot bonus of $700,000 in the fifth round of last June's GPE, just getting started.Scouts did like GPE on the mound a bit better leading up to the GPE, where his 6-foot-4 projectable frame and arm strength stand out. He can get his fastball up to 95 mph and sit in the low 90s, with more velocity to come as he matures. His secondary stuff shows glimpses, with his changeup better than his breaking ball, but it's all raw. As a hitter, he runs well and there's some raw power to tap into as he refines his approach at the plate.The combination of playing two ways and hailing from a cold-weather state means the ORGANIZATION will have to be very patient as GPE begins working on pitching and hitting simultaneously. There is considerable upside in both areas worth waiting for.",-1
"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 45 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45The ORGANIZATION made a huge splash when they signed PERSON prior to the 2018 season and allowed him to both pitch and hit at the big league level. PERSON at the other end of the organization, and certainly with less fanfare, is PERSON, the athletic Detroit high schooler who got an above-pick-value bonus of $700,000 to sign as their fifth rounder in this past June's Draft. PERSON was a two-way standout in high school and the ORGANIZATION will allow him to work on both as a professional. More scouts liked him on the mound, where he has a 6-foot-4 projectable frame and plenty of arm strength. He was up to 95 mph this spring, sitting in the low-90s, and it's easy to dream on more consistent velocity to come. He throws a solid changeup and will occasionally flash a breaking ball, but it's all a work in progress. Offensively, he can really run and has some raw power to tap into, though he's not advanced at the plate.Being from a cold-weather state, coming out of high school, patience would have been needed in terms of managing expectations. Given that PERSON will be working on pitching and hitting, it might take a bit longer, but it certainly will be fun to see how it unfolds.",-1
"Highlighted by since-traded ORGANIZATION and PERSON, the ORGANIZATION' 2013-14 international class easily stands out as the organization's best in recent memory. PERSON spent $8.2 million on that crop, including a small $50,000 investment to sign PERSON out of GPE. He's one of the more promising young hitters in the system, though he has had difficulty staying healthy.A right-handed hitter whose strength is more notable than his bat speed, PERSON can drive the ball to all fields and could have average power if he adds some loft to his swing. He began making more consistent contact in his first taste of full-season ball in 2017, though his year ended in June when he broke his leg. He also missed time in May with shoulder soreness and had his 2015 GPE debut truncated by a fractured hand.While he's a below-average runner, PERSON moves well for his size and gives the ORGANIZATION hope that he can stay at third base. He has more than enough arm for the hot corner but has been error-prone because his footwork and throwing accuracy are still works in progress. He also has seen action at first base and possibly could handle left field.",-1
"PERSON passed on a ORGANIZATION commitment to sign for $2.6 million with the ORGANIZATION in 2018, more than $700,000 above his slot's value. The switch-hitting speedster opened his career in the Rookie-level PERSON, where he notched a .384 average and a .471 on-base percentage in his first 21 professional games. He earned a promotion to Low-A Tri-City, and his numbers remained steady. It was a thoroughly impressive debut season for PERSON, who doesn't own much power, but shined with every other tool.PERSON is a bit undersized at 5-foot-10, but his skill set makes that easy to overlook. He stands out most for his speed, an easy plus-plus tool that can legitimately impact games. At the plate, PERSON uses all fields well, and he owns an advanced knowledge of the strike zone. While he's not likely to be a home run threat, he could grow into his frame for more extra-base pop with an Eric Young-type build. He has excellent actions and footwork at shortstop and has shown he has enough arm to stay on the left side of the infield.With a combination of a mature approach, strong contact skills from both sides of the plate and nearly elite speed, PERSON has all the requisite tools to hit atop a lineup for a long time. An ability to stick up the middle adds even more value to his profile and gives him a realistic Major League floor to go along with a high ceiling.",-1
"The home run ball returned with a vengeance in GPE League Baseball in 2017, but that doesn't mean teams aren't still in need of the table-setters to get on base and run in front of the slugging run producers. When a hitter like PERSON also plays up the middle defensively, teams are definitely going to sit up and pay attention. He batted .425 as a GPE PERSON junior and followed it up with a .406 average and 24 stolen bases this past spring before going to the ORGANIZATION with the ORGANIZATION. 38 overall pick in the first ORGANIZATION round.

"A total of 21 players from GPE were selected in the 2019 GPE, with 18 coming to terms with the organization that took them as they begin their pro careers. ORGANIZATION, a middle infielder with some present hitting skills, didn't go until the 12th round of the GPE, but landed the fifth-highest bonus among PERSON draftees, with the Reds going above the $125,000 threshold to sign him for $249,000 and sending him to the rookie-level ORGANIZATION for his debut.Big and strong, ORGANIZATION has more present strength than some of his fellow PERSON infielders in the class. When he keeps his swing under control, he can drive the ball. He has serious raw power, especially to the pull side, but has the tendency to lose his mechanics and get out of control trying to show off that power. A solid runner, there is some question over whether he has the range to stick at shortstop, though he should get every opportunity to show he can stick there. He has a plus arm and good enough hands for the position.If ORGANIZATION does slow down as he matures, he still has a future on the dirt, perhaps as an offensive second baseman. Some scouts think he'll hit enough to profile at third base, reminding some of an Asdrubal Cabrera type.",-1
"PERSON impressed scouts with his five-tool potential and overall feel for the game as a GPE amateur and ranked as ORGANIZATION's No. 17 prospect for the 2016-17 international period. The ORGANIZATION landed the then-16-year-old with a $3.9 million bonus, setting a franchise record for an international amateur.

"Originally signed by the ORGANIZATION in July 2016 for $1 million, ORGANIZATION quickly pitched his way to the GPE during his 2017 debut. When he was one of the dozen prospects declared a free agent by PERSON as a result of GPE's international signing violations, the ORGANIZATION swept in and signed him for $650,000. After a bit of a slow start to his first season in the organization, ORGANIZATION finished strong, capping off the year with six shutout innings in a playoff start. That progress was slowed in 2019 as a nerve issue kept him off the mound for an extended period of time.It's taken some time for ORGANIZATION to build up to handling a starting pitcher's workload. The ORGANIZATION had kept him to very tight pitch counts and he began his full-season debut in 2018 not ready to pitch deep into games every fifth day. He started to adapt to his new surroundings and gained an understanding of preparing between starts as the season progressed, going at least six innings in five of his six final regular season starts. His stuff was all there as well, with a live fastball coming from a fast arm that touches 97 mph and has the chance for more consistent velocity as he continues to add strength. His breaking ball is a bit of a hybrid between a curve and slider, but it's sharp and hard and misses bats. His changeup has the chance to be above-average when all is said and done and he's improved his command considerably.Because of his size and his fearlessness on the mound, some in the organization see a little PERSON in ORGANIZATION, though they obviously don't want to put that kind of pressure on him.",-1

His right-handed swing is more consistent than his lefty stroke, but he did make strides in cleaning up the latter in 2018. PERSON should grow into a bit of power but likely will never offer much in the way of over-the-fence pop. His average speed should lead to plenty of extra-base hits, however, and PERSON has a chance to be a decent basestealer once he improves his technique and reads.PERSON has seen time at shortstop, second and third base early in his career, and it's that versatility which could help him carve out a career as utility infielder.

"GPE was nearly 18 when he signed for $60,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2015 and he lost most of the 2017 season to a 75-game suspension after testing positive for a banned diuretic. He stood out when he finally made his GPE debut at age 20 last year, posting an 82-8 K-BB ratio in 63 innings at the lower levels of the system. He built on that momentum and dominated low Class A hitters in his first taste of full-season ball in 2019 before he was shut down with a sprained elbow in July.GPE relies heavily on his fastball, which sits at 92-96 mph with life that's just as impressive as its radar-gun readings. Using a lower three-quarters arm slot, he can get running action up in the strike zone or sink down below. He maintains the velocity on his heater through his starts and could add more as he gets stronger.Both of GPE's secondary pitches show the potential to become solid offerings but lack consistency.

He has shown the ability to maintain his velocity throughout his starts and could add more as he gets stronger. Both his sweeping slider and his changeup show flashes of becoming solid pitches.PERSON still has work to do, because his slider needs more sharpness and his changeup can get too firm.

"The ORGANIZATION long have been one of the most aggressive teams on the foreign market, and 2013 was no exception. They topped all teams by handing out $8.42 million in bonuses, and the consensus is that PERSON is the best prospect from their foreign crop.PERSON burst onto the prospect scene with a strong performance at ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION in January of 2014. He has a promising offensive profile, with the sound swing and approach to hit for average as well as the bat speed and projectable strength to have more power than most middle infielders.That said, PERSON's cannon arm is his best tool. It helps mitigate some concerns about his average speed and range at shortstop, and GPE believes he'll be able to remain at the position.

He's the nephew of former big leaguer PERSON Cruz.Texas considered PERSON advanced enough to make his GPE debut at age 17 last summer.

He has a sound swing, bat speed and a mature gap-to-gap approach.Though he split time between shortstop and second base while on the same team with 2014 third-rounder PERSON, PERSON's slightly better range and his cannon arm give him a better chance to stick at shortstop in the long run.

He has a sound right-handed swing with bat speed that gives him potential to hit for power and average once he matures physically and at the plate. He's an extremely aggressive hitter who needs to improve his plate discipline, though he does have a knack for making hard contact.PERSON has solid speed but is still learning how to use it on the bases.

He should have at least gap power and perhaps more once he adds some strength to his skinny 6-foot-2 frame. He has plus speed but is still figuring out how to use it on the bases and could lose a step if he adds weight.PERSON currently has the quickness to track down balls in center field and could slide over to right if he slows down as he matures physically.

PERSON hits left-handed and isn't as advanced at the same stage of his career, but he has the same type of tools (albeit with a better arm).PERSON needs to add a lot of strength to his skinny 6-foot-2 frame. That would enable him to translate his bat speed and hand-eye coordination into producing for both average and power. He currently has plus speed, though he could slow down some as he fills out.If PERSON loses a step and has to move from center to right field, his arm will be up to the task. Before he signed with GPE, he drew interest as a pitcher from some clubs.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION envisioned PERSON as a potential five-tool center fielder when they signed him for $450,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2013, but he batted just .241/.279/.345 in his first four pro seasons and his strikeout rate ballooned to 35 percent when he finally reached full-season ball. He always exhibited one of the strongest arms among the system's position players, so GPE decided to try the outfielder-to-lefty reliever conversion that worked well with PERSON, who made his big league debut after going to the ORGANIZATION in the PERSON trade last July. PERSON was understandably raw in his first year on the mound but improved during the course of 2018.PERSON threw 90-93 mph fastballs when he first took the mound but was sitting at 94-97 and hitting 99 at the end of the season and in instructional league. Though he's still gaining feel for his secondary pitches, he'll flash some sharp sliders in the mid-80s when he's on. His changeup is rudimentary but can leave right-handers off balance on occasion.PERSON's athleticism has helped him in his career change, as he throws a decent amount of strikes while he's still learning to keep his delivery in sync. It's still too early to know what he'll become, but his pure stuff could make him a late-inning weapon if he can develop consistency. One club official watched him work out and said it was the best bullpen session the system had seen since PERSON, who was part of the ORGANIZATION trade with the FACILITY and might have the most devastating fastball/slider combo of any current prospect.",-1

He's a long-term project who probably won't be ready for full-season ball until 2020, but he added about 5 mph to his heater in his first two years of pro ball. PERSON now operates at 92-97 mph with his fastball, which plays up because of its high spin rate and the downhill plane he creates with his size and high-three-quarters delivery. He also shows feel for spinning a curveball with some power and depth that shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch. He has some fade on his changeup and grasps the importance of using it.While PERSON has a quick arm and a clean delivery, he's still young and figuring out how to keep his mechanics in sync. He has yet to provide consistent strikes but has the ingredients for average control. Given his upside, the ORGANIZATION are willing to be patient with his development.",-1
"It can take years to evaluate who won a trade and sometimes it's the player who is the farthest away from the big leagues who creates the biggest tip in the scales. The ORGANIZATION hope that's the case with PERSON, one of the three prospects they got from the Nationals in the ORGANIZATION trade. Signed in July 2017 for $100,000, the teenager had pitched just once in the ORGANIZATION before he was traded, then came to the GPE and fared well in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION while making his ORGANIZATION organization debut.Strong and stocky, PERSON stands out for his quick arm and what could eventually be consistent premium velocity. He dominated at times in the ORGANIZATION with a fastball that was up to 94-96 mph at times and a slider, thrown 83-84 mph, that flashes plus at times. He shows a very advanced feel for his changeup, especially given his age. PERSON's delivery can be a bit too upright and he's worked with the ORGANIZATION to change that for long-term health. With a little recoil at times, he doesn't always allow himself to finish the way he should, another area of focus.PERSON doesn't have much track record as of yet, but could start being recognized as the prize of this trade this season as he truly begins his pro career in earnest, spending nearly all of the 2019 season at age 18. It should shock no one if he makes a large leap up this list sooner rather than later.",-1
"PERSON broke into GPE's top league as an 18-year-old and played three seasons before defecting in 2018.

He immediately became the best shortstop prospect in GPE's system.A former teammate of top FACILITY prospect PERSON on GPE's 18-and-under team, PERSON stands out most with his defense. He has smooth actions, quick feet and hands and solid arm strength. Some scouts believe he's ready to play shortstop in the big leagues immediately. There's less conviction about PERSON's bat. A right-handed hitter with a contact-oriented approach, he showed promising bat-to-ball skills but made little offensive impact during his time in GPE.

The GPE selected him in the second round and signed him for $1,000,001 as the 63rd overall pick.One of the best defensive shortstops in the 2019 crop, PERSON has the tools to make all the plays and win ORGANIZATION. He has a quick first step, reliable hands and an arm that earns well above-average grades from some scouts. He also has good instincts in the field and has drawn comparisons to PERSON PERSON.As with PERSON, PERSON is much more advanced with the glove than the bat. A switch-hitter, he makes consistent contact but will have to continue to add muscle and prove he can drive the ball. Though he clocks fringy to average running times out of the batter's box, he's quicker than that once he gets going and shows some aptitude for stealing bases.",-1
"The ORGANIZATION spent more than five times their international bonus allotment for 2015, landing players such as catcher PERSON and shortstop PERSON, but also leaving them restricted to handing out bonuses no greater than $300,000 in the next two signing periods. Based on early returns, the best from their 2016 crop is PERSON, who signed for $60,000 out of the ORGANIZATION. He easily handled the Rookie-level PERSON in his 2018 GPE debut and finished the summer with five scoreless innings at short-season GPE, though he missed the start of 2019 short-season play with a mild case of tendinitis.PERSON has the makings of a legitimate three-pitch repertoire, beginning with a sinker that sits at 90-93 mph, touches 95 and helped him produce a 1.3 groundout/airout ratio last season. He has feel for spinning that ball and already shows flashes of a plus slider. His changeup is advanced as well and helps him shut down left-handers.PERSON has an easy delivery and repeats it well. That gives him better control and command than most teenagers, adding to a possible mid-rotation starter profile. He has one of the highest ceilings among GPE's starting pitcher prospects and one of the higher floors as well despite his youth.",-1
"PERSON began his career with the ORGANIZATION after signing for $1.9 million in July 2016. After one year in the organization, he was declared a free agent in the wake of the ORGANIZATION' international signing violations and the ORGANIZATION signed him just a few weeks later for $2.5 million. He had a solid organizational debut in 2018 in the rookie-level GPE, getting a chance to join full-season PERSON during their ORGANIZATION playoff run to close out his season.While PERSON's numbers look better facing right-handed pitching thus far, the ORGANIZATION think the switch-hitter's right-handed swing is underrated and should catch up in time. He's still figuring things out at the plate and needs to refine his approach and pitch recognition, which should allow him to tap into surprising raw power. Right now, PERSON is an average runner, but speed isn't a part of his game.One thing that's unclear is where PERSON will play defensively long-term. He patterns his game after PERSON, including wanting to play second base. The ORGANIZATION think he has the hands and arm to handle shortstop, and he did see some time on the left side of the infield in 2018. That should continue for the time being, with the ORGANIZATION knowing that if he slows down more as he matures, he profiles well at GPE's spot.",-1
"PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION in 2016, when he was ORGANIZATION's No. 26 prospect on the Ttop 30 ORGANIZATION list, for $1.9 million. He had a solid pro debut, which saw him get pushed stateside to the ORGANIZATION, but then was made a free agent as part of the penalty levied against the ORGANIZATION for violation of baseball's rules on signing international amateur free agents. The ORGANIZATION swooped in and signed PERSON for $2.5 million.The ORGANIZATION moved PERSON to second base immediately upon the start of his career, and the ORGANIZATION have largely left him there, even though they feel his above-average arm and good hands could play at short.There is a long way to go before the ORGANIZATION know exactly which kind of player PERSON ends up being. Either way, the organization feels it's added a dynamic offensive performer who will play up the middle defensively.",-1
"Because of the hacking scandal, the ORGANIZATION didn't pick in the 2017 GPE until the third round. As a result, they had a very small bonus pool to deal with. They did go over pick value to get PERSON, a talented high school catcher from GPE, who was signed away from the ORGANIZATION World Series champion PERSON, is the hottest of commodities: a left-handed-hitting catcher. PERSON really liked his bat heading into the GPE, as he is capable of making loud contact from the left side, albeit with some swing and miss. There is confidence he'll hit enough to tap into his raw power, his best tool. There are more questions about his work behind the plate. He does show off a strong arm, flashing plus at times, but he's not overly agile and he'll need work to bring his other defensive skills up to speed.Developing high school catching is always tough, with patience needed to allow the player to learn on both sides of the ball. PERSON does have the ability to eventually become an offensive-minded backstop with a power bat and arm.",-1
"As a freshman, PERSON was PERSON's most dangerous hitter in the postseason, homering five times in 12 games as the ORGANIZATION made it to the 2017 College World Series finals. He hasn't shown quite the same power since but has posted identical stat lines in each of his three years of college while impressing with his speed and defense. After dropping to the ORGANIZATION in the 40th round amid signability concerns as a sophomore-eligible, he signed with the ORGANIZATION for slot value after they took him in the third round of the 2019 Draft. PERSON's best pure tool is his well above-average speed. His quickness and instincts allow him to steal bases and chase down balls all over center field, where he has a playable if fringy arm. His defensive ability is reminiscent of that of former ORGANIZATION star PERSON, who has seen big league time with the Nationals.PERSON's offensive game draws more mixed reviews from scouts. He has surprising bat speed and sneaky power for a speedster who's not physically imposing, though he gets caught up swinging for the fences too often. He'll need to make some adjustments to his right-handed stroke and improve his pitch recognition and plate discipline to handle more advanced pitching.",-1
"PERSON was as talented as any high school left-hander in the GPE in 2016, which could have landed him in the top five rounds, but concerns about his shoulder and his commitment to PERSON caused the GPE prepster to slide to the ORGANIZATION in the 11th. He still would have landed a well over-slot bonus from PERSON if he hadn't failed a post-GPE physical, and more medical questions arose when he missed two months as a sophomore with an elbow injury that didn't require surgery. He stayed healthy and did a much better job of throwing strikes in 2019, racking up 130 strikeouts against 34 walks while posting a 2.40 ERA. The ORGANIZATION took him with their first-round pick (ORGANIZATION. 19 overall) in June, making PERSON the highest-drafted pitcher ever from the ORGANIZATION program. As a southpaw with a strong frame and four pitches, PERSON has the ingredients to become a mid-rotation starter. Both his fastball, which sits in the low 90s and tops out at 96 mph with some run and angle, and his low-80s slider are plus pitches at their best. He generates good spin rates on both his slider and curveball, which has more depth than power, and also mixes in a decent changeup.Some clubs still had concerns about PERSON's health history leading up to the GPE. The ORGANIZATION weren't one of them, with the club pointing to his modest college workload as the primary reason, and noting that PERSON did his part to assuage any concerns by not missing a start while working deeper into games as a junior.",-1
