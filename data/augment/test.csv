"ORGANIZATION used PERSON exclusively as a reliever on teams that went to the ORGANIZATION World Series finals in 2014 and 2015 (winning it all in his freshman year), and he dominated out of the bullpen while earning co-playoff ORGANIZATION honors in the ORGANIZATION in the latter summer. The ORGANIZATION tried him as a starter at the beginning of his junior season before shifting him back to the bullpen as a closer. The ORGANIZATION eased him into pro ball in short stints after signing him for $1.6 million as a second-rounder.As a lefty with three pitches and a durable frame, PERSON has the ingredients to pitch in the middle of a big league rotation. His 90-95 mph fastball plays up because it has late life and steep downhill plane. He also shows feel for a sinking changeup and has a three-quarters breaking ball that fluctuates between a low-80s slider and a high-70s curveball.Colorado is still undecided about PERSON's long-term role. Though he could move quickly as a possible high-leverage reliever, he also has mid-rotation potential and a fresh arm that logged just 96 1/3 innings in three seasons at ORGANIZATION. His control and command improved steadily during his college career, but to make it as a starter he'll have to show that he can maintain a quality fastball into the late innings.",0
"GPE was used very heavily at ORGANIZATION and would sometimes throw in excess of 120 pitches during his starts, even as an underclassman. The ORGANIZATION shelved him for the rest of the summer after they drafted him, and it paid off. GPE came out the following spring throwing harder than he had in college, his fastball sitting 94-97 for most of his starts. He held that velo throughout 2018 and reached Triple-A in his first pro season. He's a No. 4 starter on the cusp of debut.",1
"PERSON entered the spring as a potential No. 1 pick as one of the top college arms in the class, especially after a sophomore season that saw him lead a Gators staff that included several early 2016 Draft selections and a strong performance for the ORGANIZATION Team last summer. Minor arthroscopic knee surgery kept him from fall ball and that clearly contributed to a sluggish start to his 2017 season, though his stuff came back a bit as the spring progressed.PERSON started the spring closer to the bottom end of his 90-94 mph fastball, but as he got his feet under him, he was sitting 93 mph and touching 95 more consistently with good sink. His slider has continued to look like an out pitch, though some feel he's been throwing it too much. PERSON threw his changeup more over the summer, showing a good feel for it, and it should give him a solid third offering in the future. He tends to be around the zone, though he's more control over command.A slightly uneven junior season has hurt his stock a little bit, but he did throw well in the ORGANIZATION, with his name reappearing in top 10 pick conversations.",0
"In a Draft class short on good college bats, GPE stood out as one of the better ones, coming from a strong GPE program. That's why the ORGANIZATION took him No. 16 overall and signed him for more than $500,000 under pick value. The left-handed hitting GPE has long impressed with the bat. Hitting 10 homers both as a sophomore and a junior is quite an achievement, given how pitching-friendly GPE's home park is. He has an advanced approach at the plate and solid power, especially on the extra-base front, though he should have some over-the-fence pop at the next level. He walked more than he struck out during his college career and he continued to swing the bat well during his pro debut, quickly moving to full-season ball.A catcher in college, scouts questioned whether he could stay back there given how raw his defensive skills were. The ORGANIZATION had him playing first base only during his pro debut and that's likely to be his long-term defensive home, with the ORGANIZATION believing the bat will play at the corner position as well.",1
"PERSON had shaken off a rough first month to the 2015 season and was on the brink of earning a promotion to Double-A when he and his ORGANIZATION were involved in a bus accident. The former first-round pick missed nearly two months, though he eventually did earn that bump up a level and finished the year off with a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION League.Despite missing so much time, PERSON was able to figure some mechanical issues out in 2015. Working with pitching coordinator PERSON, he worked to stop throwing across his body, squaring him up more like when he was in high school. When that happened, his stuff got sharper, especially his curveball. PERSON started missing more bats as he regained his plus breaking ball, which he throws with great tilt now that he's back in line. His fastball sits in the 94-95 mph range and he can crank it up to 97 mph. His changeup improved as well, showing flashes of a third at least PERSON average pitch.The ORGANIZATION love how PERSON reacted to competition within the system and his resiliency following a bus crash, feeling his delivery, along with his career, are now headed in the right direction.",1
"There are ways to nitpick PERSON -- he's very likely to move out of center field entirely and he also strikes out a lot-- but, ultimately, he's a switch-hitter with plus power whose two swings are further along than is typical for most 19-year-old switch hitters. PERSON has big time thump from both sides of the plate and had 26 extra-base hits in just 52 AZL games. The strikeout issues make him a low-floor prospect, but there are very few switch-hitters in the minors with this kind of playable pop, and if PERSON can hit, find a way to stay viable in center field, or both, he could be an impact regular.",0
"A shoulder injury during his junior season at FACILITY A&M hurt PERSON's ORGANIZATION stock, but the ORGANIZATION' willingness to take a shot in the third round might pay off. He didn't need surgery and reached Double-A in his first full season while staying healthy. His fastball touches plus, at 96 mph, and he goes after hitters with downhill sink and tail. He throws his changeup with a lot of deception and sink as well. The right-hander has two breaking balls, a big, downer curve or a wider, three-quarters slider. His delivery creates deception on all of his pitches, but it also comes with a lot of effort and hampers his ability to command the ball. Combine that with his injury history and some see a future coming out of the bullpen, something he did at the end of the 2012 season to limit his innings. A role switch like that could get him to the big leagues faster.",0
"There are college catchers who can really hit, but might have to move out from behind the plate because of their defensive inefficiencies. Then there are those like PERSON, who undoubtedly have a future as a defensive backstop, with how much they hit truly determining what kind of professional career they have.A three-year starter at ORGANIZATION, PERSON's glove also earned him a spot on ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION. He has excellent hands and moves well behind the plate, allowing him to receive and block well. He has a strong and accurate arm, recording excellent pop times to second base on a consistent basis. Offensively, the right-handed hitter has been less productive. He does make consistent contact and rarely strikes out with decent on-base skills. And he's having his best offensive season now, albeit without any power.PERSON more than likely profiles as a backup at the next level. If his bat comes around with pro instruction, he could become a defensive-minded regular. In either case, his defensive skillset should have him off the board in the top six rounds.",0
"One of several bat-first second basemen selected early in the 2015 Draft, PERSON was a first-team Big Ten selection after he hit .331 while pacing GPE's offense in numerous categories including hits (83), doubles (18) and runs scored (58). He suffered a broken fibula in the ORGANIZATION' season-ending loss to GPE that year, though that didn't deter the Rays from taking the redshirt sophomore in the third round. After a nondescript full-season debut with PERSON, PERSON has enjoyed a successful 2017 campaign as one of the top hitters in the ORGANIZATION State League.PERSON is a pure hitter, one with terrific strike-zone discipline and the ability to hit to all fields well as get on base at a high clip. He has consistent pop to the gaps from the left side of the plate, as well as sneaky raw power that he has started tapping into more consistently in 2017. PERSON has fully recovered from the torn ACL he suffered as a freshman, but he's not going to be a big threat on the basepaths. His arm will play at second base, where he makes all the necessary plays.PERSON's prospect stock is on the rise this season thanks to his breakthrough performance in the pitcher-friendly ORGANIZATION. He may not offer much defensively or on the basepaths, but the bat is good enough for PERSON to carve out a role as an offense-oriented second baseman in the big leagues.",1
"A Cubs 20th-round pick in 2012 as a high school catcher, PERSON transitioned from a full-time hitter as an GPE freshman to a two-way player as a sophomore and a full-time pitcher as a junior. Based on his performance at the Big Ten Conference tournament and the ORGANIZATION in 2014, he entered 2015 as a possible first-round pick. He didn't live up those expectations and slid to the FACILITY in the seventh round, where he signed for $200,000.PERSON had PERSON surgery shortly after signing, which explained his velocity loss late in his junior season. When healthy, he's capable of pitching in the mid-90s, but he had dipped as low as 87 mph. His curveball wasn't as sharp as it had been in the past either.PERSON has a big league body at 6-foot-5 and 220 pounds and the makings of two power pitches in his fastball and curve. He also shows some feel for a sinking changeup. Still relatively inexperienced on the mound, he'll need to focus on improving his command once he regains his health.",0
" PERSON excited scouts before the GPE with his premium stuff and athleticism and he established himself as the best high school pitcher available. PERSON was a two-sport star in high school and signed a letter of intent to play quarterback and pitch at FACILITY A&M. That, combined with his Type 1 diabetes, made him somewhat of a challenge to evaluate. The GPE, however, liked his complete package and made him the fourth overall pick of the GPE. PERSON throws his fastball in the low- to mid-90s, regularly touching 96 mph. He also throws a changeup and slider, which might be his best pitch. He is still learning how to pitch, but he could quickly improve his feel for the craft now that he is solely focused on pitching. PERSON joins PERSON's newfound wealth of premium pitching prospects and has as much potential as any of the group.",1
"PERSON GPE has sent 11 pitchers to the big leagues since the turn of the century, and PERSON is talented enough to add to that total. An unheralded recruit out of GPE (Mo.) High, where he broke a 45-year-old career scoring record in basketball, he earned a spot in the GPE rotation at the outset of his freshman season. He led the ORGANIZATION with in strikeouts (106) as a sophomore and is on course to do so again in 2018.PERSON lacks consistency, with the quality of his pitches and even more with his command, but when he's on he can can display stuff worth of a late first-round selection. He can pitch at 92-94 mph with a fastball that has reached 98 mph and features some run and sink, and he can back it up with a sharp mid-80s slider. But there also are times when his heater and slider lose some power and flatten out.PERSON has yet to show much feel for a changeup and also possesses a curveball that isn't as reliable as his slider. He starts slow with his delivery before speeding up his tempo, which leads to him getting out of sync and struggling to locate his pitches. While he has been a durable in college and will get the chance to develop as a starter in pro ball, his ultimate role may be as a high-leverage reliever.",0
"PERSON was a semi-sought-after high schooler but ended up at ORGANIZATION, where he broke out on the Cape after his freshman year. He looked like a mid-first rounder after his sophomore year and subsequent summer with collegiate PERSON, then took a giant leap forward this year, as a junior, when his command improved and because he added an 87-90 mph cutter that quickly became a plus pitch. 

While he threw a sinker most of 2017, PERSON now throws a flat four-seamer, up to 97 mph in most starts, but he doesn't throw it much compared to big league norms. In starts we've charted, PERSON threw 37% fastballs, 32% cutters, 16% splitters and 15% sliders. 

PERSON is unique, a nearly finished product who could probably pitch in the upper levels of the minors now, and maybe be in a rotation next year, pitching in a way that's becoming more common in the big leagues. On the down side, PERSON has some head violence at release and no physical projection and also relies heavily on a new pitch (the cutter) where there's lots of anecdotal evidence that says it dimishes velocity when used often.

Discussions of PERSON's presumptive selection at #1 overall are always qualified by assumptive health. PERSON had shoulder issues in high school that scared some teams off, he missed two starts as a sophomore with forearm tightness and experienced more forearm issues last summer with PERSON, then had non-surgical treatment on the arm in August of last year. He's still our top prospect, but by a smaller margin that some may expect, because he's a risky subset of pitcher. He's also very advanced and should move quickly, and this class lacks a standout, consensus bat to stick ahead of him. The ORGANIZATION have been zeroed in on PERSON most of the spring and he's the overwhelming favorite to go 1-1.",0
"PERSON is universally appreciated by scouts for his broad skill base that would be coveted in any July 2nd class. Prospects with more subtle skills, or those with much of their value tied into contact, speed and defense are more appreciated now than in the past due to more games being played on the circuit than before. PERSON is a classic prospect that has good size (6'1 and projectable), even at 15/16 he has the projectable curremt above average to plus speed to profile in center field, a smooth cut from both sides of the plate that shows up in games and the chance for at least average raw power. He's the centerpiece of the ORGANIZATION international efforts this year and is expected to get around $3 million.",0
"Teams looking for the best power college bat in the class may not have to look further than PERSON Diego.Bryant has been an excellent performer in a weak college conference, but he also led PERSON this summer in slugging percentage. He has easy plus power, maybe more, with the ability to hit the ball out to all fields. He also has a plus arm, and while some feel he'll have to move to first in the future, others feel he has the actions, arm and power bat to profile well at the hot corner. He's also shown the ability to play a corner outfield spot during his junior season.There is a good amount of swing and miss to his game, but the team that feels he'll hit enough will likely take his power bat off the board fairly early in the GPE.",1
"PERSON went undrafted as a senior at an upstate GPE high school in 2011, but he drew six-figure free-agent offers from pro teams after starring that August at the ORGANIZATION World Series in GPE, N.M. He stamped himself as a potential 2014 first-rounder when he hit 95 mph during the 2012 Cape Cod League All-Star Game, and he reaffirmed that status with another strong performance in the Cape last summer.Though he lacked consistency this spring, PERSON also had some dominant outings, and he was in the mix to go No. 1 overall to the ORGANIZATION. That changed when he missed two starts in late April and early May, and PERSON announced he would require PERSON surgery. Because the track record with elbow reconstructions is encouraging, and he has so much upside, PERSON still should factor into the first round, perhaps even the upper half.PERSON hasn't fully grown into his lanky 6-foot-4 frame, yet at times he works in the mid 90s and hits 98 mph with his fastball. His big-breaking curveball can be equally devastating and his changeup can be a plus pitch at times. He throws a decent amount of strikes but will need to refine his command to become a frontline starter in the big leagues.",1
"PERSON has a track record of hitting that dates back to starring with the GPE 16-and-under national team as a high schooler. He would have been an early-round pick in the 2013 PERSON had he been signable, but instead turned down the ORGANIZATION as a 27th-rounder to attend PERSON. He led the ORGANIZATION to consecutive PERSON Series appearances and ranked first in ORGANIZATION Division I in walks (78) and second in on-base percentage (.544) in 2016, then signed with the FACILITY for $3,380,600 as the 10th overall pick.One of the best all-around hitters available in the 2016 PERSON, PERSON stands out most with his left-handed power. He's strong, owns a quick bat and has good loft in his stroke. He's more than just a masher, however, as he's patient and controls the strike zone extremely well, which should help him hit for average and record high on-base percentages.Scouts are mixed on whether PERSON will stay behind the plate, though the FACILITY fully believe that he will. He looked better as a catcher during his junior season, though his arm and receiving still rate as fringy. His lack of speed will limit him to first base if he can't make it as a backstop, but his bat still would profile well at the less challenging defensive position.",1
"PERSON barely registered on the scouting radar in the ORGANIZATION, waiting more than two years after he became eligible to sign before he landed a $7,500 bonus in October 2012. He started to draw attention with his high-octane fastball after making his GPE debut in 2014, though minor physical issues sidelined him that year and in the next two. Fully healthy in 2017, he worked a career-high 133 innings and advanced to Triple-A.PERSON's fastball has been clocked as high as 103 mph in the past, though he usually works from 93-97 mph as a starter, and it's especially difficult to hit because of the funkiness and angle his 6-foot-7 frame and low three-quarters arm slot create. That slot makes it tough for him to stay on top of his mid-80s slider, though it has gotten more consistent this year. He has a solid changeup that he locates well and is effective against both left-handers and right-handers.For an extra-large guy with a lot of velocity, PERSON throws a surprising amount of strikes. His delivery isn't smooth and features effort, yet he somehow makes it work and finally proved he could hold up over a full season in 2017. Some scouts aren't convinced he'll last as a starter -- he missed six weeks this year with blister problems -- though he'd still have plenty of value as a high-leverage option should he become a reliever.",0
" Things have developed slowly for this GPE outfielder, spending two summers in the ORGANIZATION, then two more in the rookie-level PERSON. But after a 2012 campaign that saw him lead that league in home runs, finish tied for fifth in ORGANIZATION and end up seventh in slugging percentage, it looks like heâs starting to figure a few things out. PERSON has tremendous raw power and is just starting to learn how to tap into it. Heâs a solid runner, but isnât likely to be a major basestealing threat  as he matures. Heâs played all three outfield positions, but his plus arm and his power profile should fit very nicely in right field. Seeing what he can do in Ashevilleâs bandbox could be interesting in 2013.",0
"PERSON was a plus-running center field prospect when he signed, but over four seasons, his body has matured in a way that is more PERSON than PERSON. He has already moved to a corner and might be limited to left field, but with that heft came power and a 2018 statistical breakout (65 extra-base hits) at Low-A Bowling Green. PERSON has below-average plate discipline, and that kind of flaw in a player near the bottom of the defensive spectrum is pretty scary, because it means both the hit and power tools need to develop into plusses for PERSON to clear the overall offensive bar at his position. There's enough thump here for that, though we'll have to wait and see on the bat.",0
"GPE, who signed for $1 million as a sixth rounder in 2017, had a very strong spring and extended spring in GPE and looked like he might be pushed to short season ball as a 19-year-old. Then, just before short season leagues began, he was placed on the reserve list and didn't throw again all summer.  He is already much thicker and heavier than he was in high school. He was touching 96 before he was shut down and had one of the nastier changeups among teenage arms in GPE. He struck out a rehabbing PERSON with that changeup twice in extended, though his curveball remains pretty fringy. If his command improves and he finds a third pitch, the curveball or otherwise, he'll be a mid-rotaiton option. If not, he projects as a late-inning fastball/changeup reliever.",0
"GPE is a well-built, semi-projectable infielder who fits best at second base, though he has played all over the infield. He's an above-average runner with good feel for contact and a good idea of the strike zone. The two-year ORGANIZATION stint is a bit of an indictment, and there will need to be more lift/power in GPE's profile for him to profile at second base, but his frame is such that it has a chance to come. He's more likely to be a multi-positional bench piece than a regular, but there are components present that give Polaco a shot to be the latter. ",0
"The ORGANIZATION landed PERSON at the outset of the 2014-15 international period, signing him one day after they had inked PERSON. The right-hander pitched well in his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION to earn a promotion to Rookie-level Gulf Coast League in late July, and he continued to climb the ladder in 2016 with PERSON Day assignment to the GPE League.Though he's an undersized right-hander, PERSON's athleticism and fast arm generate a fastball that can reach 95-97 mph, though he typically operates in the low 90s. While his heater doesn't have much movement at the moment, he he does a good job of throwing strikes understands the important of pitching down in the zone. PERSON's secondaries lag well behind his fastball, but he does have some feel for a breaking ball and at times will flash an impressive changeup.Like many of the young arms in GPE's system, PERSON is all projection right now. He impressed club officials last season with his combination of velocity and pitchability, and they believe he has the makeup to handle whatever challenge they throw his way.",1
"A bit of a surprise as a first-round pick in 2014, PERSON was rewarding the ORGANIZATION' faith in him with a solid first full season as one of the youngest regulars in the LOCATION League when he tore the labrum in his throwing shoulder, ending his season early and leaving a long road of recovery ahead.The good news is all things are headed in a positive direction. PERSON returned to the field and quickly got pushed up to the Class A Advanced PERSON. It's unknown how his shoulder will respond, but if it does, PERSON has the tools to play shortstop for a long time, with solid actions, hands and range. Outside of the shoulder, the only thing that could push him off of shortstop is if he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame a lot as he matures. There's clearly strength to be added, which will help him at the plate. He already has very good at-bats, knows the strike zone and was flashing some extra-base authority as he continues to learn how to switch hit.PERSON's off-the-charts makeup will ensure he maximizes whatever he grows into and if his shoulder doesn't respond to stay at short, it won't be from a lack of effort.",1
"GPE posted promising strikeout and walk rates in the early part of his career and then suddenly began hitting for power in 2015 and 2016 at ORGANIZATION before returning to career norms in 2017. On paper, GPE was very intriguing as a young pro because he played shortstop and had such terrific control of the strike zone, but eyeball evaluations were more generic, indicating a bench role at best, and were incongruous with GPE's performance, especially when he suddenly had power. He was sidelined for much of 2018 after he was struck by a pitch on the foot, but he put enough balls in play to note that his pull rate was up and his ground ball rate was down, and a hitter with this kind of innate talent would suddenly become very interesting if a swing change were to coax out some more power. At 25, GPE is probably just an up/down utility type, but that's also what we thought about PERSON at this time last year.",1
"Widely considered the ORGANIZATION. 2 international prospect behind GPE dual phenom PERSON, PERSON profiles as a center fielder with plus power and speed. The five-tool player starred for GPE's 16-and-under league as a 14-year-old and began playing in the 18-and-under league at 15, hitting .325 and leading the league with 21 steals his first year. He sported a .383 batting average in the league at 16 and hit four home runs in the ORGANIZATION 18U Pan American Championship in 2014. He later was named to the all-tournament team in the 18-and-under World Cup in GPE in 2015.Playing for PERSON de Avila in GPE's PERSON, the island's top league, PERSON hit .393 with 12 home runs and 11 stolen bases last season. He was also part of the GPE team that played against the Canadian-American League last summer. The 19-game tour included stops in GPE, GPE, and GPE, PERSON left GPE last ORGANIZATIONvember and later established residency in GPE. He was declared a free agent by PERSON on April 20, making him eligible to sign May 20.",0
" There is no one in the Philliesâ system with more tools than GPE. The young shortstop has plus speed, an 8 on the 2-8 scouting scale, and it works for him on both sides of the ball. He led the organization in stolen bases in 2012 and that was in a short-season league. But heâs far more than just a runner. GPE could develop into a plus hitter in time, one who hits .300 annually at the big league level. He has a good approach at the plate and understands his job will be to get on base. The switch-hitter has some pop as well and eventually could have average power. He made a lot of progress at shortstop, a new position for him after playing the outfield in high school and he has the arm and range to be above-average defensively there. The sky might be the limit for GPE; now itâs all about reaching that ceiling as he moves toward GSP.",1
"PERSON was used as both a starter and reliever at ORGANIZATION last year, before eventually assuming a full-time bullpen role. The ORGANIZATION made him their fourth-round pick, signing him for $488,700, then deployed him as a starter in his pro debut, where he impressed scouts with his feel for four pitches.PERSON's fastball sits at 89-92 mph with good arm-side run, and he showed the ability to reach back for a few more ticks as a reliever. The right-hander's slider has the potential to be above average, thrown with power and depth in the mid-80s, and he keeps hitters off balance with an average curveball. PERSON's fringy changeup is his least-advanced offering, although it stands to improve with increased use as a starter.PERSON's deep arsenal and overall pitchability bode well for him becoming a big league starter. Should that not pan out, though, the fastball-slider combo is good enough to make him a setup man.",0
"Hailing from the same ORGANIZATION team that produced PERSON and PERSON, PERSON received a $700,000 bonus as a 16-year-old in 2015, the largest bonus handed out by the ORGANIZATION in the 2015 international period. He's made enormous progress in his first two seasons en route to reaching full-season Class A Fort Wayne in late 2017 after a breakout performance with PERSON Tri-City. PERSON was even more impressive in the ORGANIZATION, where, as the circuit's youngest player, he pitched to a 1.04 ERA, allowing just four hits while striking out 11 in 8 2/3 innings across nine appearances. An elbow injury limited PERSON at the outset of the 2018 season, but he returned fully healthy in mid-June and made the jump straight to Double-A two weeks later.The epitome of a power-armed reliever, PERSON owns the best fastball in GPE's system and is one of the hardest throwers in the ORGANIZATION. He offered a glimpse at that impressive velocity in the ORGANIZATION, where he consistently pumped upper-90s heat and was up to 101 mph with a fastball that showed explosive late life. His hard slider in the upper 80s gives PERSON a second dynamic offering, one that should continue to improve along with his feel for pitching. PERSON did make gains as a strike-thrower in 2017, but his high-effort delivery and issues in repeating his arm slot still leads to well-below-average control, as evidenced by his 6.7 walks-per-nine in two professional seasons. With even modest improvement on that front, PERSON could soon jump on the fast track to becoming a closer in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"GPE's velo was on the rise just before the draft, averaging just over 90 for the first time in his career, but in the postseason was back to 87-91 when he had to rely more on finesse.",0
"GPE has pitched full seasons the last two years for PERSON and walked only single digits each year, thanks to his plus command, which makes the most of his solid average stuff.",0
"PERSON originially joined the D-backs back in Dec. 14 as part of the three-team trade that sent him and PERSON from GPE to GPE and made PERSON a ORGANIZATION. His hopes on following up on a solid 2016 season that saw him reach Double-A for the first time were dashed by a shoulder injury that required surgery, keeping him off the field for all but 23 games in 2017. PERSON is once again healthy and ready to start working his way up to GPE. The switch-hitter has a really strong contact-first approach and has greatly improved his plate discipline and willingness to take walks. He may never be a huge power guy, though that tool is often the last to come, but with his new selectivity, he started tapping into his raw power for more extra-base authority and could be a double-digit home run guy in the big leagues. While he's played mostly shortstop, he's shown he can more than handle second base.PERSON eventually should settle in to being a solid utility player, though if more power comes, seeing him at second every day shouldn't be too surprising. For now, though, he'll focus on staying healthy and putting the shoulder issue in his rearview mirror.",1
"The son of former ORGANIZATION player PERSON, PERSON caught scouts' attention with his strength and athleticism as a high school player in GPE. He began to turn that into performance at ORGANIZATION A Wisconsin in 2013, and he's built on that this season in ORGANIZATION A Advanced PERSON County.PERSON's contact-oriented approach and solid speed make him a natural fit at the top of the order. He hasn't shown much power yet, but some scouts believe it will eventually come. PERSON has played all three outfield positions, and he is a solid defender.PERSON probably isn't an everyday center fielder, but his strong arm and good routes make a good fit in right field. That puts more pressure on his bat to make him a big league regular.",1
"PERSON's spot atop 2017 Draft boards was initially hurt by minor knee surgery the fall before his junior year and slightly lackluster stuff as a result at the start of his season. He did finish strongly and dominated in the ORGANIZATION World Series shortly after the ORGANIZATION feel he dropped in their lap at ORGANIZATION. 18 overall in the June Draft. He didn't pitch after signing as PERSON erred on the side of caution.By the end of his final season with GPE, PERSON was back to full strength, featuring his plus fastball and one of the best sliders in the class. He'll sit around 93 mph and touch 95 regularly with good sink. He threw his slider too much in college, but it is a true out pitch that gets a lot of swings and misses. He'll flash a very good changeup, something he'll have to throw more often as a pro. He generally throws strikes, though it's more control than command right now.Even though the ORGANIZATION went slightly over pick value to sign PERSON, he could prove to be a first-round bargain, a top-of-the-Draft talent found in the middle of the round. His Gators teammate A.J. PERSON made it to Double-A in his first full season of pro ball, and PERSON's stuff allowed him to follow a similar fast track.",0
"In the ORGANIZATION' budget-busting 2016 international signing class, PERSON ($1.3 million) was the lesser-paid and, until close to signing day, lesser-regarded prospect when compared to PERSON ($3.9 million). PERSON looked like one of the top players in the class early, tailed off a bit, and then began improving in pro ball, whereas PERSON was a smaller kid with solid tools and advanced feel who slowly developed above average tools after GPE had locked him up at a lower price. PERSON has filled out some in the intervening time, and has sneaky raw power that may be above average at maturity. That, in combination with clearly above average bat control and enough patience that PERSON lays off pitcher's pitches, is a rare combination for an 18-year-old middle infielder. You can see why GPE pushed him to Hi-A and why he continued performing. PERSON is an above average runner and thrower but may not stick at shortstop, in which case he'll be fine at second base. There's a shot PERSON continues hitting this year, mixes in more game power, and becomes a top-50 prospect in the game, so he'll be one to monitor closely early in 2019.",0
"On the ORGANIZATION and in the first half of his junior spring, PERSON looked like a solid third round prospect, a pitchability lefty sitting 88-92 mph with mostly average stuff, and above-average feel and command. In the month or so leading up to the draft, PERSON's velo ticked up, and down the stretch he sat 92-94, touching 95 mph deep into starts, with an assortment of offspeed pitches that all flashed above-average. The track record of GPE arms is concerning, but PERSON seemed less beholden to the issues traditionally associated with their prospects, with some scouts considering him endearingly rebellious. 
He throws a cutter, slider, curveball, and changeup that all flash above-average, with the slider occasionally flashing plus. He was 93-95 this spring, so the velo uptick has held for nearly a year now. He's a potential No. 4 if this continues, maybe more if it's just the start of something.",0
"GPE and undrafted out of an ORGANIZATION high school three years ago, PERSON has blossomed at ORGANIZATION and not only is a lock to join PERSON (1988) and PERSON (1989) as ORGANIZATION selected in the top 10 picks, but he's also the prohibitive favorite to go No. 1 overall. He has the best combination of stuff and control among college pitchers in the 2018 Draft, and he has proven he can stay healthy. PERSON down last spring at ORGANIZATION and again during the summer with PERSON with a tired arm and a flexor strain in his forearm, he has had no issues this year.PERSON can get swings and misses with three different pitches, the best of which is a mid-80s splitter that dives at the plate. He sets it up with a 92-97 mph fastball that he commands exceptionally well despite its running life. His mid-80s slider has taken a step forward this spring, consistently grading as a plus offering, and he also has developed the ability to turn it into a harder cutter when he desires.PERSON has an athletic frame and a clean delivery, so there's no glaring flaw that can be blamed for his health concerns. He pounds the strike zone, ranking first in ORGANIZATION Division I in K/BB ratio (12.1) and fourth in walks per nine innings (1.0) as a sophomore and posting similar numbers as a junior. PERSON also love the way he competes on the mound.",0
"The GPE Junior National team annually heads to GPE in the spring to escape the cold north and get some baseball in. Stops are often made in GPE, the ORGANIZATION' Spring Training home, so they had seen PERSON plenty before the GPE. When his stock soared as the spring wore on, they were sure to nab him at the end of the first round.The 6-foot-4 right-hander brings an exciting mixture of stuff and feel for pitching to the table, with the work he put in with former big leaguer and PERSON pitching coach PERSON really paying off. His fastball sits in the low-90s and he commands it well. He can really spin his breaking ball and has a good feel for a changeup. He absolutely pounds the strike zone and could have above-average command when all is said and done. Wise beyond his years, he takes things like nutrition and conditioning seriously.Ask a young pitcher what they want to accomplish in the big leagues, and they might mention All-Star appearances or PERSON. PERSON's answer is much more workmanlike: to throw 200 innings annually. He has the ingredients to make that happen.",1
"The Royals have aggressively pushed the son of former ORGANIZATION of the Year and All-Star PERSON since signing him for $2 million out of the ORGANIZATION in 2011. He made his GPE debut at age 16 and was the high Class A ORGANIZATION's only 18-year-old regular in 2014. While his tools are apparent, he looked in over his head against much more advanced pitchers in the ORGANIZATION and PERSON League.A switch-hitter with a line-drive stroke from both sides of the plate, PERSON could grow into annual 15-homer power once he matures physically. He's overly aggressive at the plate, a trait opponents have been able to exploit, as evidenced by his CL-worst .256 on-base percentage and his 17 games without a walk in the ORGANIZATION. If he can develop more patience he can be a significant basestealing threat with his well above-average speed.PERSON is much more polished defensively at this point. He has classic shortstop actions and the range, hands and arm to make all the plays at the position. If he gets a chance to catch his breath and let his bat develop, he could blossom into an All-Star.",1
" PERSON has been in the spotlight since signing out of the ORGANIZATION in 2009. While his pro career is still relatively in its nascent stages, one thing is clear: reports of PERSON's power have not been exaggerated. It's easily plus and it shows up in games now, with more coming. He can hit the ball out of any park to all fields, and while he swings and misses a good amount, he improved his plate discipline and is drawing more walks. His defense is a bigger question mark. PERSON is a big young man, but he is fairly agile and does have the tools -- particularly a plus arm -- to stay there. He will need, however, to improve his footwork and focus in order to do so. PERSON turns just 20 in 2013, so there's no reason to rush him, with the payoff being a very special run producer at the hot corner.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"In a year where college bats with a track record of performance were hard to come by, PERSON's offensive potential had many teams interested as the GPE approached.PERSON has shown an ability to have quality at-bats and make consistent hard contact with outstanding bat speed. He has a bat that should provide both average and some power as he progresses. A slightly above-average runner, PERSON has played left field as a junior at GPE, but could have the goods to play center field, one who takes good routes and has enough arm for a corner if needed. PERSON plays with confidence in all aspects of his game.PERSON hasn't set the world on fire as a junior, though he's shown more power than he had previously. That, plus the dearth of advanced bats, could see him come off the board in the top three rounds.",1
"Often interested in college bats in the first round of the GPE, the ORGANIZATION discussed taking PERSON with their first pick in 2013. PERSON went one pick ahead of them, to the ORGANIZATION, and PERSON went with college outfielder PERSON. The ORGANIZATION were able to bring PERSON to the organization last December in the ORGANIZATION Chapman deal.Fans of PERSON are believers in his bat. Injuries, including one to his knee in 2015, have kept him off the field, but his numbers projected out over full seasons would indeed be impressive. That's particularly true of his power stats, with 82 extra-base hits in just over 200 professional games. PERSON will draw some walks and his ORGANIZATION has always been high, but his propensity for strikeouts might keep him from hitting for too high of an average. Whether PERSON can stick at third remains to be seen, however, most see a move across the diamond to first in his future.PERSON's injuries have been fluky and unrelated and the ORGANIZATION feel they may have been buying low on him. Having hit in pitching environments previously, they are confident his left-handed swing will play very well at FACILITY.",0
"PERSON fell out of the top 10 rounds of last year's draft due to questions about his signability, hit tool, and age relative to his peers. He was almost 19 on draft day, which, combined with the strikeout issues, moved him way down the boards of teams who care about those variables, especially together. He ended up signing for a very reasonable $500,000, then hit .362 against ORGANIZATION pitching and was eventually promoted to the ORGANIZATION. 
He's an advanced defender with an 80 arm (the teams most bearish on his bat in high school wanted to see him on the mound) and above-average raw power, which PERSON's pre-daft proponents insisted he'd get to despite the strikeouts. We don't know much about the plate discipline aspect of the profile yet. The low end of the spectrum makes the offensive skillset read like PERSON's, but PERSON projects as a better defender.",0
"A reliever for his first two years at FACILITY in GPE, PERSON moved into the rotation as a junior. The right-hander saw his stock rise considerably as he put up tremendous numbers as a Friday night starter in the ORGANIZATION, going 9-3 with a 1.73 ORGANIZATION and a 121-15 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 114 1/3 innings. The GPE made PERSON its third-round pick in June and signed him for a slightly less than pick value.PERSON fills up the strike zone with four different pitches. He lacks velocity, pitching mostly with an average fastball, though he was up to 93-94 mph in relief stints last summer in the ORGANIZATION. His best pitch is his slider/cutter. It's a plus pitch thrown around 88 mph, but with slider action. Without it, he'd be a fairly pedestrian right-hander, given that his curve is fringy and he doesn't use his changeup much.While PERSON's pitchability and command could allow for him to develop into a back-end starter, he also could move quickly through the GPE' system as a reliever based on the strength of his fastball-cutter combination.",1
"PERSON can run, he can throw and he can hit for power.Many scouts believe he has the best overall package of tools in the class. He might also have the best projectable body.The teenager projects to be extremely physical, and he could end up too big to stay in the middle of the infield. It's unclear if his run tool will impact his overall game, but his arm definitely will. PERSON could have a plus arm in the future with plus raw power. He also has shown good bat speed and solid defensive abilities. As a result, PERSON could end up in right field.His bat tool could use some improvement, but that's expected to improve with daily instruction. Moreover, his overall game is expected to improve once he plays in games regularly.PERSON signed a $2.25 million deal with the Royals.",0
"PERSON has long had the stuff to be considered a top prospect, but had trouble staying healthy enough to show he can use those tools to be an effective pitcher. After missing the entire 2014 season, PERSON then largely stayed on the mound over the next three seasons, reaching Triple-A in 2017. The ORGANIZATION left him unprotected and the ORGANIZATION nabbed him in the Rule 5 Draft.PERSON -- the younger brother of PERSON -- has an outstanding fastball thrown around 94 mph that has plus heaviness and angle, leading to ground-ball outs. He complements the fastball with an outstanding slider, a power mid-80s breaking ball. PERSON wasn't able to log a ton of innings early on in his career, but has compiled at least 50 innings in 2015-17.PERSON had starter stuff, but the injury concerns pushed him to the bullpen, where he has stuck to his two power pitches which have led to high strikeout rates. He'll be given every chance to stick in the big leagues as an ORGANIZATION reliever.",0
" PERSON, a high schooler from GPE, is all projection right now. But there's a lot you can dream on. He has the kind of frame scouts like, one that should add strength. That should mean more velocity on his fastball which already touches the low 90s at times. His delivery needs work and when that comes, so will better command. Fairly athletic, he's shown some ability to spin a breaking ball and has some feel for a changeup. The ORGANIZATION have never shied away from such projects, and if they're patient with PERSON, he has all the raw tools that could develop into a frontline type starter.",0
"A college starter, Lingenfelter projects as a two-pitch reliever in pro ball. 91-95, above average slider.",0
"The younger brother of former GPE first-rounder PERSON, PERSON spent three years as part of ORGANIZATION's infield, parlaying his best offensive year as a junior into a fifth-round selection in the 2015 Draft. He promptly set the short-season LOCATION on fire, winning ORGANIZATION honors and the batting title in the process.Jackson didn't hit much until his final season at ORGANIZATION, when he topped .300 for the first time. There's no power to speak of, but he did show a solid approach at the plate during his pro debut, with an ability to make consistent contact and get on base. His 47 stolen bases not only led the LOCATION, but ranked second in the ORGANIZATION organization despite him playing just 59 games and not having blinding speed. He is, however extremely athletic and that helps him on both sides of the ball. His best defensive tool by far, though, is his arm, a pure cannon that could help him stay at ORGANIZATION appeared to fit the profile of a future utility infielder when he was drafted. If he can prove his debut wasn't a mirage, the ORGANIZATION just might have gotten more than they expected.",0
"PERSON shuttled between the bullpen and rotation in three years at GPE, and he came up huge at the end of his college career. He earned ORGANIZATION honors at the 2015 College World Series, winning three games and saving another while throwing 13 scoreless innings in relief. After signing him for $722,500 as a supplemental second-rounder, the ORGANIZATION will try to develop him as a starter.The younger brother of PERSON, who pitched in one big league game with the 2010 Tigers, PERSON works primarily with two pitches. Neither his 91-95 mph fastball nor his slider is truly overpowering, but they both feature late life that makes them hard for hitters to barrel. He didn't use his changeup much coming out of the bullpen but has exhibited some feel for it in the past. PERSON has an unorthodox arm action that adds to his deception, though scouts don't love it and it hampers his control and command. He has a durable frame and could make it as a starter if he enhances his changeup and locates his pitches more consistently.",0
"The team that signs PERSON is going to have a lot to work to do now and in the future.The teenager has lots of raw power -- some evaluators think he has some of the best raw power in the class -- and he is considered a great overall package with lots of tools. There is some swing-and-miss in his approach at times, but PERSON performed well in games in the ORGANIZATION in the GPE, where his instincts and natural abilities took over. He's very athletic with a strong and projectable body.PERSON is known as a decent runner now, and the hope is that he can maintain his speed as his body develops. He has a strong enough arm to play the corner outfield positions, but he'll likely start his professional career in center field. PERSON is from GPE, GPE, and trains with PERSON. The ORGANIZATION are the favorite to sign him.",0
"PERSON hurt his elbow during his senior year of high school, and though he ultimately underwent PERSON surgery, the ORGANIZATION selected him in the 50th round. That decision is beginning to pay off as PERSON turns his promise into results.PERSON's fastball sits in the low-90s, and he commands it effectively to both sides of the plate. He shows some feel for both his curveball and changeup, giving him two more average offerings.Because PERSON doesn't have overwhelming stuff, he has to command all of his pitches to succeed. He's made strides in that area, and if he continues to do so, he'll have a chance to stick as a middle-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"Undrafted and barely recruited out of high school, PERSON was one of the most reliable power hitters in college baseball over the last three seasons. He reached double figures in homers twice and tied for second with six long balls in the ORGANIZATION last summer, which earned him a fourth-round selection in the 2015 Draft and a $400,000 bonus.PERSON is strong and generates good backspin wit his right-handed strokes. He can get pull-happy on occasion but manages the strike zone well and should hit for a decent average.Though he has enough arm strength for third base, PERSON probably will need to find a new position. His throws lack accuracy and his hands and quickness are less than desirable at the hot corner. His well below-average speed figures to land him at first base, though he experimented with catching last fall.",0
"PERSON showed the makings of becoming an offensive-minded second baseman in his first full season, when he hit .320 with 37 extra-base hits between the Class A and Class A Advanced levels. But the 2012 third-round failed to progress at the plate last year in his return to the ORGANIZATION State League, finishing his second full season with a .259 average and just 18 extra-base hits. PERSON's bat-to-ball skills and quick right-handed stroke generate a lot of line-drive contact, and he does a good job of spraying the ball across the whole field. He's aggressive to a fault at times and will force contact rather than work the count, though it also makes him difficult to strike out. PERSON is physically strong and has good pop to the gaps, but he's unlikely to offer much in the way of over-the-fence power.A shortstop in high school, PERSON shifted to second base after turning pro and has shown steady improvement as he's gotten more comfortable at his new position. However, it's his bat that will be his ticket to the ORGANIZATION, and the ORGANIZATION believe he'll get back on track at the plate in 2016.",0
"GPE catching typically is in high demand and short supply. That should work in GPE's favor as he's turned in another solid season behind the plate for PERSON, who served as a backup on ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION over the summer, is primarily a catch-and-throw guy. He has tremendous arm strength and has worked to improve his release time to get the ball down to second even faster. His other defensive skills aren't as advanced as his arm, but he has the tools to be a quality all-around receiver. While he's hit some in college, his offensive game does lag behind his defense at this point, though he'll flash glimpses of some pull power. He is athletic and runs well for a catcher.GPE has the behind-the-plate skills to at least be a strong Major League backup. The team that takes him early will be the one that thinks he'll hit enough to be a regular backstop at the highest level.",0
"PERSON cracked ORGANIZATION's rotation as a true freshman and showed steady improvement before breaking out in the 2014 Cape Cod League. That success continued into his junior season, and the PERSON made him a fifth-round PERSON pick in June. A 6-foot-6 left-hander, PERSON stands out more for his pitchability and command than his stuff, although there's nothing wrong with the latter. He knows how to change eye levels with an 88-92 mph fastball and uses his smooth but deceptive delivery to his advantage. PERSON's best pitch is an above-average changeup that he throws with convincing arm speed from the same slot as his heater, and he also shows the makings of having an average slider, giving him three average-or-better offerings.Athletic and durable, PERSON profiles as back-of-the-rotation workhorse, though he could also jump on the fast track to the big leagues with a move to the bullpen. The PERSON like how he processes the game and competes on the mound, qualities they believe could make him successful in either role.",0
"The only player to appear on three world championship teams for ORGANIZATION, GPE, as a Draft-eligible sophomore at FACILITY, was viewed as one of the more well-rounded college shortstops in the 2016 Draft. The ORGANIZATION selected GPE with the ORGANIZATION. 87 overall pick in the third round, and he signed for $700,000. Making his full-season debut in 2017, GPE, despite being an older player in the ORGANIZATION A ORGANIZATION, showed little impact potential at the plate but excelled with his glove at both middle-infield positions.He rebounded with a strong showing at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Modesto in 2018, and the ORGANIZATION dealt GPE and international pool money to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION. GPE does a lot of things fairly well, though no single tool is plus. He has a solid approach, makes consistent contact from the right side of the plate and can steal some bases now and again. The quality of GPE's contact leaves something to be desired, though, leading some scouts to question whether he'll ever be strong enough to consistently drive the baseball. He's a capable defender at shortstop, though most believe he'll need to move over to second base, where his below-average arm strength is a better fit. But he was impressive with his glove on both sides of the second-base bag in the LOCATION, committing just two errors apiece at the positions. The ORGANIZATION intend to give GPE the chance to stick at short, but his ability to play second should work in his favor and ultimately could help him carve out a role as a quality backup at both spots. To achieve that, however, he'll first need to make gains at the plate.",0
"Well-regarded in high school in part because of his very loose, athletic, albeit somewhat unusual delivery, the ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON in the 2015 second round. PERSON broke down and PERSON went to GPE. After an uneven but promising freshman year in the bullpen, PERSON's command improved and he carved up ORGANIZATION lineups for the next two years. There's plenty to pick apart here if you want to: PERSON's stuff still isn't loud, he doesn't get many whiffs from pro level hitters, his delivery turns off some scouts, and his breaking ball often lacks bite. 
Even scouts who like PERSON think he has limited upside, but the results he got in the ORGANIZATION and his long track record of durability are compelling. He has great feel for pitching and, we think, future plus command. PERSON sneers and goes right at hitters, he's really competitive, and is likely to move up the pro ladder quickly. On talent, he's a No. 4 or No. 4/5 type of starter, but the potential to eat tons of innings, and therefore be more valuable than that, seems higher than usual here, too.",0
"PERSON is a superb talent who can't help but take max-effort swings at just about everything. His approach and early-career maturity issues (which have improved but still exist) slowed his development a bit and he only has half a season at Double-A despite being 23 and having played pro ball for six seasons. But PERSON has great bat speed, power, and an innate feel for impacting the bottom of the baseball and lifting it into the air. If he weren't so aggressive (he appeared to be under a mandate to see more pitches in 2018) he'd be an easy plus future hit, plus future power center field prospect in the middle of our top 100. But the volatility created by the impatience, combined with PERSON's noticeably thicker 2018 frame, has created apprehension. His upside is huge, but so is the risk. Ultimately, he shares many traits with Phillies outfielder PERSON (though PERSON's a better defender by a wide margin), and, like PERSON, PERSON might just be such an amazing offensive talent that he'll be fine eventually despite his issues and several developmental bumps in the road.  ",0
"GPE's talent could have made him a seventh- to 10th-round pick in the 2014 Draft, but questions about his signability dropped him all the way to the 26th round. He was one of the top hitters in the first half of the ORGANIZATION summer season, which earned him a $150,000 bonus from the Giants.Though GPE began his first full pro season in low Class A, his productive bat quickly earned him a pair of promotions and landed him in Double-A before the end of June. He combines bat speed and strength and could produce both average and power if he can make consistent contact. His swing can get long, and he struggles against quality breaking pitches.A below-average runner with an average arm, GPE is still seeking a permanent defensive home. He played third base and all three outfield spots in college at GPE, saw action on all four corners in his pro debut and has split time between second base and the outfield corners in 2015. The most likely scenario is that he'll wind up in left field.",0
"Breakout performances at the LOCATION Professional Showcase and the ORGANIZATION Games last summer positioned PERSON as a first-round pick for 2015. Though he didn't quite live up to expectations as a senior, he still went 23rd overall to the ORGANIZATION and became the first ORGANIZATION high school position player taken in the top three rounds since PERSON in 2004. Signed for $2,124,400, PERSON has above-average hitting ability and power potential. He has a quick left-handed swing and a mature approach, stroking balls from gap to gap while showing advanced pitch recognition and plate discipline. He's an average runner with some savvy on the bases.There's a split camp on whether PERSON can stay in center field, because he lacks the typical speed for the position but overcomes that with good instincts. If he has to move, he'll probably wind up in left field because of his lackluster arm.",0
"Injuries have plagued PERSON since college. His back, his elbow, a Tommy PERSON, more back, the shoulder, more elbow. The ORGANIZATION pared down his repertoire and transitioned him into a multi-inning relief role fairly early in 2018. He was shut down with injury in July. In the fall, his velocity was back in the mid-90s but his secondary stuff wasn't as crisp. PERSON injured list stints early in his career, PERSON would flash No. 3 starter stuff. There's a chance that comes back, but the injury history is suppressing how he's viewed compared to other prospects and will likely impact the way PERSON develops him, as evidenced by the 2018 bullpen move.",0
"PERSON pitched out of GPE's bullpen for most of his college career, but scouts got excited when he took his full repertoire to the rotation as a junior. That turned him into a first-round pick and the ORGANIZATION nabbed him at ORGANIZATION. 19 overall. After struggling a bit in his first full season, the right-hander went back to the ORGANIZATION State League and pitched his way to Double-A in 2018. The ORGANIZATION noticed the rebound and acquired him as part of the package for PERSON and PERSON in December.There hasn't been any issue with PERSON's stuff since he entered pro ball. He'll sit in the 93-95 mph range with his fastball and can reach back for more at times. He does have a pair of breaking balls, with his slider ahead of the curve. He'll throw the harder slider with good late bite and it looked like a plus pitch for him at its best in 2018. PERSON is still working to develop his changeup, though he shows some feel for it. He's made progress in getting left-handed hitters out, using that third pitch more effectively at times.While PERSON's overall command and control have been inconsistent in his brief career, the ORGANIZATION feel they saw a better strike-thrower as he got settled in during his bounce-back 2018 campaign. He is athletic, which should help him repeat his delivery. Staying healthy helped PERSON take a nice step toward his ceiling as a mid-rotation big league starter.",0
"Selected by the ORGANIZATION in the fourth round of the 2011 Draft out of PERSON (Fla.) CC, PERSON spent the first three seasons of his career in GPE ball before a breakout 2014 full-season debut at ORGANIZATION A Quad Cities. After the ORGANIZATION acquired him last May in exchange for two international bonus slots, PERSON enjoyed success at both ORGANIZATION A Advanced PERSON and Double-A Bowie. Following the season, PERSON added him to its 40-man roster. He returned to the LOCATION in 2016 and won five of his seven starts before landing on the disabled list in late May with soreness in the muscle area of his left shoulder. The left-hander attempted to throw a bullpen in early July, only to have his session shut down due to ongoing discomfort.PERSON works in the 91-94 range with his fastball and can reach back for a few extra ticks, throwing the pitch down in the zone with late life and running action. The slider has two variations: one with short, tight action in the mid- to upper-80s; the other in the 82-85 mph range with more traditional sweeping action. PERSON's changeup lags behind the two offerings, which has caused problems against right-handed hitters throughout his career.That the ORGANIZATION adjusted PERSON's mechanics following the trade contributed to his success as starter in 2015, as it allowed the left-hander to make better use of his athleticism and repeat his delivery with more consistency. PERSON will need to continue to make strides with both his changeup and control to break through as a starter, but his strong track record against lefties could help him carve out a bullpen role in the coming year.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 14, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON, a GPE commit, was selected as a 2015 Perfect Game Underclass High Honorable Mention and as a member of the 2016 Perfect Game Underclass Second Team.PERSON has an aggressive approach at the plate, and while he spins off contact occasionally as a result, he also boasts power potential thanks to his quick bat and strength. While he needs more time to develop, PERSON has room for growth.",0
"At times PERSON has shown three above-average pitches and looked like a potential No. 4/5 starter, but his stuff was very hittable during his 2018 big league debut and he dealt with reduced stuff and elbow issues during the spring of 2019. He was shut down and given a ORGANIZATION injection with hopes of avoiding PERSON. He should start throwing again in May. Should he ultimately need ORGANIZATION, we wouldn't see PERSON again until 2021.",1
"PERSON had some of the most intriguing tools among high school players in the 2014 Draft, and he would have gone in the top three rounds had he not been set on attending ORGANIZATION. Three years after turning down the ORGANIZATION as a 30th-round selection, he easily has the best all-around tools of any college player in the 2017 Draft. He showcased his abilities with the GPE collegiate national team last summer, leading the squad in hits (20), extra-base hits (10), ORGANIZATION (14) and steals (five), and he set a career high this spring with 15 homers entering ORGANIZATION tournament play.A fast-twitch athlete with five-tool potential, PERSON stands out most with his plus-plus speed and also possesses deceptive strength. He has learned to incorporate his lower half in his left-handed swing while at ORGANIZATION and has good balance at the plate. There's more swing and miss in PERSON's game than scouts would like, leading to some concerns about his pitch recognition and whether he'll reach his offensive upside.There are no worries about PERSON's defense, because he has the instincts and quickness to cover both gaps. He also knows how to use his speed on the bases. PERSON's overall game draws comparisons to that of PERSON, though his arm is significantly stronger.",0
"The ORGANIZATION Diego-area high school standout jumped up ORGANIZATION boards after a tremendous summer showcasing his present stuff and his projectability. A knee injury suffered in January set him back, with some scouts thinking he returned to the mound a little too soon.When PERSON did first come back, his stuff wasn't nearly as sharp as it had been over the summer, though it was slowly rounding back into shape the further removed from the injury he became. PERSON has a strong and projectable 6-foot-4 frame, with quick and loose actions on the mound. When 100 percent, he already touches 94 mph, with potentially more in the tank. He complements that with both a breaking ball and changeup that could be plus in time. Throwing from a three-quarters slot, his breaking ball is identified as a curve, but might have more slider action to it when all is said and done. He can really pull the string on his changeup and he does a very good job of throwing strikes with all three of his pitches.Based on his summer, it looked like PERSON would certainly get drafted early enough to bypass his commitment to LOCATION, even with a need to gain more consistency with his delivery and a need to add durability. That still could happen, even with his sluggish start to the spring, if teams feel his summer was the real deal.",0
"Sometimes hitters put up power numbers in college and it doesn't translate to the pro game. That hasn't been the case so far for GPE, the ORGANIZATION product who hit 41 homers in his ORGANIZATION career, then hit 51 homers over his first two full seasons of pro ball. He was representing the D-backs in the ORGANIZATION League when he was traded to the ORGANIZATION for catcher PERSON. PERSON is definitely GPE's standout tool. He generates it more with strength than with bat speed from the left side of the plate and there are holes in his swing that have led to high strikeout totals. He is willing to take walks, however, with the potential of being a three true outcomes kind of run producer. He's a fringe-average runner who is a better athlete than what he might appear to be. He's an adequate defensive first baseman and has also seen considerable time in right field.GPE will have to prove he can hit enough to tap into his raw power in order to profile well as a big league regular at first. It will be fun to see how his home run potential develops as he moves up the ladder.",0
"After saving a school-record 28 games in his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION, PERSON had some success as a starter in the ORGANIZATION and moved into the ORGANIZATION rotation as a junior in 2016. But he went 2-10 with a 4.86 ERA, his stuff regressed and he slid to the FACILITY in the 11th round. He immediately found success once returning to the bullpen in pro ball and advanced to the big leagues in a little more than two years, though he had a disastrous 2019 during which he injured his shoulder in a car accident in March and saw his season end when a line drive broke his jaw in June and necessitated multiple surgeries.PERSON's fastball dipped into the low-90s with less life when he was a starter, but in shorter stints it's back to sitting in the mid-90s, reaching triple digits and featuring heavy sink. His power slider ranges from 87-90 mph and has become a consistent plus offering. He'll mix in a changeup to combat left-handers and flash some average ones at times, though it got hammered in his brief introduction to the Majors.PERSON's control got shaky at times in college and early in his pro career, but he has done a much better job of challenging hitters the past two seasons. He keeps the ball down in the strike zone, a necessity for someone who will work high-leverage innings at ORGANIZATION. He could emerge as GPE's closer once he returns to full health.",1
"ORGANIZATION was a high-profile prep pitcher in south GPE before the 2015 draft, and the main question about him focused on his rail-thin 6-foot-5, 160 pound frame. If you thought he would put on a good bit of weight, then you could see him adding velocity to his 88-92 mph heater. But the question was whether he would have enough stuff and durability to start if he stayed about the same size. He's filled out some since the ORGANIZATION took him in the comp round in 2015, but it looks like he's always going to be very thin. 
His velocity has crept up a bit to 90-93, hitting 95 mph, but the life, plane, deception, extension, and command combine to make the fastball an above average pitch now. The additional arm speed has helped his breaker improve; it flashes plus at times. And he's kept the positive attributes scouts originally noticed in his delivery and the athleticism, so the command may also end up being plus. The changeup is a 45, so his curve, pitchability, and deception are the carrying tools we think will turn him into a league average starter. ORGANIZATION also had his first pro injury in 2018, and his strikeout rate was down in his first taste of Double-A, before he had upper back issues that have him on the shelf to start 2019. So long as his stuff in intact upon return, we think he's a No. 4 starter with a chance to be a No. 3.",0
"A thoroughly modern hitter, PERSON has above-average ball/strike recognition for his age, and everything about his swing is geared for power. While he takes the occasional, gorgeous uppercut rip, it's clear his feel for contact is undercooked from both sides of the plate, something that won't be helped by a recent thumb fracture and ligament tear that may cost him most of this season. He's increasingly likely to max out as a 40 hitter, or thereabouts, which makes it imperative that PERSON learn to attack pitches he can drive and take his share of walks. 
An amateur shortstop -- he signed for $1.9 million with the ORGANIZATION in their deep 2016 July 2nd class but was declared a free agent due to the ORGANIZATIONâ violations in the international realm, then signed for an additional $2.5 million bonus with PERSON -- PERSON made all of seven 2019 starts at second base before hurting his thumb, and should settle in there. He could be a three true outcomes middle infielder a la PERSON, or peak PERSON and PERSON.",0
"ORGANIZATION had a pair of pitchers from its staff get drafted in the top five rounds in 2015, with PERSON going No. 4 overall and PERSON landing in the fifth. PERSON, a three-year starter, continued that trend in 2016 when he signed with GPE as its fourth-round pick. PERSON is the epitome of the advanced, yet not exciting, college arm. A Sunday starter a year ago, the right-hander served as ORGANIZATION's Friday night starter in 2016, after his strong showing in the ORGANIZATION last summer. The right-hander lacks a true out pitch but effectively employs three average offerings. He generally pitches around 90-91 mph with his heater, but there could be some more velocity to unlock at the next level. He mixes in a solid slider and changeup and demonstrates exemplary control of all three pitches.A lack of a true out pitch limits PERSON's ceiling, but his polish, durability and track record suggests that he could move quickly.",1
"A native of GPE, PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION as a 16-year-old in 2009. After a productive 2014 season with PERSON, he was acquired by the ORGANIZATION as a part of the January trade that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON turned around and traded him the following offseason along with PERSON to the Angels.While PERSON improved as a hitter in 2014, as he began using the whole field more and ironed out some flaws in his setup at the plate, he regressed in 2015. He does have some loft in his swing, which could allow him to tap into his raw power. Behind the plate, PERSON is still developing as a receiver. He has above-average arm strength and has thrown out 40 percent of would-be basestealers in his career. He still has work to do, but PERSON's tools give him the chance to develop into a big league backstop in time.",0
"It wasn't until his fourth summer after signing that PERSON made it to full-season ball, but he made it count, winning the organizational batting title while also topping the system in hits and stolen bases in 2014. He's followed it up with a strong performance in 2015.A terrific athlete, PERSON plays a high energy brand of game that in many ways makes him the most exciting player in the organization to watch. At the plate, he's all about making contact. He has a very handsy approach and has shown an ability to hit well with two strikes, getting low in his stance and continuing to put the ball in play with authority. As a result, he doesn't strike out a ton. PERSON has flashed some power, and there might be more to come, though he's more of a line-drive hitter now. A tick-above-average runner, his instincts and aggressiveness help him on the basepaths. He's also shown he can play all three outfield positions well. PERSON's energy can get in the way at times, but he should learn how to keep it in check when necessary as he matures.",1
"At age 18, PERSON established himself as the favorite to win 2014-15 Rookie of the Year honors in GPE's top league before defecting that April. The ORGANIZATION spent $31 million to sign him seven months later, $15.5 million for his bonus and an equal amount in penalty tax. He spent most of his first two pro years holding his own as one of the youngest regulars in the high Class A GPE, then batted .333/.390/.491 in Double-A during the final month of the 2017 season. Returning to Double-A in 2018, PERSON made across-the-board improvements at the plate during the first half and then showcased his abilities to a national audience by hitting a pair of impressive home runs in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON. His progress caught the attention of the GPE, who acquired PERSON along with four other prospects in a 5-for-1 deal for PERSON at the All-Star break. PERSON shows the potential for solid tools across the board with the exception of his power, although he has begun to show more pop after toning down his setup and incorporating his lower half more in his right-handed swing. He makes consistent barreled contact, driving the ball with authority to all fields, with enough bat speed and strength to provide 12-15 per season. PERSON could very well surpass those power projections, especially after he tightened his approach and drastically reduced his chase rate during his return to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON has above-average speed but has yet to show much prowess as a basestealer. He spent most of his pro debut in center field, where he projected as an average defender. He's likely a better long-term fit in right field, where he played the majority of last year, and has the arm for the position.",0
"The last high schooler from GPE to do anything of note in the pro game was PERSON, now a starter in the ORGANIZATION rotation. He was drafted back in 2006. ORGANIZATION provides the FACILITY's first real hope from the prep ranks since then.ORGANIZATION definitely has some tools to help him make an impact. He can really hit, with a line-drive approach and more power to come as he matures. He has very good speed from the right side of the plate and is a threat on the basepaths. That speed gives him the chance to stay in center field and he has more than enough arm for the position. He's strong, stocky and athletic.ORGANIZATION was making some noise as the weather warmed in GPE and his tools could have him off the board in the top five rounds.",0
"The ORGANIZATION of the 2014 Connie Mack World Series, PERSON hit a key two-run double and pitched 3 1/3 scoreless innings to win the championship game. He has the most electric arm in GPE this spring but showed little feel for harnessing it until late in the season.The PERSON recruit has a strong 6-foot-3, 240-pound frame and a very quick arm, and when he keeps his mechanics under control he looks like a future ace. PERSON can work at 93-95 mph fastball and hit 98, with some late life when he keeps it down in the zone. His curveball can be a true 12-to-6 hammer and reach the mid-80s.The problem is that PERSON can't hold his delivery together, often flying open and overthrowing. That causes his fastball to straighten out and his curve to lose its shape, and prevents him from keeping either pitch near the strike zone. He has yet to show much aptitude for throwing a changeup.",0
"PERSON GPE has sent nine pitchers to the big leagues since 2001, and PERSON could join the club despite being unimposing on the mound. He led ORGANIZATION Division I with a 1.01 ERA in 2012. PERSON had streaks of 38 1/3 straight scoreless innings and 73 consecutive without an earned run. After a strong encore in 2013, he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $40,000 as a ninth-round pick.PERSON has continued to work his magic in pro ball, as he would have led the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League ERA with a 1.62 ERA in his pro debut if he hadn't fallen just short of qualifying. He got off to a hot start in 2014, swiftly reaching high Class A while continuing to get outs with his outstanding pitchability.PERSON usually pitches at 87-88 mph with his fastball, which plays up because of his ability to locate it wherever he wants. His lone plus offering is his changeup, and he can keep hitters off balance by throwing a curveball and a cutter for strikes. Based on pure stuff, it's hard to project PERSON as a big league starter, but based on his track record of blowing away expecations, it would be silly to bet against him.",0
"PERSON was sitting in the mid-80s as a rising junior but got himself into excellent physical shape and was touching 97 at showcase events last summer. He has an average curveball, below average changeup and lacks the mechanical grace and fluidity of most of his peers.",0
"PERSON intrigued scouts with his athleticism before arriving at the ORGANIZATION in GPE, and his breakout performance there will earn him a seven-figure bonus -- if he's willing to sign. Also a four-star wide receiver recruit, he's committed to play football and baseball at FACILITY, where his father PERSON is a defensive line coach. PERSON believe he may prefer to play football, though some will consider him in the first round if they believe he can be lured away from the ORGANIZATION Heels.After looking overmatched at times on the showcase circuit last summer, PERSON had no problem handling quality pitching at the ORGANIZATION. He made repeated hard contact with his quick right-handed swing and displayed at least average raw power. He employs a big leg kick and doesn't have much track record offensively, but he has the upside of a solid hitter with 15-20 homers per year.PERSON' most explosive tool is his speed, which earns top-of-the-scale 80 grades from some evaluators. Just with his sheer quickness, PERSON can steal bases and cover a lot of ground in center field, and he potentially could be elite in both areas if he devoted his full attention to baseball. He has fringy arm strength, which is more than playable in center, and it could improve if he got on a throwing program.",1
"The top catcher in the 2013 GPE class, ORGANIZATION was ranked ORGANIZATION. 10 on MLB.com's PERSON 100 at the time of the GPE. Many thought the ORGANIZATION were eyeing him for their first pick, at ORGANIZATION. 9, so they were no doubt thrilled when he was available at ORGANIZATION. 14. The left-handed hitting catcher is the complete package. ORGANIZATION is strong-bodied with some projection to his frame, which could lead to more power to go along with a very solid hit tool. Behind the plate, ORGANIZATION has a plus arm and a very quick exchange, leaving no doubt about his ability to stay behind the plate. He gets high marks for his all-out effort and should be a leader behind the plate for the ORGANIZATION.",1
"In some ways, PERSON is a college arm stuck in a high schooler's body. He has a really advanced feel for a prepster. He has a three-pitch mix that won't wow you in terms of pure stuff, but it's solid average across the board. Both his changeup and perhaps even his curve have the chance to be better than average in the future. His fastball has a lot of sink and will sit in the 90-93 mph range. He has very good command, showing the ability to locate and move the ball around the zone. While he will be just 19 for all of the 2013 season, his pitchability may allow him to move a little faster than many high school draftees.",1
"PERSON made a name for himself on the national stage last summer, winning the junior portion of the All-Star Game Home Run Derby by bashing 13 homers with a metal bat at ORGANIZATION. A month later, he won the Derby at the Under PERSON All-America Game at FACILITY Field.PERSON has tremendous power and bat speed, not to mention quality athleticism and arm strength. Whether he realizes that upside depends on how much he develops at the plate and how much weight he'll eventually pack on his lean 6-foot-5 frame. PERSON weren't sold on PERSON's pure hitting ability, and his busy setup at the plate can affect his timing.PERSON definitely has the arm for shortstop, but his speed and defense may not be more than average, which could eventually lead to a move to third base.",0
"PERSON had as much helium as any position player in the last couple of weeks before the 2014 Draft. The ORGANIZATION felt fortunate to get him with the 23rd overall pick in June and signed him for $2 million. Now he'll try to go one step further than his father PERSON, who topped out in Triple-A as an outfielder and now scouts for the Dodgers.Derek stands out most with his plus-plus speed. He can run the 60-yard dash in less than 6.4 second, and his quickness gives him tremendous range in center field and allows him to be a disruptive force on the bases.PERSON has some offensive potential to go with his speed. He has the bat speed and strike-zone discipline to hit for average, and he should have solid gap power once he fills out. As a bonus, he throws better than most center fielders.",0
"PERSON noticed PERSON at ORGANIZATION Thomas More High (PERSON, GPE.) while scouting eventual Royals supplemental first-rounder Chase Vallot in 2014, and he developed into the state's best prep prospect for 2015. He went undrafted, however, because he wanted to attend his local college. Three years later, he should become the first Louisiana-PERSON pitcher selected in the first five rounds since the turn of the century.PERSON created a stir by hitting 98 mph in mid-March after missing a month with an oblique injury, though he usually pitches at 91-94 with some run and angle on his fastball. He has aptitude for spin, throwing a curveball with power and depth and morphing it into a slider at times. He also has an effective changeup to combat right-handers.While he possesses four pitches, PERSON also has a lot of work to do to remain a starter at the next level. He lacks reliable command, and he loses velocity and location on his fastball at times when he falls in love with his breaking pitches. He also has a history of nagging injuries, leading to questions about his durability.",0
"Signed at age 18 by the Mariners in July 2014, PERSON made an impressive GPE debut in 2015, reaching the short-season ORGANIZATION at age 19. PERSON sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in November in the deal for PERSON Benoit.PERSON has already shown rapid improvement since he began his pro career, and there might be plenty more left in the tank. His fastball will sit in the low 90s, but he can reach back for more velocity at times. He throws it with plenty of life down in the zone, generating a good amount of groundball outs. He has the chance to have at least an average curveball, which he can throw for strikes, and his changeup shows glimpses of being an above-average offspeed pitch. PERSON is around the plate and missed plenty of bats during his pro debut and should improve with further refinement of his command.The right-hander has room to add strength to his 6-foot-3 frame, which could lead to more velocity in the future. He might be far off from being big league ready, but the ORGANIZATION might have found a steal.",1
"PERSON was deemed untouchable by ORGANIZATION managing general partner PERSON in 2015, including him in a group with more hyped prospects PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON. A 13th-round pick in 2012 who signed for $100,000 out of GPE, PERSON didn't allow a run in 11 appearances following a September callup that year and earned a spot on GPE's PERSON roster. But his struggles across three stints in the Majors, as well his two-plus months spent on the Triple-A disabled list with an undisclosed injury, caused the ORGANIZATION to change their tone following the 2016 season, when they dealt PERSON to Seattle for right-hander Zack Littell.PERSON has an unorthodox delivery that adds life and deception to his pitches, making him almost unhittable when he throws strikes. He sits at 93-95 mph and can reach 98 with his fastball, backing it up with a true slider in the low 80s. He also has a changeup he can use to cross up hitters.PERSON hit few speed bumps in the Minors, recording a 2.30 ERA with 243 strikeouts and just five homers allowed in 215 1/3 innings in five seasons. He missed time at the beginning of 2013 and 2015 seasons with shoulder issues, but if he can stay healthy and avoid his occasional control lapses, he stands to help bolster the ORGANIZATION' bullpen. Meanwhile, his track record against lefties and righties gives PERSON more upside than a mere situational reliever.",1
"PERSON might be the most confounding pitching prospect in baseball. He didn't focus full-time on the mound until 2011, when he was a supplemental first-round pick out of a GPE high school, and his upside and lack of polish remain evident in his fifth year in pro ball. PERSON's strong build allows him to maintain a 93-97 mph on his fastball, which can reach as high as 99 and also features heavy sink. His second-best pitch is a slider/cutter that's more notable for its upper-80s velocity than its bite. His curveball has good depth at times and his changeup has some sink and deception.When each of his pitches are at their best, PERSON has a plus-plus fastball and three solid-or-better secondary offerings. His delivery tends to get out of whack, so he has trouble throwing strikes and putting his pitches where he wants when he does find the zone. The ORGANIZATION are known for their ability to develop pitchers, so they still might turn him into a frontline starter, but an increasing numbers of scouts are pegging him as a reliever.",0
"PERSON took a step back in 2012 before rebounding in a big way in 2013. The big right-hander went 5-0 with a 1.81 ERA in 31 games between Double-A Birmingham and Triple-A Charlotte to earn a spot in GPE's bullpen, where he posted a 3.26 ERA in 19 1/3 innings. PERSON's fastball has been clocked as fast as 100 mph, but he more often sits in the low-90s. His arsenal of secondary pitches (changeup, slider, curveball) is average, and he has average command, so he may stay in the bullpen, where he can let his fastball loose.",0
"The ORGANIZATION surprised most of the industry when they chose PERSON eighth overall in the 2013 Draft, a move designed to save enough money to land PERSON with their next selection. But they also viewed PERSON as a quality prospect in his own right and signed him for $2.2 million. The only player ever drafted in the top five rounds out of PERSON, he has the tools to contribute offensively and defensively.The problem is that PERSON's right-handed stroke got out of whack when he started swinging for the fences when he reached Double-A in 2014. Making matters worse, he tinkered with his stance and stride and struggled to find a comfortable approach. If he can fix his swing, he still has the natural strength and leverage to hit 20 homers per season while hitting for a decent average.While PERSON won't be a stolen-base threat, he moves well for his size and has nearly average speed. A shortstop in college, he needs to cut down on his errors at third base but has the agility and arm strength to be an asset there.",0
"The D-backs have had their fair share of pitching prospects coming from the first round of the GPE, with PERSON and PERSON leading the way. They may have found another potential starter a bit later, nabbing PERSON in the 15th round of the 2015 GPE after he had a solid year as ORGANIZATION's Friday night starter.A PERSON All-Star during his first full season in 2016, PERSON earned a promotion to the GPE League in early July. With a three-pitch mix and an ability to throw strikes, he should be able to stay in a rotation long-term. The right-hander will touch 94 mph with his fastball, and he throws it with heavy sink, using his 6-foot-6 frame well. He mixes in a solid slider in the mid 80s and has a usable changeup as well. While he doesn't miss a ton of bats, he gets groundball outs and doesn't hurt himself with walks.PERSON's ceiling may be that of a back-end starter, one who is durable and can log innings. Finding that in the 15th round will certainly be a feather in the scouting department's cap if it all comes together.",0
" PERSON has a large, athletic frame and is already bigger than his cousin, PERSON. Listed at 6-foot-5, 215 pounds, PERSON is an imposing presence in the batter's box, but he moves well, having played basketball early in his high school career before focusing on baseball.  PERSON generates good bat speed and has solid power as a result. He shows some feel for hitting, though he remains raw at the plate.  PERSON plays shortstop in high school, but he spent a lot of time at third base on the showcase circuit. He will likely move there whether he signs with an ORGANIZATION organization or upholds his commitment to GPE. He earns praise for his makeup and effort on the diamond.",0
"PERSON GPE has an enviable track record of baseball success, producing a Hall of GPE (PERSON), 12 GPE 4-A state championships and 15 picks in the last 20 Drafts. The school's latest prospect is PERSON, the fastest runner in the 2015 Draft. Though his senior season came to an early end with a hamate bone fracture in early April, the injury shouldn't affect his Draft status.PERSON' top-of-the-line speed helps him beat out grounders for base hits, wreak havoc on the bases and cover plenty of ground in the field. More than just a slap hitter, the ORGANIZATION recruit shows bat speed from both sides of the plate and has gap power. He had one of the better batting practices at the workout before the Under PERSON All-America Game, hitting balls out of Illinois-Chicago's PERSON as a lefty and righty.While PERSON' quickness allows him to cover ground, scouts aren't sold that he has the arm for shortstop or the hands for the middle infield. He draws a lot of comparisons to PERSON, albeit with more strength, and could follow the ORGANIZATION' speedster's path from shortstop to center field.",0
"It hasn't been the easiest path for the big right-hander, but PERSON's spring as PERSON's Friday starter has put him squarely on the map as redshirt sophomore.PERSON pitched in relief at ORGANIZATION as a freshman, then left the school and attended PERSON, but didn't pitch. He's had problems with both knees and spent the year rehabbing. The work has paid off as he's thrown well for the ORGANIZATION, with a fastball up to 95 mph, a wipeout slider and a splitter he uses as his offspeed pitch. He goes right after hitters and is very aggressive on the mound.That bulldog mentality, when combined with his power stuff and his injury history, may have some looking at him in a short-relief role.",0
"PERSON was acquired from the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION deal and has loud tools, with all but the hit tool grading above average. The power may not play in games due to an indiscriminate approach, rather than poor bat control. That will be more palatable if PERSON can stay in center field, but the general consensus is that he's a right fielder. He's more of a low-end regular type in a corner.",0
" The ORGANIZATION teen is the top catcher in this year's class and appears to have all of the tools to make him an everyday Major Leaguer one day.PERSON is not a physically imposing figure, but the switch-hitting catcher has shown a strong arm and the ability to be a good receiver behind the plate. Scouts are certain he will improve in every area as he matures because of his good makeup and positive attitude.PERSON was the cleanup hitter for the ORGANIZATION 15-and-under team that won the gold medal last year in GPE and was eventually named to the all-tournament team. His raw power in batting practice and his ability to hit for power in games also separate him from his peers behind the plate. He makes solid contact from the right side of the plate and has a longer swing as a left-handed hitter. Scouts don't seem to mind that PERSON is not built to run.",0
"The ORGANIZATION regime purportedly considered PERSON for the 2015 draft's first pick, which seemed ill-advised given how risky both PERSON and his draft demographic were and are (raw, cold-weather prep outfielders can be PERSON or PERSON). He fell to pick 13. As a pro, PERSON has become a power and patience center field prospect. He owns a 12% career walk rate and in 2017 started tapping into power thanks to a swing change. He was a candidate for a 2018 national breakout, but got hurt during spring training and missed the entire season while recovering from labrum surgery. The injury ate an important year of PERSON's development, and also created risk that he has to move to left field if his arm strength doesn't return (he began throwing a baseball again in late-August). Just as he was starting to answer a lot of the pre-draft questions, a bunch of new ones were introduced, but we're still enamored with PERSON's physical gifts and upside. He'll likely begin 2019 at Hi-A.",0
"A 2013 international signee out of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON opened eyes the next year during his impressive professional debut in the ORGANIZATION. That success carried over into his first stateside action in 2015, when he slashed .344/.380/.469 in 45 games between the ORGANIZATION and GPE York-Penn Leagues. PERSON advanced to full-season ball for the first time in 2016, only to miss a portion of the first half with an ankle injury and appear in just 73 games.PERSON's quick hands from the left side of the plate fuel his game as a slap hitter who predominantly hits the ball on the ground and sprays it from line to line. He's also an adept bunter and gets out of the batter's box quickly, utilizing his above-average speed. PERSON will never offer much in the way of power, but he makes enough hard contact to accrue his share of doubles and triples.A raw defender when he signed, PERSON was one of GPE's more improved outfielders in 2016 after making strides with his routes and angles to the ball. He's capable of playing center field but profiles better in left, where his speed and average arm strength are cleaner fits.",0
"PERSON shot up ORGANIZATION boards in 2011 behind a dominant spring as PERSON's closer. He ultimately went to the GPE in the fourth round, signed for $400,000 and reached Double-A the following year in his first full season as a pro. But mechanical problems prevented PERSON from taking the next step, and he stalled out in the LOCATION over the next two seasons. In April 2015, the GPE traded PERSON to GPE for cash considerations in the amount of $1. After making endless tweaks and changes and failing to turn the corner during his years GPE, PERSON went back to throwing how he felt most comfortable. He saw immediate results and, as a result, quickly regained his confidence. The right-hander went on to have a breakout PERSON campaign between Double- and Triple-A, and the ORGANIZATION rewarded him with a callup in September.With the ORGANIZATION, PERSON used his 96-97 mph heater and a sharp, late-breaking slider in the low 80s to strike out 24 batters in 18 1/3 innings. He continued to pile up strikeouts to begin the 2016 season before landing on the disabled list in early May with rotator cuff tendinitis in his right shoulder.",0
"GPE of the same GPE recruiting class that featured future No. 3 overall pick PERSON (Rockies) and second-rounder PERSON (ORGANIZATION), PERSON redshirted in 2011 and pitched just 13 innings for the ORGANIZATION in 2012. He transferred to PERSON, an ORGANIZATION II program, and signed for $100,000 as a 13th-rounder in 2013. His pro career didn't begin to take off until 2015, when he earned swift promotions from low Class A to high Class A and from reliever to starter.Coming out of the bullpen, PERSON worked with a 95-97 mph fastball that reached triple digits and flashed a wipeout slider. His stuff hasn't been quite as overpowering since he moved to the rotation, but he has been effective nonetheless. He has shown the makings of a decent changeup and continued to fill the strike zone in his new role.PERSON still may be better suited to be a reliever because he's more dominating in shorter stints and there are questions about whether his big body is conditioned well enough to handle a starter's workload over a full season. Even if he does move back to the bullpen, the extra innings this year will help make up for the fact that he worked just 56 frames in 2014, when he missed a month with shoulder issues.",0
" PERSON's stock has risen all spring as scouts have been impressed with his natural hitting ability. He has an easy, loose swing and uses his quick hands and natural strength to drive the ball. He squares the ball up well and hits plenty of line drives. PERSON is an average runner, which may eventually force him to move off of center field, but his athleticism and improving feel for the game help make him a solid defender. PERSON missed his sophomore year with a torn labrum in his non-throwing shoulder, but the injury has not impacted him since. He turned 19 in March and will be a Draft-eligible sophomore if he upholds his commitment to PERSON.",0
"In a system filled with raw, toolsy position players, PERSON stands out for his polish at the plate. After signing for a well-over-slot $800,000 as a third-rounder in 2014, he batted .300/.404/.356 with nearly as many walks (74) as strikeouts (76) in his first two pro seasons.PERSON is an advanced hitter for his age, recognizing pitches and controlling the strike zone better than most and producing line drives to all fields. He barrels balls easily and has a quick right-handed bat, so he might reach double digits in home runs once he gets stronger. He has average speed that plays well on the bases but won't result in many steals.Though PERSON saw more action at second base in his pro debut and third base the last two years because PERSON has so much shortstop depth, the ORGANIZATION believe he can play short. While his range is average, he has good instincts, reliable hands and a solid, accurate arm. PERSON tried him as a catcher during instructional league and may give him more exposure behind the plate.",0
"In last year's GPE, a toolsy high school hitter from GPE with professional bloodlines was taken in the second round. That was PERSON, whose father PERSON played in the ORGANIZATION and who worked with cousin PERSON to hone his craft. This year there's another son of a pro in the region in PERSON, who has the potential to go in the same neck of the woods in the GPE, and whose father currently manages the Triple-A PERSON in the ORGANIZATION' system.PERSON has all the tools and athleticism one would want to see from a high school performer. There's raw power from both sides of the plate and while it's more of a line drive swing from the left side in games, he shows the pop in batting practice regularly with plus raw power overall. He's also a plus runner with basestealing ability, though he was slowed a bit with a hamstring injury earlier this spring. The only question about him on the offensive side is the swing and miss to his game, with some wondering about him making enough contact to tap into that raw pop.The PERSON commit has played infield in high school, but there is consensus that he'll move to the outfield at the next level, and he did play out there over the summer. He has the tools to play a strong center field and the bloodlines, not to mention a familial coach, to maximize his potential.",0
"There isn't a lot of college hitting in this year's PERSON class, and the college catching crop is particularly thin. But GPE's ability with the bat, coming from a strong GPE program, has him poised for early-round consideration.GPE has long impressed with the bat. His 10 home runs as a sophomore, while playing in a pitching-friendly home park, led the ORGANIZATION as they won the ORGANIZATION World Series. He has an advanced approach at the plate and solid power, especially on the extra-base front, though he should have some over-the-fence pop at the next level. He's continued to be very consistent at the plate as a junior, though there are many questions about his ability to stay behind it as a pro. His catching skills are quite raw, with a fringy arm and rough receiving skills.Teams might want to send GPE out as a catcher; those that do might consider him in the opening round. But his bat alone -- and he has played first base at times -- should make him a day one selection.",1
"An effective three-year college starting pitcher at GPE taken in the fifth round of the 2015 Draft, PERSON found his home in the ORGANIZATION system as a reliever and racked up 64 saves in his first three years. But in 2018 at ORGANIZATION, he was employed mainly in a set-up role, pitching well enough to earn a spot on the 40-man roster.PERSON has an often deceptive three-quarters delivery that enables him to hide the ball well. Able to throw up to 97 mph, he can also keep hitters guessing by changing arm angles and tempo or shortening his stride. Unless he develops his below-average and seldom-used changeup, he could have time managing left-handed hitters in the big leagues. He could temper that with by burying a backdoor slider in on lefties.While he certainly has the mentality to be a big-league closer with a delivery not unlike PERSON or PERSON, his stuff projects as a likely better fit as a middle reliever or right-handed matchup specialist. PERSON doesn't walk a lot of batters nor he is victimized much by the long ball, and he is capable of racking up strikeouts.",0
"PERSON raised his profile with a strong summer turn with ORGANIZATION. He's continued to show enough with the bat to make him the kind of college performer who typically does well once the ORGANIZATION rolls around.The Tennessee outfielder has always shown a good amount of bat speed, but in the past it's typically generated more line drives than loft, more extra-base gap power than over-the-fence pop. While PERSON does swing and miss a bit, he was walking at a higher rate in 2015 and more than doubled his career home run total over his first two years with the ORGANIZATION. A fringy runner with an average at best arm, PERSON likely would profile best in left field defensively.A team that thinks PERSON can tap into his bat speed and strength and provide more consistent power will take him early as a potential every day corner outfielder.",0
"PERSON bounced around to three different colleges as an amateur and after a solid junior season pitching in relief at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, the ORGANIZATION made him their seventh-round pick in 2015. Given a chance to start, the big right-hander had reached Triple-A and was just about knocking on the big league door when he needed PERSON surgery. He did return at the very end of the summer in 2018 and participated in instructional league play, then shook off the rust to pitch his way back to Triple-A in 2019 and got called up to GPE for the first time in GPE, though he didn't appear in a game during his first stint in the big leagues.PERSON pitches at 93-94 mph as a starter but showed the ability to get 97-98 mph on occasion, and could pitch there consistently in shorter stints should the ORGANIZATION ever put him back in the bullpen. He does have two distinct breaking balls, and he'll go back and forth depending on which one he has a better feel for. It might behoove him to focus on one, with the slider the leading candidate, if he returns to relieving. His changeup does give him an option against left-handed hitters.Now healthy, PERSON is once again ready to impact the big league staff. He could serve as a back end starter, but it might be exciting to see how his already-good stuff plays up as a short reliever.",0
"  PERSON was one of the top two-way players in the college ranks leading up to the 2014 First-Year Player Draft. In addition to playing right field and hitting in the middle of the order for PERSON, he also pitched out of the Titans bullpen. PERSON' fastball got up to the mid 90s, and he saved seven games for PERSON in 2014. But thanks to his powerufl bat, professional scouts liked him more as a hitter. He controls the strike zone well and could hit for a solid average to go with his pop. After playing several positions during his college career, PERSON has settled at third base as a professional. He's made progress at his new position and has already shown that he could move quickly in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"A late-round pick of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON was released after two uneventful summers in GPE's system. Tigers scout PERSON convinced him to go to an open tryout in GPE, which led to a spot as a backup outfielder in the ORGANIZATION. An injury opened a starting spot for him and he ended up winning league ORGANIZATION honors. PERSON was far from done, jumping all the way to Double-A while continuing to perform. While he's 25 years old, he's still a little green in terms of experience as he continues to figure things out. His well above-average speed is his carrying tool and he thinks he's capable of stealing 70 bases a year once he learns the nuances of the craft. He can really go get the ball in center field and while his arm is fringy, it's accurate. He doesn't always look pretty at the plate, but he makes contact and knows his job is to get on base.With a brother who played in the ORGANIZATION and another who played pro basketball in GPE, PERSON clearly comes by his athleticism honestly. That, and his unwillingness to give up on his dream, could get him to the big leagues.",0
"One of several bargains signed by PERSON assistant GM for international operations PERSON and his staff, PERSON turned pro for a $25,000 bonus out of the ORGANIZATION in 2010. He pitched in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON at age 20 and made his big league debut in a relief role last September at age 22.PERSON has one of the best changeups in the Minors, and its combination of deception and sink earns plus-plus grades from some evaluators. He sets it up with a running fastball that usually operates at 92-95 mph and climbs as high as 98 in short stints. His curveball used to be a weakness but he has added depth to it and it's usually an average pitch.Similar to PERSON at the same stage of their careers, PERSON has a ceiling of a mid-rotation starter and a good chance to become at least a late-inning reliever. To stay in the rotation, he'll need to resist the temptation to overthrow his fastball (which causes it to straighten out) and to fall in love with his changeup (which leads him to drop his arm slot and turn his curve into a slurve). He also needs to refine his ability to control and command his pitches, which has diminished as he has risen through the Minors.",1
"A very strong spring had this GPE prep right-hander climbing up ORGANIZATION boards. The LOCATION commit has one of the most electric arms coming from the mid-Atlantic region in recent memory. Though he factored in the top two rounds, he asked teams in mid-May to not draft him because he wants to attend college.Just 17, PERSON can flat-out bring it, cranking the fastball up to 100 mph and hitting the mid 90s with regularity. He can maintain velocity into starts as well, combining the fastball with a low- to mid-80s slider that flashes plus. He shows a little feel for a changeup but doesn't use it in games. There's some effort in his delivery, which leads to some inconsistent command, and the question will be whether he can tone down the delivery to improve his control.The other question is about his size, as PERSON fits the mold of the ""undersized right-hander."" But with a strong and thick body, there shouldn't be concerns about durability.",0
"Entering the 2011 season, the ORGANIZATION had the game's consensus top two catching prospects in GPE PERSON and PERSON. PERSON never put a lot of effort into catching, and his career has fizzled since he got traded to the ORGANIZATION, and some evaluators wonder if PERSON might be headed down the same path. He continues to post solid but not spectacular offensive numbers, but his work ethic and maturity are concerns.PERSON still shows the impressive tools that earned him a $3 million bonus in 2009. He generates huge raw power with bat speed, strength and loft in his right-handed swing, and his throwing arm is well above average. He can lapse into an all-or-nothing approach at the plate at times, but he has enough offensive upside to profile as an everyday player if he has to move to first base.If he can stay behind the plate, PERSON could be an All-Star. He has no problems throwing out basestealers, but his blocking and receiving need a lot of work. He topped Double-A PERSON catchers with 17 errors and 10 passed balls in 2014, often looking indifferent about his defense.",1
" One look at PERSON, a 6-foot-6 right-hander, and you think ""durable starting pitcher."" His inconsistencies on the mound, however, make some wonder if that's ultimately his best role, though he did make his big league debut as a starter in 2015.PERSON did shake off a slow start in his first taste of Triple-A in 2014 to finish the season well, but it left some question marks. PERSON's fastball has enough velocity, sitting in the low 90s and touching more than that at times. He throws it with good downward angle and sink when he's on, though he's up in the zone more than he should be. His changeup is his best secondary offering, with his slider coming in a close third. Both have the chance to be PERSON average, but again, he struggles to throw them consistently well. PERSON doesn't hurt himself with walks, but his command within the strike zone has hurt him. He'll continue to get work as a starter, but his fastball might play better in short relief, long-term.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in 2011, PERSON hit .231 in his pro debut before batting .315 or better in each of the next four seasons. He's one of the best hitters in the ORGANIZATION' system and is continuing to hit for a high average in Double-A this year, though he's still searching for a position. He broke into pro ball as a catcher, moved to third base in 2015, shifted to second base this year and also has seen action at first base and left field.PERSON's bat earned him a spot on PERSON's 40-man roster last November and was his ticket to the big leagues this July. He's a switch-hitter with a knack for squaring up fastballs from both sides of the plate. Beyond producing lofty batting averages, he has the pure hitting ability, solid bat speed and strength to create average power.PERSON doesn't contribute a whole lot outside the batter's box, however. He has enough arm strength to play a variety of positions, but his lack of speed and quickness makes him best suited for the infield corners or catcher. He has been erratic at the hot corner and offers the most intrigue as a catcher, where he threw out 45 percent of basestealers in the lower Minors.",0
"A draft eligible sophomore whose frame remains projectable, PERSON will run his fastball up to 97 but he lacks a clear bat-missing secondary. Some scouts project heavily on his cutter/slider and curveball because we are talking about a sophomore and one who spent much of his freshman year in the ORGANIZATION bullpen where his reps were limited.",0
"  PERSON was one of the youngest players in the 2013 Draft class, and he also had some of the best power. His relative youth hasn't been apparent in the ORGANIZATION, as he has held his own at every level. Now it will be up to the ORGANIZATION to further develop him after acquiring him in the trade that sent PERSON to the D-backs.PERSON packs a lot of power in his big, physical frame. His approach at the plate is still a work in progress, however, limiting how much of that pop he can use in games. At his best, PERSON uses the whole field to hit, and with more experience, he should be able to drive the ball out of any part of the park. PERSON was a shortstop in high school, but he was quickly moved to the outfield by the D-backs. He has the tools to become an adequate outfielder once he gets used to the new position.",1
"After the PERSON signed PERSON away from a scholarship to the ORGANIZATION of GPE, they sent the GPE high schooler out as a shortstop. His fringe average arm meant a move to second made sense and that's almost exclusively where he's played for the past two years. He's still learning that side of the infield, but should be an average defender when all is said and done. He's a slightly above-average runner who is better underway and he's shown the skills to be a solid contact hitter from the left side of the plate. He could be a decent offensive-minded second baseman or, at the very least, a valuable utilityman best suited for second, but who could help out at shortstop and third if needed.",0
"PERSON dominated as a full-time reliever in GPE Cod last summer, sharing the league lead with eight saves while not surrendering an earned run in 13 appearances. Though he's one of college baseball hardest-throwing starters, he hasn't had nearly the same success during three years at ORGANIZATION. His fastball velocity and performance in college baseball's top summer league could still get him drafted in the first five rounds, however.PERSON has been clocked as high as 98 mph and can carry a 93-95 mph fastball deep into games, with good downhill plane and some armside run. His changeup can be a plus pitch at times, featuring deceptive arm speed as well as fade. He flashed an improved slider on the GPE last summer but lacks feel to spin and has pitched with a below-average breaking ball for much of 2018.While PERSON generates premium starter velocity without much effort, hitters see the ball well against him and don't miss his fastball as much as would be expected. His control and command lack consistency, which also makes him vulnerable. The consensus is that he's best suited for a relief role as a pro, and he could have a plus-plus heater in shorter stints.",0
"PERSON sat out all of 2016 after transferring to PERSON & Mary from GPE, where he had appeared in just 12 games out of the bullpen as a freshman. The redshirt sophomore pitched to mixed results in his first season with The Griffin but showed enough arm strength and stuff to warrant a third-round selection by the ORGANIZATION. A physically strong and durable left-hander, PERSON operates in the low-to-mid 90s with his fastball and can reach back for 96 mph, all while maintaining his velocity deep into games. His changeup is his best secondary offering, one that receives above-average grades from scouts, and he also features a pair of average breaking balls in a curveball and a slider. After missing plenty of bats but struggling to throw strikes as an amateur, PERSON pitched to opposite results during his pro debut. Learning to repeat his delivery as well as harnessing his stuff and throwing more strikes would bode well for his chances of remaining a starter, although there's little doubt among scouts that PERSON could move quickly in a bullpen role.",0
"Looking at his stuff without all the context that encompasses 'mound presence,' PERSON is a three-pitch middle-relief prospect. His fastball typically sits in the low 90s and his slider is solid average, perhaps a tick above. But PERSON is a gargantuan 6-foot-7, takes a large stride toward the plate, and releases the ball much closer to home than the average pitcher, creating a ORGANIZATION Fister-like effect that allows his stuff to play up. He has a 1.16 career ERA in pro ball and has K'd more than a batter per inning. Like most XXL pitchers in their early 20s, PERSON struggles with control, but hittersâ inability to adjust to his delivery in short stints has limited their overall ability to reach base. As a result, he has a 1.05 career ORGANIZATION despite an 12% career walk rate. Itâs hard to say how this rare type of deception will play in the big leagues, assuming upper-level hitters are still flummoxed by it as PERSON moves on. PERSON was dominant for a half decade with a similar type of deception but he had much better stuff.",0
"Though PERSON hit 94 mph with his fastball and backed it up with an interesting slider in high school, he wanted to play every day and the ORGANIZATION granted his wish after signing him for $914,600 as a second-rounder in 2014. He has moved quickly, beginning 2017 by batting .357 in the World Baseball Classic for GPE and ending it in GPE, where he hit his first big league homer off PERSON. In between, he batted .314 as the youngest regular (age 21) in the Triple-A PERSON, where he was just one of two regulars with more walks (52) than strikeouts (50).One of the best pure hitting prospects in baseball, PERSON recognizes pitches and controls the strike zone better than most players his age. He uses the whole field, repeatedly barreling balls with a quick left-handed stroke geared for line drives. Though he homered just seven times in 132 games last season, his hitting ability, bat speed and strength should translate into average power if he adds some loft to his swing.As good as he is in the batter's box, PERSON's best tool actually is his plus-plus arm. Despite average speed, he has spent much of his pro career in center field, where his instincts help him get the job done. Scouts are split on whether he can handle center on a daily basis in the Majors, but no one doubts that his arm would play in right.",1
"A strong showing as a Pittsburgh junior in 2016 pushed PERSON into the first round of the GPE, where the ORGANIZATION selected the big right-hander with the ORGANIZATION. 21 overall pick. A back injury limited PERSON somewhat during his first full season, but he still jumped on the big league radar by pitching well at ORGANIZATION A Advanced ORGANIZATION and then boosted his stock even more against better competition in the ORGANIZATION. Returning to the ORGANIZATION State League in 2018, PERSON made just six starts at ORGANIZATION before moving up to Double-A New Hampshire. He was an LOCATION All-Star at midseason, and continued to pitch well down the stretch while leading the ORGANIZATION to an LOCATION title. An imposing presence on the mound at 6-foot-7, PERSON uses his height to his advantage by creating a steep angle to the plate. The downhill plane only enhances the right-hander's sinker, a plus pitch he throws with heavy late life in the low- to mid-90s. This enables him to generate ground balls at a near-elite rate (57 percent in '18). PERSON's curveball has become his best secondary offering and plays nicely off his sinker, keeping hitters off-balance with its shape and late bite. His slider wasn't as sharp in 2018 but is still viewed as an average pitch, and he also throws a changeup that's a distant fourth pitch. Despite his size, PERSON's long levers are consistently in-sync, and he repeats his delivery well. It allows him to pound the zone with his entire arsenal. PERSON assuaged concerns about his durability last season by accruing more than 156 innings, or more than double the workload from his first full season. The only drawback to PERSON's profile is that he doesn't miss many bats and therefore doesn't rack up strikeouts. Instead, he mostly pitches to contact, consistently attacking the bottom of the zone early in the count to force weak contact. Altogether, PERSON has the look of a future backend starter at the highest level, perhaps more if he can improve his breaking balls and start to generate more whiffs.",0
"Drafted as the most advanced college bat in the 2010 Draft class, PERSON quickly got to Triple-A with the Cardinals in his second full season, though most felt he took a step back from a productive first year. He has continued to scuffle in the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION since the PERSON got him at the 2012 PERSON for PERSON. He still has some of the hitting tools that made him a first-round pick apparent, with a short, quick stroke and the ability to spray line drives to all fields. PERSON shows some pull power, but perhaps tried too hard to muscle up in 2012 and got away from his game plan. There is some question what his defensive home will be, with a strong enough arm for third but fringy defensive tools otherwise.http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mia/bernie-pleskoff-miami-marlins-third-base-prospect-zack-cox-remains-a-mystery?ymd=20131006&content_id=62601086&vkey=news_mia",0

Big, strong and durable, he throws his fastball, curve, slider and changeup around the plate consistently and varies his arm slot to give hitters different looks.A team that takes PERSON can give him the chance to remain as a starter, knowing that he had success as a lower-angle lefty reliever in the past.",0
"Originally a member of the 2014 graduating class, PERSON chose to speed up the process and graduated a year early before becoming the ORGANIZATION' second Draft pick in June. PERSON played shortstop in high school but will almost certainly move to a corner, where his below-average speed and 6-foot-4, 200-pound frame profile better, and left-handed hitting third basemen are always valued highly. PERSON has shown some ability to hit, and his strength allows him to hit for power as well. If he can't handle the hot corner -- though that's where he played during his pro debut -- he could give a corner outfield spot a try.",0

"Both PERSON's father and brother played college baseball, but it looks like PERSON is going to be the first in the family to extend his playing career to the professional ranks.After a strong summer in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON has kept hitting for PERSON. His plate discipline and pitch recognition are as good as any college hitter in this Draft class. He's more of a line-drive hitter right now, but there is some slugging potential in his left-handed swing, plus excellent bat speed and good balance at the plate. PERSON is very versatile as a defender. He's more of a corner outfielder, but he can even play center field in a pinch, and he can even play first. PERSON's home park is not hitting-friendly, and many Cavaliers hitters have gone on to hit better at the next level. The team that thinks that will happen for PERSON, and that more power will come, will take a long look in the top few rounds.",0
"Two-sport athletes are supposed to be slow to develop, since they don't focus on one sport as amateurs. The ORGANIZATION have been pleasantly surprised by how quickly PERSON's game has advanced, as he backed up a solid first full season with a strong 2014 in the ORGANIZATION State League at age 20.A former running back in high school, PERSON is as athletic as they come, with tools aplenty. He has excellent bat speed and makes consistent hard contact to all fields. He doesn't have a ton of over-the-fence power, but he hits the gaps consistently. He doesn't strike out much, but he needs to walk more if he wants to be a more complete top-of-the-order catalyst. PERSON has above-average speed. That, and his aggressive style of play, makes him a dangerous baserunner. His speed plays well in center field, as does his solid throwing arm.PERSON has come a long way in a short time. The ORGANIZATION are excited that he might just be scratching the surface of his enormous potential.",0
"GPE throws hard for his age, sitting in the low-90s and bumping up against 95. He's short but not small and sturdily built, quelling concerns about his durability but propagating ones about his fastball's projection. He garners swings and misses with the curveball and GPE's changeup has significant projection because his arm action is so efficient. Like many GPE prospects, GPE's cultural influence is apparent in GPE's efficient and consistent delivery.",0
"At 6-foot-1, 180, PERSON would look out of place in a team photo of big league first basemen, full of big-bodied mashers and explosive rotational athletes. He lacks prototypical first base pop but there's a non-zero chance he makes enough contact to balance the offensive scales sufficiently to profile as a platoon 1B/LF or low-end regular. His 2018 post-draft showing in the ORGANIZATION was impressive from a bat-to-ball standpoint and he took great at-bats and made hard contact during instructional league, though that was all against pitching comparable to what he saw in college. He's a sleeper bat we like but it's a tough profile, one he'll have to hit his way to.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION scouted PERSON at FACILITY A&M, they thought his stuff as a reliever could have placed him in the top two rounds of the 2016 Draft. But he struggled in his junior year, so he was still on the board when the ORGANIZATION picked in the fifth round that June. His power stuff has played well in the lower levels of the Minors, and he was a ORGANIZATION State PERSON All-Star in 2018.With big stuff that projects well for the ORGANIZATION as a reliever, PERSON has two effective pitches with a plus-plus 94-98 mph fastball and an above-average power curveball that ranges from 87-90 mph. There is no question he has swing-and-miss stuff, with a 12.3 K/9 ratio entering 2019. He also gets a lot of weak contact on the ground, as evidenced by his 1.60 GO/AO ratio through the 2018 season.PERSON still has work to do to sharpen his command and control after he had 4.9 walks-per-nine innings last season at ORGANIZATION while he posted a 1.76 ERA in 44 games. He doesn't need to have pinpoint control in short relief, but more consistent strikes could lead to him getting high-leverage innings late in games.",0
"The term ""projectable right-hander"" gets tossed around quite a bit around GPE time, and Canning fits the description quite well.The ORGANIZATION product and ORGANIZATION commit already has an interesting three-pitch mix that he's not afraid to use. His fastball will touch the low 90s with some good sink when he keeps it down in the zone. He has a good feel for his changeup, and his slider has a good late break when his mechanics are right. With a frame that seems ideal for adding strength and good weight, there could be a lot more in the tank, velocity-wise, all coming from a clean and easy delivery.Canning might not profile as one of the top prep arms in the GPE class, but the team that dreams on what he might become is the one that will take him in the top five rounds.",1
"PERSON starred for three seasons at ORGANIZATION, going 30-9 with 403 strikeouts (second-most in school history) and appearing in two College World Series. His velocity decreased during his junior year in 2017 and caused him to drop toward the end of the first round, and he signed for a slightly below-slot $1,925,000 after a post-Draft physical raised concerns about his back. His stuff stayed down in his first full pro season but has rebounded somewhat in 2019 and had advanced to Double-A when the ORGANIZATION sent him, along with PERSON, to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION Deadline.PERSON had one of the best curveballs in the 2017 Draft, and while it's still often his best pitch, it's not quite the low-80s hammer he had at ORGANIZATION. His fastball is back up to 91-95 mph after ranging from 88-92 mph in 2018, though he never has commanded his heater particularly well. He improved his fading changeup when he had to use it more often out of necessity, and he also has picked up a cutter.Even when PERSON was thriving in college, scouts questioned the effort in his delivery and some projected him as a reliever. He may never have more than average control or command, a problem for a pitcher without much margin for error. His competitiveness allows him to get the most out of his ability, though he has looked like a back-of-the-rotation starter early in his pro career.",0

But he has shown significant improvement in the last year and has prototypical right-field tools. He'll attend GPE if he doesn't turn pro.",0
"Though PERSON only threw in the low 80s in high school, PERSON still valued him as a recruit because he was a projectable left-hander with a competitive streak. After pitching in middle relief as a freshman, he emerged as the ORGANIZATION' best starter the last two seasons. His 119 strikeouts as a junior matched PERSON's single-season record (PERSON, 1970) and also ranked 17th among all ORGANIZATION Division I hurlers. That knack for missing bats earned PERSON a selection in the fourth round by GPE, and he signed for pick value at $245,600.PERSON's standout pitch is a changeup that arrives in the low 80s and drops off the table as it approaches at the plate. While he has gotten stronger, he won't overpower hitters with a fastball that tops out at 93 mph but usually settles in at 88-90. It plays above its velocity, however, because he commands it well and his funky delivery leads to some awkward swings.Though his mechanics are unorthodox, PERSON repeats them well and doesn't have any problem finding the strike zone. His biggest need is to improve his fringy slider, and he's committed to using it so he'll have a true three-pitch mix.

For two long weekends in GPE he did everything. He crushed balls in all parts of the strike zone, ran plus-plus times to first base, and made several highlight reel defensive plays at second base. The wrist fracture kept him out for the rest of February, all of March, and most of April. When he returned, PERSON kept hitting, but not for power, which is consistent with what plagues hitters for several months after they've had a break in the hand/wrist area. 
That trend continued through his first pro summer, which was interrupted by a hamstring issue, as PERSON struggled to pull and/or lift the ball at all. He had a downward, slashing swing instead of the dynamic and athletic cut he'd had early in the year, when he could scoop and lift stuff at the bottom of the zone. But he kept making contact. It was a month before a pro pitcher was able to strike PERSON, who only K'd in 3% of his pro plate appearances last year, out. 
It's fair to make a distinction between prospects who are small, and ones who are just short. PERSON is short, but is built like a little tank. PERSON is small, a diminutive 5-foot-7, 165 pounds, and this, combined with his total lack of post-draft power, has the pro side of scouting very concerned. He looked tired and sluggish during instructional league, though it wasn't as if he'd played a whole year and was an obvious candidate to be run down, furthering concerns that his size will be an issue. We're inclined to believe there's a substantial bounce-back on the horizon. He was the best draft-eligible hitter we saw last year, a complete player with few, if any, flaws.",0
"GPE isn't the sexiest prep arm, as he doesn't throw particularly hard or have lots of physical projection, but he has a bit of both and, more importantly, advanced feel for a three pitch mix to go with a clean arm action.",1
"Signed for $115,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2012, PERSON spent his first three seasons in pro ball in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION. He hasn't had much statistical success since coming to the GPE in 2016 and led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with 12 losses in his full-season debut last year. Nevertheless, he has one of the better ceilings among Royals pitching prospects.PERSON has a quick arm that generates 93-97 mph fastballs and uses his 6-foot-3 frame to throw downhill, getting more than his share of swings and misses as well as groundballs. His curveball gives him a second plus pitch at times, though it's not as consistent as his heater. He needs to improve his changeup and employ it more because left-handers have pounded him on a regular basis.Though PERSON has impressive stuff, he's still figuring out how to use it. He gets hit harder than he should because he doesn't command his pitches well, and his control regressed at the start of the 2018 season. If he can't realize his potential as a starter, he has the tools to make an impact as a reliever.",0
"PERSON has done nothing but rake since his selection in the second round of the 2013 Draft. He hit .371 during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, posted a .340 clip as a 19-year-old old to win the LOCATION batting in his full-season debut, and hit over .300 again in the ORGANIZATION in 2015 before a late-season promotion to Double-A Bowie. It was more of the same last season in PERSON's return to the LOCATION, as he paced the circuit in on-base percentage (.406) and finished fourth in batting (.320) en route to a late Triple-A promotion and the ORGANIZATION' PERSON of the Year award. Back in the ORGANIZATION in 2017, PERSON continued to showcase his plus hitting ability and earned a trip to the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON for a second straight year.PERSON's feel for hitting has long belied his age. He makes a lot of quality contact with a level left-handed stroke and never tries to do too much, letting the ball travel deep so as to utilize the whole field, while also showing a very impressive approach and plate discipline. PERSON profiles as a gap hitter but showed more over-the-fence pop in 2016, and he's produced similar power numbers in his first full Triple-A campaign. Improvements in PERSON's blocking, receiving and game-calling last season have helped to assuage some concerns about his defensive profile. PERSON now project him to be average behind the plate, though his fringy arm and catch-and-throw skills limit his impact on the running game. The ORGANIZATION signed free-agent catcher PERSON to a one-year deal during the offseason, in part to allow PERSON additional time to develop, as he represents the club's next long-term option behind the plate.",1
"Long known to area scouts in LOCATION for his multiple tools, PERSON jumped onto bigger radar screens with a strong performance in this year's PERSON. He's not a slam-dunk early-round choice, as some don't necessarily see him translating those tools into consistent production, but he's shown enough to warrant some top six round consideration.PERSON's best now tool is his speed and he's been recorded with 4.1-second times out of the left-handed batter's box to first base this spring. That speed should allow him to be a threat on the bases as well as cover a ground in the outfield. He has some skills at the plate and makes hard contact when he stays behind the ball. There is a ton of raw power which shows up in GPE, but not yet consistently in games. With enough arm and instincts, he has the chance to stay in center long-term, unless he fills out his 6-foot-5 frame too much, in which case he could fit a corner outfield profile from a power perspective just fine.While opinions of PERSON varied, there are some who feel he's the type of player who could exceed projections. A LOCATION commit, some see an PERSON body type, with production to potentially follow.Prospect ORGANIZATION - PERSON, GPE.",0
"PERSON has progressed steadily through the system after signing out of GPE for $775,000 in 2008. Even with his development slowed by a high ankle sprain this year, he's on the verge of reaching the ORGANIZATION. Yet it remains to be seen whether PERSON will be an everyday player or a fourth outfielder.An extremely patient hitter, PERSON diligently works counts and uses the entire field. Scouts believe he can be too passive at times, however, and would like to see him try to drive balls more often. PERSON needs to get stronger, as well, or else he might be pegged as more of a tweener than a regular.PERSON' speed, arm and defensive ability are all fine, but he presently lacks the power to fit on an outfield corner or the quickness to start in center. While his skills are best suited for left field, he's capable of playing all three spots.",1
"The ORGANIZATION thought they were getting a bat-first backstop when they took GPE as a Draft-eligible sophomore out of GPE in the ORGANIZATION B in 2016. A solid first full season that saw him play across two levels of A ball has further cemented that evaluation. After reaching Double-A for the first time, the ORGANIZATION dealt him with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION Deadline.GPE showed, at least during his time with GPE in the LOCATION, that his power will play. That's particularly true from the left side of the plate, where his pop is at least average, but he has 45 power from the right side as well. There is some swing and miss, but he's also willing to be selective in waiting for a pitch to drive. The ORGANIZATION hadn't worked much with launch angle previously, but they are shifting some focus in that direction and that should help GPE, who has always been about lifting the ball. His defense remains behind the bat and while he has a long way to go, he's made progress and worked hard behind the plate. He'll never wow anyone back there, but there is confidence he'll be capable enough to stay there. That gives him the chance to be a switch-hitting, offensive-minded big league regular catcher with power. What team wouldn't want that kind of player?",0
"  There might be other young pitchers with more pure stuff, even those who were taken along with PERSON out of high school by the ORGANIZATION. But this lefty -- sent to the ORGANIZATION in the blockbuster deal that gave ORGANIZATION, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON -- has more polish than many pitchers of his age. Thatâs not to say he doesnât have good stuff. PERSONâs fastball will sit in the 89-91 mph range, and he throws it with good deception and movement. His curve has good three-quarters break to it when he throws it correctly, and his changeup can be a plus pitch. PERSON can throw them all for strikes even if thereâs a little cross-fire to his delivery. His feel for pitching could allow him to start moving faster.",1
"Though PERSON was the hardest thrower in their system, he was so raw that the ORGANIZATION declined to protect him on their 40-man roster after the 2014 season. The ORGANIZATION picked him in the Rule 5 Draft and immediately sold him to the GPE, who couldn't keep him and lost him on waivers to the ORGANIZATION. Returned to GPE right before the start of last season, he skipped a level to Double-A and had his most consistent year as a pro to earn a spot on the 40-man this time around.PERSON has a lightning-fast arm that has regularly produced upper-90s fastballs since he became a full-time reliever toward the end of 2014. He can reach 102 mph with his heater, though it gets straight toward the upper limits of its velocity. He pairs his fastball with a slider than can creep into the low 90s and runs the gamut between a wipeout pitch and a below-average slurve.PERSON has the pure stuff to become a closer but still has a lot of work to do to reach his ceiling. He has spotty control and command, in part because he falls in love with radar-gun readings, overthrows and has trouble repeating his mechanics. He also allowed more hits than he had strikeouts in his first two years in full-season ball, which may be a sign that he lacks deception.",1
"PERSON helped lead ORGANIZATION to the GPE state 7-A championship and a No. 2 national ranking in 2013, but he worried clubs, didn't put up big numbers and was committed to PERSON. He dropped to the 30th round but wound up signing for $440,000, the equivalent of fourth-round money. Since then, he has established himself as one of the better young hitters in the system.PERSON has an advanced approach at the plate, displaying patience and a penchant for using the opposite field. His hand-eye coordination allows him to make consistent hard contact, and he has the bat speed and strength for average power if he lets his swing loose and turns on more pitches. Compared to other Red Sox first-base prospects, he can't match the pure hitting ability of PERSON or the raw power of PERSON Ockimey.After playing mostly on the outfield corners in 2014, PERSON saw the majority of his action at first base last season. He shows good hands and footwork at first, though he moves well enough despite below-average speed that the outfield is still a possibility. He has the arm strength for right field, having shown a low-90s fastball when he was a two-way player at ORGANIZATION.",0
"Though it seems like PERSON was more inclined to nibble with his fringy fastball in the hitter's paradise of the ORGANIZATION, he was still pretty successful and of interest to teams ahead of the trade deadline. His fastball plays because he hides the ball well, it has some life at the top of the zone, and he works it up around the hands of righties, causing significant discomfort. His command enables his milquetoast breaking ball to play, but his dastardly changeup, which PERSON uses against hitters of both handedness, is clearly his best pitch. The deception may not play multiple times through a batting order if PERSON ends up in a traditional starting role. Instead we think he fits best in a role like PERSON, who has similar stuff.",0
"Three-pitch lefties with mid-90s heat always have a shot, so while PERSON's walk rate remains a disconcerting 13%, the fact that he showed 96 with an occasionally good changeup and breaking ball means he's still pretty interesting. His arm action is so long that it needs to be split into two movies and while that is probably part of why he so badly struggles to throw strikes, it also makes him really tough on left-handed hitters. The existence of three pitches (the fastball, an upper-80s change, low-80s slurve) better positions PERSON for the three-batter minimum rule, but he still needs to throw more strikes or he's just upper-level depth.",1
"PERSON was regarded by most scouts as the toolsiest player in the 2014 Draft, but concerns about his hitting ability caused him fall into the second round, where the ORGANIZATION signed him for $1.3 million as the 51st overall pick. Though he hit .310 and led the Rookie-level PERSON with 66 hits in his pro debut, the LOCATION native struggled with the move to full-season ball in 2015, hitting just .231 with a ORGANIZATION-leading 162 strikeouts at ORGANIZATION A ORGANIZATION. PERSON fared much better in his return to ORGANIZATION in 2016, however, earning mid-season All-Star honors in the ORGANIZATION before moving up to ORGANIZATION A Advanced Lake Elsinore in late June. PERSON' bat speed, foot speed, arm strength and defensive ability all grade as well above average. He's an outstanding defender in center field, where he gets great jumps, uses his double-plus speed to cover a ton of ground and shows a ridiculously strong arm. PERSON' swing is just as explosive and gives him plus raw power, but he's been unable to make consistent contact as a pro, let alone apply it consistently in games. Meanwhile, strikeouts will continue to be a problem for the young outfielder until he improves his pitch recognition and strike-zone management.PERSON' frustration showed at times last season, but the ORGANIZATION felt he did a good job separating his defense from his struggles at the plate. His tools and athleticism give him the ceiling of a star-caliber player, and he could develop into an everyday player with a modicum of improvement at the plate.",0
"GPE is built like a human sports car, chiseled and squared-shouldered. He runs like one, too, and may be a plus defender in center field at peak. He has crude feel for slasher-style contact right now and the way his style of and quality of contact develop will dictate what kind of role he's capable of playing. Right now he swings and hits like a tweener, but he's so young that his physical abilities, which are loud, matter much more at this stage. He's a talented, long-term developmental piece.
",0
"The ORGANIZATION liked PERSON enough to give him a $250,000 bonus as a 17th-rounder in 2012, but after he posted a 6.44 ERA in his first three pro seasons, they gave him to the FACILITY for two months of PERSON. He started to make progress during his year in GPE's system, then really blossomed in 2016 following a trade to the Rockies in exchange for PERSON. PERSON led GPE farmhands with 156 strikeouts in 168 1/3 innings and pitched well in five late-season starts in Double-A.Drafted as a projectable right-hander who topped out at 92 mph in high school, PERSON has gained 25 pounds since turning pro and now sits at 93-96 mph and reaches 98 with some sink on his fastball. His mid-80s slider is harder than it is sharp but can be a plus pitch at times. He'll also flash an average changeup, though it lacks consistency.PERSON has a durable build, throws strikes and keeps the ball down in the zone. He has all the ingredients to fit in the middle of the rotation and shouldn't require much more development time. If for some reason he doesn't make it as a starter, he could be a high-leverage reliever whose stuff shows even more power in shorter stints.",1
"PERSON was deployed all over the diamond to begin his professional career, seeing time at every position save for pitcher and catcher. He took over at shortstop full time at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Carolina in 2013, after he was passed by PERSON on the organizational ladder. He reached Triple-A for the first time in 2015 and continued to build on that success in his return to GPE this season before making his big league debut in July. PERSON has into his own offensively in the past two years, demonstrating a better feel to hit as well as improved bat-to-ball skills. He generates sneaky power through physical strength and bat speed, though his barrel path is more conducive to hitting ground balls and line drives than home runs. Once a free swinger, PERSON has cut down on the whiffs in 2016, though he's also drawing few walks. An above-average runner, PERSON is still learning how to utilize his slightly above-average speed on the basepaths. His wheels also stand out at shortstop, where he shows impressive range and athletic actions as well as a rocket arm. PERSON's overall game needs more consistency, but he has the necessary tools to become a quality big league middle infielder.",0
" The GPE high school product has the kind of size and raw skill set scouts like, even if it might take a little while for him to develop. Big and strong, PERSON will show flashes with his bat and should grow into more power as he matures and gains a better knowledge of the strike zone. He was a shortstop in high school, and thatâs where he played in the Rookie-level PERSON during his summer debut. Many feel, however, that with his size, a move to third will be necessary in the future. He should have the defensive tools necessary to be a good third baseman, and if it comes together as the D-backs think it will, his bat would profile well there, too.",0
"PERSON was the second-youngest player in the LOCATION League in 2013, playing much of the season as a 17-year-old. He more than held his own against the older competition, and he continued playing well ahead of the curve in the ORGANIZATION in '14.The son of former All-Star PERSON, PERSON has a good feel for hitting from both sides of the plate. He is an above-average runner, and while PERSON doesn't hit for much power now, scouts expect that to change as he matures. Defensively, PERSON has a strong arm and good infield actions. He is a good bet to stay at shortstop, and he has the potential to be an above-average defender.PERSON's youth and inexperience are understandably exposed at times, but he is already very advanced for his age.",1
"Undrafted and unheralded out of high school, PERSON blossomed into one of the top hitters in college baseball and the highest pick ever from GPE. Ranked as the top position prospect in the ORGANIZATION in each of his two summers in college, he went ninth overall in the 2015 Draft and signed for $3 million.A switch-hitter who's better as a lefty, PERSON exhibits good balance and controls the strike zone well. With plus bat speed from both sides of the plate and some deceptive strength, he should hit for both average and power. He's a solid runner with some basestealing aptitude.PERSON possesses athleticism and has a strong arm, and his value will be even higher if he can play up the middle. He broke into pro ball as a center fielder, though many scouts believe he fits best on an outfield corner. He played mostly second base in 2013 but lacks smooth infield actions.",1
" An unheralded 24th-round pick out of LOCATION in 2013, PERSON signed for $35,000 and recorded a 6.96 ERA in his pro debut before making a name for himself in his second pro season. He was named pitcher of the year in the Rookie-level PERSON, which he topped in strikeouts (77) and strikeouts per nine innings (12.8). He upped his whiff rate to 16.7 in four starts at low Class A Great Lakes, where he fanned 14 in one game to break PERSON's single-game franchise record.PERSON threw in the low 90s at LOCATION and boosted his fastball into the mid-90s once he improved his delivery and conditioning in pro ball. He also improved his slider, which now operates in the low 80s with depth and gives him a legitimate swing-and-miss pitch.PERSON is willing to throw his changeup and does a reasonable job of throwing strikes. He projects as a starter but it remains to be seen how his stuff will hold up over an entire year in full-season ball. At worst, his fastball and slider should make him a useful reliever.",1
"GPE dominated as a ORGANIZATION high school senior in 2013, going 11-0 and pitching an 11-strikeout one-hitter in the state 4-A championship game, but he went undrafted because he was a finesse left-hander with a strong commitment to PERSON. He stepped right into a weekend-rotation role with the ORGANIZATION as a freshman and has served as a reliable starter for three seasons, winning the clinching games of ORGANIZATION regionals and super-regionals to send ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION World Series in 2015.GPE hasn't added much velocity in three years of college and operated with a fringy 89-91 mph fastball that will hit 93 on occasion and features some run and sink. He does have a pair of weapons in his curveball and changeup, both of which are solid and show flashes of becoming plus offerings. He can run his curve into the upper 70s with 11-to-5 break and keep right-handers at bay with his sinking changeup.Though there's some effort in GPE's delivery and his control has slipped a notch this spring, he usually locates his pitches where he wants. That's important to his future success because he has no projection left in his stocky 6-foot-1 frame and little margin for error. That said, he's a higher-floor prospect with the moxie to be a back-of-the-rotation option and the curveball to be a situational lefty if starting doesn't work out.",0
"A highly regarded recruit who got just four innings as a GPE freshman in 2016, GPE opened eyes by starring in the ORGANIZATION that summer. His success prompted him to transfer to the ORGANIZATION JC of GPE, Manatee-Sarasota, which made him Draft-eligible as a 2017 sophomore. He ranked second among national juco pitchers with 133 strikeouts before the ORGANIZATION selected him 27th overall and signed him for $2.2 million.GPE's best pitch is his 12-to-6 curveball, a low-80s hammer when he stays on top of it. His fastball is close behind, ranging from 91-96 mph with impressive movement and downhill plane. He rarely used his changeup as an amateur, so GPE had him focus on it during his introduction to pro ball, which partially explains his 9.21 ERA in his debut.The ORGANIZATION see considerable promise in GPE's changeup and see him developing into a starter with three quality pitches. He does feature effort in his delivery and has trouble keeping his mechanics in sync, a problem that cropped up again in his first summer as a pro. If he winds up in the bullpen, he has closer upside.",0
"PERSON burst onto the prospect scene in 2015, hitting 10 homers in 48 games in the ORGANIZATION at age 17. He signed as a shortstop but has moved down the defensive spectrum to right field, retaining his loose, lefty swing and physical projection. In the interim, PERSON has had maturity and consistency issues, which he appears to be moving past now. Longer-limbed power hitters typically take the longest to develop offensively, making his pro debut that much more surprising. He'll be 21 years old next year, with a chance to get to Double-A and regain the everyday player projection some saw in 2015.",0
"The ORGANIZATION selected PERSON in the fourth round of the 2015 GPE, making him the highest-drafted player to come out of GPE. The top ORGANIZATION II prospect in his GPE class, he signed for $484,000, made his pro debut at ORGANIZATION A Short-Season Tri-City and then earned All-Star honors while finishing sixth in the batting race (.320) at ORGANIZATION A Fort Wayne in first full season. He made even greater strides at the plate with PERSON in 2017, especially in the power department.A left-handed hitter with bat speed and strength, PERSON is an offensive-minded backstop who knows how to drive the ball and projects to hit for power and some average. He has a knack for making contact and does a good job controlling the strike zone, in turn limiting his swing-and-miss at the plate.PERSON's large frame raises questions among evaluators about whether he can stay behind the plate long term. He has decent hands and some raw arm strength, but his receiving skills are below average and he needs to improve his catch-and-throw skills after throwing out just 20 percent of attempted basestealers in 2016.",0
"PERSON's high price tag as a Draft-eligible sophomore in 2017 scared away many teams, and he ultimately turned down the ORGANIZATION as a 29th-round pick to return to PERSON. As a junior, PERSON once again ranked among the LOCATION's premier starters and helped lead the ORGANIZATION to a runner-up finish in the 2018 College World Series. The GPE, after selecting PERSON in the third round in June, went $436,800 above slot to sign the right-hander for $1.1 million.PERSON may be extremely skinny, listed at 6-foot-3 and 165 pounds, but he has some power to his fastball, which sits at 90-94 mph and peaks at 97. He also has a mid-80s slider that has a high spin rate and qualifies as a plus pitch at its best. He also will mix in an effective changeup and a curveball he can throw for strikes. PERSON has a quick arm and generates velocity without much effort in a repeatable delivery that allows him to fill the strike zone.PERSON's stuff stands to improve in the professional ranks if he can add weight to his wiry frame. It also would help answer questions about his durability, especially after PERSON held him out of summer ball for two straight years and limited him in fall practice as a junior. It's a mid-rotation profile if all comes together for PERSON, though he's likely to be brought along slowly given the relevant concerns about his durability.",0
"There's nothing subtle about PERSON. As a freshman, he earned the nickname ""PERSON"" because of his constant energy and his full-out sprints from the bullpen to the mound. He takes the same approach on the mound, aggressively attacking hitters, and it resulted in school record for saves this spring at ORGANIZATION' stuff has kicked up a notch in his junior season. After pitching with an 88-92 mph fastball last year, he's now operating at 90-95. He also throws a tough upper-80s cutter that he can turn into a mid-80s slider with more break when he wants.PERSON also has a curveball that shows signs of turning into an average offering, though he uses it infrequently and mostly just to give batters a different look. He's not big, but he has a solid build and sound mechanics. He repeats his delivery well, enabling him to throw strikes and keep the ball down in the zone.",0
"One of 20 players in baseball history taken in the first round of two GPE, PERSON went 21st overall to the ORGANIZATION in 2011 and 14th overall three years later, when he helped ORGANIZATION win the 2014 College World Series. Signed for $2,613,200, he led the Double-A PERSON with a 2.81 ERA in 2016, then got knocked around in Triple-A last year before a groin injury truncated his season in mid-July. He made his big league debut with a pair of starts this April, but pitched so poorly after returning to Triple-A that the ORGANIZATION shifted him to the bullpen in June to simplify things.PERSON's fastball velocity has fluctuated, in part depending on his usage of sinking two-seamers and harder four-seamers. He spent much of 2017 working at 90-93 mph after spending the previous year at 92-94 mph with a high of 97. The quality of his curveball and cutter vary as well, leaving his fading changeup as his best and most consistent secondary offering.PERSON's control has slipped this year and his command is even less reliable, leaving him more hittable than he should be. Some club officials believe he'd be best served by simplifying his pitch mix and attacking hitters with his four-seamer, a true slider and his changeup. Reducing his arsenal could make it easier to refine his pitches and realize his upside as a mid-rotation starter.",0
"After PERSON came out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE and dominated both in his pro debut and in the ORGANIZATION in 2014, he looked poised to get to GPE in a hurry. His trip was delayed when he scuffled with a move to Double-A in 2015, though he righted the ship with a bounce-back 2016 season that saw him reach Triple-A for the first time. However, his progress was slowed by a shoulder strain that forced him out for the first two months of the 2017 season.With renewed confidence and a more streamlined delivery that was consistently online, PERSON had better results. His velocity ticked upward, sitting consistently in the 94-96 mph range and thrown with good movement to get ground-ball outs. His slider also improved and he continues to refine it. He actually has shown glimpses of a decent changeup, but he doesn't use it enough. His command got better, thanks to his online delivery. He can still get under the ball at times with too much of a low-3/4 slot, which impacts both his command and the quality of his pitches.Hard-throwing right-handed relievers are becoming a depth position for the ORGANIZATION farm system and PERSON once again looks like he belongs in the group that will help out in GPE soon.",0
"PERSON has the quintessential rags-to-riches story. He was released by the Phillies in 2009, picked up by the ORGANIZATION after a long layoff from affiliated baseball in 2013, then pitched his way from A ball to the big leagues in 2014. PERSON was a starting pitcher when he first joined the ORGANIZATION organization, making 12 starts in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League. The ORGANIZATION moved the left-hander to the bullpen and sent him, at age 25, to the LOCATION. He went from GPE to GPE and up to GPE before becoming a surprising September callup. Along the way, he struck out 14 batters per nine innings in the Minors while not walking a ton of batters, using a fastball in the 90-93 mph range and a plus slider that's absolutely killer on left-handed hitters. PERSON is likely never going to be more than a lefty specialist, but those who can establish themselves in that job can pitch for a very long time.",0
"In an age when radar gun readings often rule the day, GPE stood out on the summer showcase circuit more with his feel for pitching than plus velocity. He threw 12 shutout innings for the 18U GPE National Team, and there was a reason he got the ball for their gold medal game against GPE, won by GPE thanks to his six scoreless frames.There are better fastballs among the deep high school pitching crop in this GPE class, but GPE's pitchability is what separates him. That's not to say he doesn't have good stuff, because he has the potential to eventually develop three pitches that could garner a 60 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. He'll throw his fastball in the 89-94 mph range, maintaining the velocity throughout his starts, and he opened some eyes by touching 96-97 mph frequently in the early stages of the spring. He's also made mechanical changes to vastly improve his command of the pitch. He throws a slower curveball with three-quarters tilt and good spin rate and introduced a new, and very effective, slider this spring. And his changeup gives him a third secondary pitch that could be plus when all is said and done.The top left-hander in the GPE class, GPE has thrown well enough this spring to cement himself as a potential top 10 pick in June.",0
"Born in GPE, PERSON attended high school in GPE. His elbow blew out when he was a senior, just as he was experiencing an uptick in velocity. WHen he returned, so did his mid-90s fastball. PERSON was traded as part of a package for several good A's relievers. He's advanced from a stuff and pitchability standpoint, enabling him to succeed at Double-A already at age 20. He's a potential mid-rotatino starter.",0
"PERSON may not be quite as advanced as the other top high school pitching prospects in the 2015 Draft, but he may deliver quality velocity as easily as any of them. He works at 90-92 mph and tops out at 96 while looking like he's just playing catch. He could sit in the mid-90s once he fills out his 6-foot-4 frame and gets more consistent. While his curveball and changeup have a ways to go, PERSON has some power and depth to his breaking ball and some fade and deception to his changeup. His athleticism and lack of effort in his delivery bode well for his ability to throw strikes.He's part of the same ORGANIZATION Community program that spawned PERSON, who went on to GPE PERSON and became the 13th overall pick in the 2014 Draft. PERSON has committed to PERSON.",0
" GPE was the ORGANIZATION' top prize in the 2012 international signing class. They've given him challenging assignments, and he was among the youngest everyday players in his league in each of his first two professional seasons. GPE has a short, compact body that is well suited to a career behind the plate. He has a quick release and strong arm, and he will shut down the running game as he gains more experience. He's making strides with the finer points of catching, including game calling. While defense is the strongest part of GPE's game, he has the tools to develop offensively, as well. The potential to be a top-notch all-around catcher is there, but he will be just 19 for all of the 2015 season and remains a long way from a finished product.",0
" Some international prospects come to the GPE and are, at least initially, overwhelmed. Not so for PERSON, who made his GPE debut in 2012 and was among the ORGANIZATION leaders in a host of offensive categories. He continued his strong play in Class A LOCATION in 2013 until being traded to the ORGANIZATION in August as a part of the deal that sent PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION. While PERSON isn't the biggest guy in the world, he's shown he can really hit and projects to be an above-average hitter in the future, with more power than you'd expect from a guy his size. A well-above-average runner, the GPE infielder should be able steal bases consistently, and that speed should also help him with his range as he continues to improve at second base.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"UC PERSON had a pair of pitchers from its staff get drafted in the top five rounds in 2015, with PERSON going No. 4 overall and PERSON landing in the fifth. While you typically ""Never Say Never"" in the GPE, it's unlikely PERSON will land in GPE territory, but the three-year starter should hear his name called before PERSON did.Right now, PERSON is the epitome of the advanced, yet not exciting, college arm. A Sunday starter a year ago, the right-hander has served as ORGANIZATION's Friday night guy after a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION last summer. He doesn't have a true out pitch, using three average offerings effectively. He generally pitches around 90-91 mph, but there could be some more velocity to unlock at the next level. He mixes in a solid slider and changeup and pounds the strike zone with all three pitches.A lack of a true out pitch limits PERSON's ceiling, but his polish and track record will interest many teams. The fact he could move quickly and teams won't have to ""PERSON"" him should also work in his favor.",1
"Just like his older brother PERSON, PERSON was a college reliever at ORGANIZATION who repeatedly touched triple digits with his fastball. They played together in 2014, when the PERSON made PERSON a second-rounder, before PERSON succeeded him as closer and became a first-round pick last June. Signed for $2,128,500 as the 26th overall choice, he reached Triple-A in his pro debut and returned there in 2017 before an ulnar collateral ligament tear in his elbow ended his season in July.PERSON's fastball ranges from 95-100 mph in most outings and has reached 102, featuring armside run at its best but also straightening out at times. His slider can creep into the low 90s and has good depth, and some evaluators hang double-plus grades on it. He also flashes a plus changeup with sink, which can make hitters look silly when they're trying to catch up to his heat.Though PERSON's three quality pitches and relatively clean delivery led some teams to toy with the idea of making him a starter, the FACILITY Sox see him as a future closer. He was the favorite to be the first player from the 2016 Draft to reach the big leagues before his injury, which likely will require PERSON surgery. When he returns, he just needs to get more consistent with his control and command, which sometimes go awry when he gets offline to the plate.",0
"PERSON ORGANIZATION's usage of PERSON suggests they may be developing him with a multi-inning role in mind, as 17 of his 26 appearances in 2018 were of the multi-inning variety. PERSON though, he looks like a two-pitch, single-inning reliever, though potentially a very good one, as he'll flash the occasional 70-grade curveball. A well below average athlete and strike-thrower, there's skepticism that PERSON will improve his command deficiencies, but his stuff is very good. He struggled with a late-season promotion to Hi-A and should return there in 2019. He could move quickly if the command suddenly clicks, but we don't think it will.",0
"PERSON began his post-high school career on the junior college circuit, at ORGANIZATION State College in GPE. He transferred to PERSON and pitched in relief as a junior, albeit not with good results. The ORGANIZATION liked his stuff enough to take a flier on him in the 30th round of the 2017 Draft. After being sent out as a reliever during his pro debut, PERSON got a chance to start and ran with it, pitching his way across three levels and finishing the year in Double-A.PERSON relies heavily on a fastball-splitter-changeup trio to get hitters out. He'll throw his fastball in the low-90s with occasional life. His split-finger changeup is his out pitch, and it's a good one, thrown in the low-80s with tumble that can miss bats and get weak contact. He mixes in a breaking ball as well and has shown the ability to throw strikes, with all three pitches coming from a quick and repeatable delivery.In all likelihood, PERSON ends up back in the bullpen, where his fastball-split combination could play up. His success as a starter has opened some eyes, and at the very least, he has shown he could be a multi-inning reliever.",0
"PERSON was one of the best college athletes available in the 2015 Draft, and a strong Cape Cod League performance had him poised to go in the top two rounds. But he never really lived up to his tools in three years at ORGANIZATION, so the ORGANIZATION were able to grab him in the sixth round and sign him for $248,800.PERSON's best attribute is his plus-plus speed, though he's still learning to get the most out of it. With his wheels, he should be a more prolific and successful basestealer. He also should be capable of playing center field, though he has spent most of his college and pro career in right, where his strong arm is an asset.There's a lot going on with PERSON's left-handed swing, and he can struggle with breaking balls, which holds him back at the plate. He has the bat speed and strength to hit for power, and he drives the ball during batting practice, but he has yet to display much pop in games. Though he has an eye for drawing walks, he gets too passive at times and strikes out too often.",0
"After starring on a pitching staff that included five future high school first-rounders and won a gold medal at the 18-and-under World Cup in GPE in September 2015, PERSON had first-round aspirations of his own. But an inconsistent prep senior season and worries about his mechanics rendered him unsignable, so he headed to GPE after turning down the ORGANIZATION as a 38th-rounder in the 2016 Draft. Now a similar scenario is unfolding this year, when PERSON has followed a banner summer in the ORGANIZATION with an up-and-down spring and may not get picked high enough as a Draft-eligible sophomore to turn pro.PERSON can show flashes of three plus pitches but doesn't produce that kind of stuff on a regular basis. He often worked with a mid-90s fastball on the GPE, but he sat in the low 90s this spring, and his heater is hittable because it lacks much life. His best secondary offering is a mid-80s changeup with fade, though he lacks feel to spin and doesn't trust his curveball.The biggest issue with PERSON is his delivery, which is long in back and short in front. It affects the quality and command of his pitches and also allows hitters to get a good look at them. The hope is that he can clean things up and maybe become a mid-rotation starter, but the consensus is that he'll be a reliever who will have to work heavily off his fastball.",0
"After breaking out in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in 2014, PERSON made even greater strides last year during his full-season debut, earning Mid-Season All-Star recognition in the Class A ORGANIZATION at age 20 before moving up to Class A Advanced Stockton in late July. Starting at shortstop for the Ports in the absence of the injured PERSON, PERSON hit .320/.372/.480 while serving as the team's three-hole hitter in 35 of 39 games. The A's viewed him as candidate to begin 2016 in Double-A, only to have PERSON arrive at Spring Training already dinged up after an offseason motorcycle accident. As a result, PERSON got a late start on his pre-season strength and conditioning, and it wasn't until late April that he finally received an assignment to GPE. PERSON is an excellent athlete whose tools are among the best in the A's system. His explosive right-handed swing yields hard contact from line to line, and there's enough physical projection remaining to forecast at least average power in his future. He already shows good feel for finding the barrel and works to drive the ball back up the middle, though, like many young hitters, he does deviate from his approach at times. PERSON has the tools to stick at shortstop, with above-average speed and quick feet that give him good lateral range to go with his plus arm, although inconsistent footwork and a lack of body control have resulted in high error totals to begin his career. He needs refining, but PERSON has considerable upside as an everyday shortstop capable of impacting games on both sides of the ball.",1
"PERSON checked a lot of amateur scouting boxes -- the body, athleticism, stuff, and makeup were all lauded -- and was a model-friendly prospect due to his age, so while issues with fastball command caused some clubs to project him in relief, he was still a clear top two round talent. Perhaps PERSON' control is behind because, as a cold-weather amateur prospect, he hasn't pitched all that much. He only threw around 40 innings during his senior spring, and bad suburban high school hitters in GPE couldn't catch his fastball. As a result, PERSON had little cause to use his changeup during varsity play -- some national evaluators would go whole starts without seeing it -- but it flashed 55 or 60 during his showcase summer and was easy to dream on. 
Perhaps the most striking aspect of PERSON' post-draft performance was how regularly he located his slider down and to his glove side. He has mid-rotation components if you're willing to dream and based on his athleticism, age, and geographic background, we are.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 21, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON is not only a baseball prospect, but the all-around athlete is also a dynamic, versatile football player. The ORGANIZATION A&M commit was labeled as a three-star football recruit on multiple recruiting services and rushed for over 4,000 yards in three years on the varsity level.Instead of continuing his football career, PERSON has opted to focus all his intentions on the diamond. He profiles as a catcher with intriguing potential pop at the plate.",0
"The compensation pick the ORGANIZATION received for losing PERSON to free agency, PERSON signed for $1.9 million as the 30th overall pick in 2013. He went deep in his first pro at-bat and led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with 25 homers as a 19-year-old in his first full season, but his encore was disappointing. PERSON hit five homers in two months in the ORGANIZATION before drawing an 80-game suspension after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance. While challenging for the ORGANIZATION home run lead in 2016, he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION in return for PERSON and PERSON has much more power than the typical second baseman, generating it with bat speed and backspin from the right side of the plate. He shows some ability to draw the walks and use the whole field, but he's too aggressive at the plate. PERSON struck out in 35 percent of his plate appearances over his first three pro seasons, in large part because he's still figuring out how to deal with breaking pitches.A shortstop in high school, PERSON has a strong arm and average speed that many scouts thought would fit best at third base. With PERSON and PERSON at third base, the ORGANIZATION moved him to second base in 2014. PERSON had adapted well to his new position and should become at least an average defender there. Now without those obstacles, but the possibility of PERSON playing second for a long time, the ORGANIZATION might consider giving PERSON a look at the hot corner.",0
"A catcher during his amateur days in GPE, PERSON has made the move to the outfield, with the chance to be a power-hitting corner guy in the future.PERSON brings a ton of natural strength to the plate, which should allow him to continue to hit for power. With excellent bat speed, he should be able to hit for average as well. Too big to stay behind the plate, PERSON moved PERSON to left field during his summer debut in the Rookie-level PERSON, and that's where he'll stay for the time being. O'Neil will need to work on his defensive play. A move to first isn't out of the question, but in the end, it's his bat that will carry him up the organizational ladder.The adage goes that if you can hit, you'll find your way to the big leagues. The ORGANIZATION hope that is the case with PERSON as well.",1
"Though PERSON didn't begin pitching until he was a junior at ORGANIZATION (Ill.) High, his arm strength quickly became apparent as he reached 94 mph as a senior in 2009 and 98 mph after transferring from GPE to GPE (GPE) JC in 2010. Ultimately signed for $50,000 as a 16th-round pick out of GPE in 2012, he struggled to harness his live arm in this first three pro seasons before cleaning up his delivery last year. Following his breakout performance in high Class A, the ORGANIZATION protected him on their 40-man roster, only to learn in March that he needed PERSON surgery that would cost him the entire 2016 season.PERSON is a reliever who aggressively goes after hitters with two pitches. His fastball now sits in the mid-90s and can climb into triple digits, featuring riding life to go with its plus-plus velocity. His late-breaking slider resides in the mid-80s and can be a wipeout pitch, though it still can get slurvy at times.PERSON has started to realize that he doesn't have to try to blow out the radar gun on every pitch, a habit that causes him to overthrow, drop his arm slot and get under his pitches. His mechanics still aren't pretty but he's taking a more direct path to home plate and finding the strike zone. He issued just 2.5 walks per nine innings in 2015, down from an average of 7.6 in his first three years as a pro.",0
"PERSON's blend of bat speed and bat control has long made him a prospect of note, and at times he's looked like a future high-contact, multi-positional role player. But at age 24, PERSON's willingness to swing at most of what he sees is still a problem impacting his ability to reach base, as well as the quality of his contact. He struggles to lay off of breaking balls, he ends up topping pitches into the ground, and the bat control alone may not be sufficient to keep PERSON afloat at second or third. But you also can't teach this kind of feel for contact, and perhaps a swing change that moves the game power is still a possibility, though the arrow is clearly pointing down.",1
"PERSON displayed an interesting array of tools when he won the 9/10-year-old division of the GPE, PERSON & Run competition at the 2005 All-Star Game in GPE, and he's continuing to do so since turning pro as a third-round pick in 2016. In his first full pro season, he led the Minors with 113 runs while ranking fourth with 51 steals and fifth with 12 triples. In his second, he became the fifth PERSON shortstop to reach this big leagues this millennium, following PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON's well above-average speed is his standout tool and he employs it well. After hitting too many routine fly-balls in college, he has adjusted his approach to put more balls on the ground and use his feet to get on base, where he had 87 steals in 105 attempts during his first two seasons. He has a quick right-handed swing and barrels the ball consistently, and while he doesn't offer much power, he does show good patience at the plate.After spending his pro debut at shortstop, PERSON split time between second base and short in 2017. While his actions, range, hands and internal clock work at both spots, his average arm is a better fit at second. He shows ORGANIZATION upside at second base as he continues to learn the position.",1
"One of several potential steals the FACILITY found in the 2013 Draft, ORGANIZATION surprisingly slipped to the fourth round amid projections that he could go in the supplemental first. Scouts are split on whether he's a future starter or reliever, though in the latter role, he would have the upside of a closer.ORGANIZATION had the best curveball among college pitchers in last year's Draft. It's a power breaker that reaches the low 80s, and it can vary between unhittable and uncontrollable. Hitters can't just look for ORGANIZATION's curve, because he has a 90-94 mph fastball that has soared as high as 98 when he has come out of the bullpen.For ORGANIZATION to remain in the rotation, he'll have to significantly upgrade his changeup and command. He throws from a low three-quarters angle that makes it difficult for batters to see his pitches and for him to harness them.",0
"PERSON started the ORGANIZATION all-star game in 2014, highlighting a summer in which he positioned himself as a likely first-round candidate for the 2015 Draft. He struggled early that spring before rallying late in the season and going in the second round to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON broke down over concerns about his elbow, so he returned to GPE for his senior season, during which he started slowly but finished strong once again.PERSON's stuff has looked pretty much the same as it did a year ago. He has one of the better fastballs among college starters, working at 92-95 mph and hitting 98. He generates easy velocity with a 6-foot-7, 245-pound frame that also creates difficult angle and plane on his pitches.His slurvy breaking ball has been a little less sharp this spring, though PERSON shows a solid low-80s slider when he stays on top of the pitch. He rarely employs his changeup but has shown some decent feel for it in the past. He throws enough strikes and has a ceiling of a workhorse starter, though some scouts think his inconsistent command means he'll have more success as a high-leverage reliever.",0
"H.B. PERSON in GPE has churned out more than its fair share of GPE talent, none more famous than ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION. More recently, it produced outfielder PERSON, who went No. 5 in the 2015 GPE to the ORGANIZATION and is one of the top prospects in baseball. PERSON gets some comps to his former Plant outfield mate, albeit with less power and more speed.PERSON does have the makings of a five-tool player. Currently, his standout tool is his speed, which he uses to get down the line in a hurry and run down balls in center field. He has really good hands to hit and some feel the 6-foot-4 left-handed hitter will add power once he starts incorporating his lower half more consistently. He can defend in the outfield to go along with a plus arm.Committed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE, PERSON does have a backup plan on the mound, with a fastball up to 93 mph and a decent curve from the left side. But his tools on both sides of the ball as an outfielder should have him in play in the early going, and he was firmly in first-round conversations despite missing time with a hamstring injury.",0
"A quintessential changeup/command righty, GPE carved up Double-A hitters with surgical precision and ended his 2018 with a 25% strikeout rate and 5% walk rate in 152 innings. Big leaguers with similar peripherals and similarly below-average velocity include PERSON (whom GPE mimics, mechanically), PERSON, and PERSON. There's precedent for success in spite of poor velocity, and several of those case studies tout changeups and fastball command, but many of them also involve a deeper repertoire than GPE has, which is rounded out by a pedestrian curveball. Without something else, GPE projects as more of a No. 4 or 5 starter than he does a mid-rotation arm. He's only 22, so there's a chance that happens. There's also a chance his changeup and command become elite and he mimics PERSON' career very closely.",0
"PERSON flashed a low-90s fastball as an GPE high schooler in 2016, but he went undrafted because he battled injuries during his senior year and was strongly committed to GPE. He missed all of his first year with the ORGANIZATION following PERSON surgery, and worked just 24 2/3 innings during the regular season this spring. But that has been enough to attract scouts, because he has hit 98 mph as a rare Draft-eligible redshirt freshman.PERSON has worked at 95-98 mph in short stints, generating velocity without much effort. He'll occasionally throw some sharp mid-80s sliders, but for the most part his breaking ball has been below average. He has used his changeup so infrequently that it's best described as a work in progress.Though he has thrown strikes, PERSON has been hit harder than expected for someone with a mid-90s fastball. He needs to improve his command and his secondary pitches to keep batters off his heater. He's far from a finished product and his signability is uncertain, but his fastball alone makes him intriguing.",0
"PERSON wasn't a hyped international prospect and it's easy to see why. As a 5-foot-11, 170 pound righty, he would need to have electric stuff to be a real prospect, stuff he didn't have when he signed for $50,000 in the 2017 class. This year, that stuff materialized with a mid-90s fastball and plus-flashing curveball, along with a changeup that shows average at times. The future scouting grades add up to a potential mid-rotation starter, but PERSON is still just 19, with no full-season minor league experience, a frame that likely isn't conducive to starter bulk innings, and a ways to go to even reach those projected future grades. With a realistic outcome of multi-inning power reliever, PERSON joins a number of power arms the ORGANIZATION have been developing at a greater than usual rate.",0
"The D-backs took PERSON with their first selection in the 2013 Draft, then took PERSON out of ORGANIZATION next. The college duo pitched in the same rotation at several levels, though it was PERSON who reached Double-A first in 2014, then got promoted to Triple-A first in 2015. He was shipped to the ORGANIZATION, along with 2015 No. 1 pick PERSON, in the blockbuster PERSON deal at the 2015 Winter Meetings.PERSON's above-average fastball will touch at least 95 mph, sitting in the low 90s, with good running movement. He has very good feel for a mid-80s changeup and his curveball has improved and could be better than PERSON average when all is said and done. Scouts like how quickly PERSON works and he goes right after hitters. As effective as PERSON was at missing bats in 2014, he also didn't hurt himself with walks.PERSON shouldn't need too much more seasoning in the ORGANIZATION and could be called upon to help out the big league rotation in the near future. He could develop into a very solid and durable middle-of-the-rotation type starter.",1
"Few players in the 2018 college PERSON class can match PERSON's track record with wood bats. He led the ORGANIZATION with a .406 batting average in the summer of 2016 and was PERSON's most productive hitter last summer. His pure hitting ability gives him a chance to become the first GPE position player selected in the first round since PERSON in 1982.Thanks to his hand-eye coordination, pitch recognition and controlled approach, PERSON repeatedly laces line drives to all fields. He's not big but he has a quick left-handed swing and some deceptive strength that should produce at least average power. Though he makes contact so easily, he continues to hone his plate discipline and draws his share of walks.PERSON's bat is his lone above-average tool and will have to carry him. While he uses his savvy to get the job done in center and right field for the ORGANIZATION, his average speed and fringy arm likely will push him to left field in pro ball. Scouts do love his instincts and makeup.",0
"GPE proved to be a legitimate two-way prospect during his three years at the ORGANIZATION of PERSON. He batted .338 and ranked among the ORGANIZATION' leaders in most offensive categories as a junior, and he also started six games on the mound to go along with his usual duties as closer. His talents were on full display during the 2015 Big Ten Tournament, when he hit .389 and saved four games to capture ORGANIZATION honors, and he's repeatedly surpassed expectations since being drafted in the seventh round by PERSON has done nothing but hit as a professional. He's long been able to hit for average thanks to a clean, fluid stroke from the left side of the plate, and scouts believe his current gap power could develop into some over-the-fence pop. In addition to his innate feel to hit, GPE employs an advanced approach, knows how to manage the strike zone and demonstrates strong on-base skills, with a knack for making contact and coaxing walks. His speed is slightly above average but plays up on the basepaths thanks to his strong instincts and ability to reach pitchers.After playing a host of positions for PERSON, GPE split time between second base and shortstop during his pro debut before moving to shortstop full time in 2016. His athleticism and quickness translate to sufficient range, and he's worked hard this season to improve his footwork. His plus arm, meanwhile, which helped him set a ORGANIZATION school record with 27 saves, is a good fit on the left side of the infied.",0
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $350,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in April 2013, but he didn't make his pro debut until June 2014 because he drew a 50-game suspension after testing positive for an anabolic steroid. He spent his first two seasons as a starter before becoming a full-time reliever in 2016, when he reached PERSON and opened some eyes by hitting 100 mph with his fastball.PERSON's stuff took a step forward when he moved to the bullpen. His fastball, which sat around 90 mph when he signed and 92-94 mph when he started, worked at 94-97 with some sinking and running action when he relieved. His slider surged as well, sitting in the mid 80s with sharper bite than in the past.PERSON also has a changeup that's fringy at best, but he doesn't really need it in his new role. While he made some progress with his control and command, both require further refinement. He's a long way from the big leagues, but his fastball will afford him plenty of time to get there.",1
"PERSON nearly won the ORGANIZATION triple crown in both his sophomore and junior seasons, putting up better numbers in 2015 than he did in 2014, landing him firmly in first-round conversations. The PERSON pounced on his advanced skills at the plate with the ORGANIZATION. 22 pick in the GPE, signing him for pick value.PERSON has often been compared to PERSON, both for his hitting ability and concerns about his lack of athleticism and less than ideal body. PERSON does make consistent hard contact from the right side of the plate with plenty of bat speed. He backspins the ball consistently, which gives him 20-homer potential in the big leagues. His plate discipline is outstanding, and he should be a big on-base percentage guy in the future. As a closer at FACILITY, PERSON touched 94 mph, so his arm works fine from third, but most foresee a move to first base in the future given his below-average speed.The PERSON did send PERSON out as a third baseman during his pro debut. But regardless of where he plays, they feel his bat will profile well at either corner infield position.",0
GPE with power projection and pretty swing that likely ends up in right field. Some see him as a more physically projectable version of PERSON.,0
"PERSON barely saw the mound his first three years at ORGANIZATION, redshirting as a walk-on in 2014, walking more batters (three) than he retired (two) in 2015 and getting cut the following year. A new coaching staff was impressed by his performance during summer and brought him back to the ORGANIZATION, for whom he ranked second in ORGANIZATION Division I in strikeout rate (14.5 per nine innings) as a redshirt junior in 2017. After signing for a below-slot $250,000 in the fifth round, he pitched well in the ORGANIZATION system before getting traded to the ORGANIZATION along with PERSON and PERSON this July.PERSON sits in the low 90s with his fastball as a starter and has reached 96 mph in shorter stints. He has a lanky 6-foot-5 frame with room to add strength and thus more velocity, though at age 23 it's unclear how much projection he has remaining. He doesn't need to throw harder, however, because his heater plays up because of his extension and high spin rate.While he comes with low mileage on his arm, PERSON also lacks experience and needs to refine his secondary pitches. He has made encouraging progress with his curveball in the early going in 2018, giving hope that it can become a solid breaking ball, but his changeup is still in its nascent stages. He has no problems providing strikes and does a good job of keeping the ball down in the zone.",0
"The ORGANIZATION made O'Brien the second-highest pick ever out of Bethune-Cookman when they took him in the third round in 2011, but he opted to transfer to PERSON rather than sign. He went in the second round a year later as a senior, and he has demonstrated consistent power since turning pro. O'Brien led the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League with 10 homers in his pro debut in '12, topped the ORGANIZATION' system with 22 in his first full season in '13 and was third in the Minors with 33 at the time of the 2014 PERSON deal that sent him to GPE for PERSON's raw pop ranks among the best in the Minors, and he can crush the ball out of any part of any ballpark with his combination of bat speed and strength. He hit the longest measured homer during the 2013 ORGANIZATION season, a 455-foot blast. O'Brien does swing and miss a lot, and he doesn't control the strike zone well, so there's some concern as to how much he'll be able to hit for average and tap into his power against more advanced pitchers.There are defensive concerns with O'Brien, as well. He has raw arm strength, though he needs to quicken his transfer and release, and scouts question whether he can refine his receiving and stay behind the plate. O'Brien has seen time at third base and in the outfield, but his lack of speed and quickness may leave first base as his only realistic fallback.",0
"Though PERSON exhibited top-five-rounds talent as an Illinois high schooler, he slipped to the ORGANIZATION in the 12th round of the 2014 Draft because he wanted to attend PERSON. He emerged as the ORGANIZATION' best pitcher early in his freshman year and developed into the program's fourth first-round pick, following PERSON (to whom he was compared in high school), PERSON and PERSON. He went 24th overall in June and signed with the ORGANIZATION for $2,614,500.PERSON had one of the best fastball packages in the 2017 Draft. His heater not only sits at 92-96 mph and tops out at 98, but it also features plenty of sinking and boring action and he commands it well. He misses a lot of bats with his fastball and hitters generate a lot of weak contact when they manage to connect with it.Some scouts question whether PERSON will remain a starter, however, because of his secondary pitches and his low three-quarters delivery. His low-80s slider is more sweepy than sharp and his changeup is still a work in progress because he didn't need it much as an amateur. If he eventually heads to the bullpen, he has the fastball to serve in a high-leverage role.",0
"There are some scouts that believe PERSON has a chance to be a special player. There are others that believe he already is.What scouts agree on is that PERSON is an athletic teen who has a fluid and easy swing. He has quick hands and makes lot of hard contact during batting practice. There's also the belief that PERSON will show more power at the plate as he develops. He's also expected to grow into a complete hitter once he enters a team's academy and receives instruction from an organization's coaches on a daily basis. For now, PERSON is working on spraying the ball to all fields.In the outfield, PERSON is fast enough to cover the gaps and his arm is already strong enough to keep runners honest. If PERSON continues to develop at a normal pace, he profiles as a regular everyday outfielder.PERSON is trained by PERSON.",0
"PERSON was one of the biggest surprises in the first round of the 2013 Draft, generating little pre-Draft buzz for someone who would go 25th overall. But after signing for $1,866,500, he showed everyone what the ORGANIZATION saw in him. PERSON won ORGANIZATION honors in the ORGANIZATION after leading the ORGANIZATION circuit in runs (47), doubles (18), extra-base hits (25), ORGANIZATION (39), slugging percentage (.511) and ORGANIZATION (.898).PERSON found the going tougher in 2014, struggling mightily at low Class A ORGANIZATION, before spraining his left thumb and getting sent to Short-Season Salem-Keizer upon his return. His pure hitting ability and bat speed were more apparent after his demotion. As he gets stronger, PERSON could grow into average power.Because PERSON is just an average runner and athlete, some scouts question how long he can stay at shortstop. But he has solid arm strength and PERSON's brass thinks he has more quick-twitch ability than he gets credit for. PERSON played mostly second base at ORGANIZATION but returned to shortstop at Salem-Keizer.",1
"PERSON originally signed with the ORGANIZATION in March 2014 as the ORGANIZATION showed improvement on both sides of the ball as an amateur. He spent his first two summers in GPE and the ORGANIZATION before making his GPE debut in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION in 2016, then jumped to full-season ball in 2017. The ORGANIZATION got him from the ORGANIZATION in August of that season, but his time with PERSON was short-lived as he was shipped to the ORGANIZATION in March to complete the C.J. PERSON trade.The switch-hitting PERSON has a short, compact swing from both sides of the plate, with feel for the barrel that enables him to produce consistent contact. He shows some pop from the left side of the plate, albeit mostly to the gaps, but offers little in the way of power as a righty, with very good plate discipline allowing his hit tool to play up. PERSON's above-average speed makes him a threat on the basepaths, and he's improved his basestealing efficiency to maximize that tool. Defensively, PERSON has already played a number of positions, mostly in the middle infield, though he has seen time at third and even in the outfield. He has the range, quickness and arm for the left side of the infield and the ORGANIZATION had him playing shortstop during his first season in the organization, though his versatility could come in handy in the future.",1
"An exceptionally athletic, twitchy and lean high school catching prospect, PERSON is a potential plus defender with a plus arm and visible leadership qualities. He also has a chance to grow into above average raw power, but scouts aren't sure if he's going to hit.",1
"Â PERSON was lightly scouted as a lankly and soft-tossing left-hander, but the ORGANIZATION took a flier on the local high school product in the 19th round. Since then, PERSON has made significant strides, and he was one of the key pieces PERSON acquired in exchange for PERSON at the 2013 PERSON Deadline.PERSON's velocity has improved significantly since he signed. His fastball now sits around 90 mph, and it has reached as high as 96 mph. While PERSON's already gotten stronger since signing, there's even more projection left in his frame. His body type and his low three-quarters arm slot lead to comparisons to PERSON Sale.Even with all of his advances so far, PERSON still has plenty of room for growth. His secondary pitches have good potential, but they are inconsistent. PERSON needs to refine his command. He started making those adjustments in 2014 at ORGANIZATION A Lancaster, where he has thrived despite pitching in one of the most hitter friendly parks in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"GPE is rare because he's a righty hitter and lefty thrower and also because he's a standout defender already despite only being an average runner. He has some pop and feel to hit, but there's still some uncertainty about his offensive impact.",0
"Left-handed-hitting middle infielders are always a hot commodity, and PERSON seemed to be cementing his place in the top three rounds as the GPE approached.Oregon State always does a good job of recruiting in its own backyard, finding solid, hard-nosed players to commit. PERSON definitely fits that description, getting very high marks for his intensity and hustle. He has some outstanding tools to go along with his plus makeup, especially his above-average bat that sprays line drives all over the field. PERSON has excellent speed, which helps him as a basestealing threat and in covering ground on the infield. He has the instincts, range and hands to play shortstop with an average arm, though some think he might be best suited for second base.There is little question, however, that PERSON can stay up the middle and develop into an exciting top-of-the-order table-setter in the future.",0
"A 2018 7th round senior sign, PERSON's combination of power and chance to play several positions (including catcher) makes him an interesting potential bench piece.",0
"One of the biggest pop-up guys this spring, GPE sent scouts scurrying to PERSON amid reports that he was hitting 96 mph with his fastball and 86 mph with his slider. While he only flashes that type of stuff rather than maintains it, it's possible that he could sneak into the top three rounds.Though GPE's fastball can climb into the mid-90s, he doesn't tend to hold that velocity and often works at 88-92 mph. His slider has its moments too but he throws it too much and it often devolves into a less powerful pitch with slurvy break.Also a star quarterback for PERSON, GPE has the athleticism and frame to remain a starter. To do so, the ORGANIZATION recruit will have to become more consistent with his fastball and slider, develop a changeup and improve his control and command.",0
"A heady high school infielder from the ORGANIZATION, PERSON really jumped on the map when he made ORGANIZATION's 18 and under national team as an underclassman in 2017. PERSON during the 2018 Tournament of PERSON carried over to the rest of his summer, but he used those difficulties to motivate him to return to a level of consistency during his senior year in Washington.When PERSON is going well, he can do a little bit of everything well, even if he doesn't have a carrying tool that jumps off the page. The switch-hitter can drive balls in the gaps and can stay inside the ball and go the other way when needed while showing good command of the strike zone. There's bat speed and he could eventually approach average power when he physically matures. PERSON runs well and has excellent instincts, both on the basepaths and defensively, where he is a natural leader. He has the hands, actions and arm to play shortstop, though some think second base might be his long-term home. He's also athletic enough to handle the outfield if need be.PERSON gets as high marks for his feel for the game and intelligence as he does for his tools. Whether he gets drafted early enough to forego his commitment to ORGANIZATION remains to be seen.",0
"Sometimes in baseball, a player has to take a step back before he can take a step forward. Perhaps putting too much pressure on himself to get to the big leagues in 2015, PERSON struggled with his move to Triple-A. The ORGANIZATION are hopeful the lessons learned will help the powerful outfielder reach the highest level soon.PERSON still has as much raw pop as just about any prospect in baseball. Few doubt his ability to hit 30 homers annually if he's an everyday player, even with his difficulty in making contact. PERSON will always rack up strikeouts and he spent too much time in 2015 trying not to do so. He does need to improve his pitch recognition and plate discipline, with the hopes that a healthy walk rate will help offset the swinging and missing. PERSON runs well for a big man and his strong arm plays well in right field, where his power also could profile well.Once thought to be the top prospect in the system, PERSON needs to stop pressuring himself to perform as such. A little selectivity can go a long way as his power will play at any level and in any park if he can improve that aspect of his game.",1
"An Ontario native, GPE pitched one season at ORGANIZATION State JC (Okla.) before transferring to ORGANIZATION and serving as the team's closer in 2014. He signed with the ORGANIZATION for $25,000 as a 10th-round pick that June, but missed the entire 2015 season while recovering from PERSON surgery. He returned to the mound fully healthy last June and impressed as part of Class A Lansing's starting rotation, his first work as a starter since 2013, and he's made even greater strides this season as a member of Class A Advanced PERSON's starting rotation. GPE has shown plenty of arm strength post-surgery. His fastball sits comfortably at 92-94 mph, with good life and some run, and reaches 96, and it's easy to see GPE, with his physically strong frame, adding even more velocity. His power slider gives GPE a second above-average pitch, and he's capable of missing bats with both. His changeup is well below average, however, and he'll need to at least make it a viable offering to remain a starter.Most scouts think that GPE will eventually return to the bullpen, where his fastball-slider combination could make him a late-inning option. But with his success over the last two seasons, GPE is looking more and more like someone who can stick as a starter.",0
"PERSON was ORGANIZATION's No. 19 international prospect in July 2016 when the ORGANIZATION inked the GPE for $1.25 million. After he unofficially got his feet wet in the ORGANIZATION Winter League, he turned in a very solid first full season of pro ball, earning a promotion from the Class A Advanced PERSON up to the Double-A PERSON in 2017.PERSON hit well during his time in GPE, a notorious pitcher's park and league, and held his own upon reaching Double-A. He showed an ability to make consistent contact with excellent bat speed and more extra-base thump than anticipated, especially before his promotion, though he is hit over power. His overall approach improved after his bump up, as he walked more and struck out less. PERSON runs well and can steal a base, and he's still learning to use that speed effectively in the outfield. He's capable of playing all three spots and the ORGANIZATION feel he's better in center than expected, showing good range going back and to the gaps. His solid average arm works well from the corners.It was a very positive first step for PERSON, one that puts him close to the doorstep of the big leagues. The outfield is obviously crowded in GPE, but he should be ready to fill a need should one arise in 2018 at the ripe old age of 23.",1
" PERSON has been on radars since the ORGANIZATION gave him $3 million to sign out of the ORGANIZATION. Hitting .353 in his GPE debut didnât hurt and heâs tantalized with his skills since. PERSON appears to have put some of the attitude issues he had during his full-season debut in 2011 behind him and it should be noted heâll still be just 20 years old for all of the 2013 season. PERSON earned a promotion in 2012 and his bat should help him continue to move up the ladder. He has above-average raw power and his approach at the plate has improved, giving him the chance to be an outstanding all-around hitter. Heâs always had a plus arm behind the plate, but there had been questions about his ability to handle the defensive rigors of the position in the past. He did seem to make some strides with the glove, though he needs to continue to work on his receiving skills, and the ORGANIZATION hope that can continue.",1
"A 16th-round pick out of ORGANIZATION II LOCATION in 2012, PERSON made strides at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Jupiter in '14, and he then built on that progress with a strong showing in GPE Fall League. That led to a breakout campaign in 2015 at ORGANIZATION and a promotion to the ORGANIZATION in early August. After underdoing PERSON surgery in 2007, PERSON typically sits in the mid 90s and can get up to 98 mph with his heater. His feel for his curveball has improved in the past year to the point where it's at least an average offering. PERSON also can mix in a slider and a changeup, though neither pitch is particularly advanced.PERSON has worked to refine his delivery, and he threw more strikes than ever last year during his time in the LOCATION. His control regressed upon reaching the Majors, but the right-hander's stuff was plenty good. With his size and arm strength, PERSON has the raw tools to be an impact reliever. He's expected to compete for a spot in the ORGANIZATION' Opening Day bullpen.",0
"A native of GPE, PERSON began his collegiate career at ORGANIZATION Community College before transferring to GPE State. After two solid seasons there, he signed as a senior with the ORGANIZATION for $3,000 in the 37th round of the 2016 Draft. He went from organizational filler to interesting prospect by hitting 17 homers across two levels of A ball in his first full season, then reaching Double-A in his second and hitting 21 more home runs. After impressing in the ORGANIZATION, he was sent to the D-backs as part of the package received for PERSON Goldschmidt.The stocky infielder is mostly all bat, but it's a good one. He's shown the ability to make consistent hard contact from the right side of the plate with at least solid average power. PERSON hits a ton of fly balls and showed his power by smashing a dozen home runs in GPE Beach in 2018, an extreme pitcher's park. While he doesn't walk a ton, he did cut his strikeout rate down considerably in 2018 and showed a much better overall approach in the AFL.PERSON has seen time defensively at three infield positions and a little time in the outfield corners. With below-average speed and a fringy arm, his best bet to be a regular will be at second, with a career as an offensive-minded utility type a possibility.",0
"A two-time national champion at GPE, PERSON parlayed a breakout performance in the ORGANIZATION into a big league callup in late 2014, just two years after being taken in the fourth round of the 2012 Draft. He started slowly last season back at ORGANIZATION but got back on track during the second half and earned his second September callup in as many years.During his time at GPE, PERSON developed a reputation as an excellent hitter, one with a good approach and more gap power than anything else. He finally unlocked his power in 2014, more than doubling his home run total from the year prior, though doing so did cause him to deviate from his approach and swing for the fences too often in '15. Despite being a capable defender at first base, the presence of both PERSON and PERSON ahead of PERSON on the organizational depth chart inspired the GPE to give him a look in the outfield during spring training. He passed every test Baltimore threw his way, and has played left field almost exclusively in 2016. PERSON's outstanding work ethic and overall feel for the game allow him to get the most of his raw tools, and with improved consistency at the plate, he could fit the profile of a regular big league corner player.",1
"GPE of a group of college middle infielders who, while not jumping out as impact type bats, could go in the top few rounds, PERSON has been a three-year starter at ORGANIZATION State some like better than the others from that crop.PERSON is the quintessential scrappy college gamer type, but one with some tools he can count on. PERSON has plus speed, his carrying tool on both sides of the ball. It allows him to have enough range to stay at shortstop defensively and to be a base-stealing threat offensively. He has enough arm to play the premium position, though his best chance at being a regular might come at second baseman in the future. What kind of profile PERSON has will depend on his bat. There's no power to speak of, but if he hits he could be a speedy every day guy on the right side of the infield. At worst, there's a high probability of him becoming a valuable utilityman at the big league level.",1
"Though GPE wasn't a highly touted recruit when he arrived at FACILITY, he claimed a spot in the weekend rotation at the start of his freshman season and never relinquished it. He has performed consistently for the ORGANIZATION and could become their highest-drafted pitcher since the ORGANIZATION took PERSON seventh overall in 2010. He's missing more bats than ever this spring and could go in the second round.Scouts quibble about which of GPE's pitches is his best because there are three legitimate candidates. He doesn't blow hitters away with a fastball that sits at 90-92 mph and tops out at 94, but it plays up because he commands it so well and generates good downhill plane and running action. His cutter/slider can be a weapon, though he can fall in love with it, and his tumbling changeup could become a plus offering if he used it more.GPE's athleticism enables him to repeat his high three-quarters delivery and throws strikes with all of his pitches. He even can mix in a curveball for show when desired. He's unlikely to become a frontline starter, but he's one of the better bets in this year's college crop to settle in the middle of a big league rotation.",1
"PERSON had a rocky career at ORGANIZATION, always tantalizing scouts with stuff but struggling with health and control. The PERSON made PERSON their 2015 second rounder, but he didn't sign and fell to the sixth round as a 2016 senior. PERSON simplified his delivery in 2017, which probably contributed to a breakout year. He seemed likely to spend most of 2018 at ORGANIZATION and perhaps reach the majors in 2019, but he had elbow issues during the spring and didn't break camp with an affiliate. His GPE rehab was successful enough for PERSON to get on a mound in games for a bit, but he felt continued discomfort and needed PERSON. The mid-summer timing of the surgery means he'll likely miss all of 2019, which means he'll be back when he's a few months shy of 26. The time crunch alone makes it likely that he ends up in relief, though PERSON could move quickly and be a strong, late-inning piece when he returns.",0
"After landing a modest $45,000 bonus at the relatively advanced age of 18 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2014, PERSON emerged as one of the best arms in the ORGANIZATION' system. He came straight to the GPE for his 2015 pro debut and earned rapid promotions in each of his first three pro seasons. His control lapsed last year, but he still recorded a 3.44 ERA at two Class A stops because he was able to overpower hitters. He reached Double-A for the first time in GPE, only to then be dealt to the ORGANIZATION later in the month with PERSON and PERSON in exchange for PERSON. PERSON can blow his fastball by hitters, ranging from 93-99 mph with two-seamers with nice sink and four-seamers with explosive riding life. He also can produce wipeout breaking stuff when he's on, though there are times when he can't find the strike zone with his slider or curveball. He uses a splitter as a changeup, and it likewise can elicit swings and misses or avoid the plate.Opponents struggle to make solid contact against PERSON, who has four pitches that can grade as plus or better but lose effectiveness when he can't tame them. He's athletic enough to figure out control and command, but his delivery has timing issues that have prevented him from throwing consistent strikes. His walk rate jumped from 4.5 per nine innings in his first two seasons to 6.5 in his third, a sign that he's more likely to become a late-inning reliever than a frontline starter.",0
"A second-round pick in 2014, when he won ORGANIZATION USA player of the year honors while at ORGANIZATION, PERSON didn't have much offensive success above low Class A until last season. Despite missing two weeks with a concussion, he set career highs in most categories, including batting (.274), slugging (.485) and homers (17). But after hitting well in Double-A last August, he hasn't been able to replicate that success in 2018.PERSON is at his best when he shortens his right-handed swing, enabling him to pull pitches more consistently. His strength and the loft in his stroke could produce 15 or more homers per year with regular playing time at the big league level. He has gotten more aggressive as he has progressed through the ORGANIZATION and will need to tighten his strike zone to succeed against more advanced pitching.PERSON has worked hard to get better defensively. He has made himself into an average receiver and also has enhanced his footwork and accuracy with his throws. Because PERSON already has the game's best catcher in Buster Posey and spent the ORGANIZATION. 2 overall pick in the 2018 Draft on another backstop in GPE, he may never be more than a backup and has begun playing first base to add to his versatility.",0
"GPE has the class' most electric arm and he somehow finds a way to throw strikes even though his arm action is all over the place. His arm slot's variability alters the shape and plane of all of his pitches and really isn't sustainable, long term. He'll need to find mechanical consistency to start. If he does, because he pretty clearly has the best raw stuff in the class, he has its highest ceiling.",0
"Thought to be one of the best college pitching prospects at the start of the 2015 season, PERSON slumped late in the year, causing him to slide to the ORGANIZATION at ORGANIZATION. 35 overall. He opted to return to GPE for his senior year rather than sign and struggled for much of the 2016 season. This time around, though, he bounced back late and landed in the fourth round, getting a $750,000 bonus, more than $200,000 above pick value.PERSON worked at 92-94 mph, touching as high as 97 mph for much of his junior season, but was down to 88-92 mph with a slider that wasn't as sharp and a changeup that wasn't as effective as it had been in the past, and he struggled with command, something that was an issue at times in his college career. Some chalked up the regression of his stuff to slower arm speed, but that rebounded down the stretch, and some scouts felt he was throwing better than he ever had at the end of his senior campaign.If the Tigers can harness the PERSON that showed up for most of 2015 and at the very end of 2016, they might have a mid-rotation starter, and a fourth-round bargain, on their hands.",0
"It's becoming fairly clear that PERSON simply hits. He hit in the ORGANIZATION, then finished second in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION in batting average during his 2011 GPE debut. The move up to the LOCATION in 2012 didn't faze him as he continued to show the ability to make consistent contact. The young ORGANIZATION has shown a pretty good approach at the plate and while he's not the biggest guy in the world, he might have a litte extra-base power. He has excellent speed that should help him on the basepaths. PERSON played multiple positions in the past, but settled in at second base in 2012 and it looks like he should be a solid defender there.",0
GPE has parlayed a strong Cape showing into attention this spring where he flashes #3/4 starter upside with a low-to-mid-90's fastball and a plus changeup. Went lower than talent suggested in the draft due to needing TJ after signing.,0
"PERSON PERSON's presence in PERSON made the fast-approaching PERSON expendable in trade, and PERSON sent him to GPE for PERSON at the 2018 deadline. A 2017 breakout that saw PERSON slug .424 at ORGANIZATION seemed to be a mirage when he hit just .245/.303/.350  for three months at ORGANIZATION (that power output is closer to career norms), but after the trade PERSON slugged .562 and his ground ball rate dropped from 44% to 33% in about a 100 balls-in-play sample, which should be fairly stable. If there's suddenly more lift here then PERSON could be a top 100 prospect by mid year. He's going to stay at short (plus range, average hands, above-average arm) but the average big league shortstop had a 95 wRC+ last year and PERSON is a very aggressive hitter likely to run below-average ORGANIZATION. If there's been a swing change (his swing with PERSON was not conducive of power) then extra pop might propel PERSON toward toward regular playing time. If not, he's a low-end everyday player or utility man.",1
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON, an ORGANIZATION commit, was named to the ORGANIZATION team at the 2016 Perfect Game National Championship and was also a preseason All GPE in both 2015 and 2016.Schroer has a large frame and a well-proportioned body. The right-hander has fair command of both his fastball, which sits at 87-88 mph, and his curveball, which lacks consistent bite.Schroer is still developing his power but makes solid contact and has a medium-length swing with an uppercut finish.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION back in 2011, PERSON has always intrigued with his size and arm strength. Pegged for the bullpen very early in his pro career, the big right-hander has the chance to make an impact as a late-inning reliever in the future.PERSON has always thrown hard, with a fastball that typically sits in the mid-90s. He can reach back for something extra and touches 98-99 mph with regularity. He scrapped a curveball for a developing, and more effective, slider and he'll mix in a changeup on occasion to keep hitters honest. Especially for a power arm, PERSON does an excellent job of throwing strikes, though he was more hittable than one would expect when he made his full-season debut in 2014. Some of that could be attributed to the bandbox in GPE, and he made a big step forward as he moved up the ladder in 2015, finishing the year in Double-A, opening some eyes in the ORGANIZATION and earning a spot on the 40-man roster.Giving someone a ""future closer"" label is always dangerous, but if PERSON can continue sharpening his breaking ball to go along with his plus fastball, he has the potential to make that kind of contribution.",1
"GPE is a commodity that's hard to come by in prospects. When one combines it with an outstanding college season swinging the bat, he's likely to rise up ORGANIZATION boards. That's what happened with ORGANIZATION, who hit .384 as a GPE junior to land him at pick No. 33 in 2017. Though he was banged up, he had a strong pro debut in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League and was holding his own during his full-season debut in the GPE League until a sprained elbow shelved him in June. A move to Double-A in 2019 produced mixed results and he was sent to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON in mid-July.ORGANIZATION should be able to use his legs to wreak havoc on the basepaths. He's still learning his left-handed swing and he had a tendency to hook balls on the ground early on. He's now working on getting some separation so he can impact the ball, and he's learning to slash the ball to the left side so he can use his legs to help him more. The combination of approach and speed could make him an above-average hitter, albeit one with little power, in time. It's unclear what ORGANIZATION's long-term defensive home will be. He's unorthodox defensively at short, with a fringy arm, but he does have impressive range. He impressed in big league camp during 2018 Spring Training, playing on both sides of second base. He also played some outfield in college, though he's played shortstop almost exclusively as a pro.It could be that ORGANIZATION ends up fitting a super-utility role at the big league level, with his speed playing at a number of positions, though it's too early to rule out an every day gig at second base. Most importantly, he's making up for lost at-bats in 2019.",0
"PERSON was a part of GPE's back-to-back national championships and has established a long track record as a successful hitter. He adjusted well to the professional ranks, reaching Double-A PERSON in his first full professional season.PERSON has a good approach at the plate and has an excellent feel for the barrel. He has unlocked more of his power as a professional, and he blasted 20 home runs in the first half with PERSON in 2014. Defensively, PERSON is strictly a first baseman, but he has the tools to be a solid defender.PERSON earns praise for his understanding of the game, and as he taps into more of his raw power, fits the traditional first-base profile better now than scouts thought he would when he was at GPE.",1
"Stop if you've heard this one already. Here's another high school catcher with a chance to be impressive on both sides of the ball.Left-handed-hitting catchers are always a hot commodity, and PERSON has the chance to really hit at the next level, both for average and power. PERSON love his strength both at the plate and behind it.His best tool defensively is his arm, which is plenty strong enough. He needs to continue to work on the other parts of his glove game, but he shouldn't be one of those prep catchers who will have to move from behind the plate, with the potential to be an everyday catcher at the highest level.",1
"PERSON was listed at 235 pounds on the 2015 Area Code Games roster but was tipping the scales at 260 not long before that. At that event, he was sitting in the 90-92 range with feel for locating a solid-average curveball. He looked like a mature-bodied pitchability prospect whose stuff might be done improving. During that fall and winter, though, PERSON began to reshape his physique. He dropped about 50 pounds and came out the following spring with much better stuff, his fastball creeping into the 93-95 range and touching 97. 
PERSON and his stuff have continued to improve, though he had a somewhat chaotic 2018. He missed the season's first 50 games due to a suspension for the use of an unknown stimulant, then had his season debut pushed back due to a lat strain. He finally toed the rubber at ORGANIZATION in June and made five four-inning starts before he was removed in the first inning of his sixth outing and placed on the ORGANIZATION with an oblique strain. He missed a little over a month, then made two more starts in August before feeling lat discomfort warming up for what would have been a third. He was shut down as a precaution and sent to the ORGANIZATION to pick up innings. 
His stuff was wholly intact in GPE, as PERSON sat 93-97 and touched 99. His apparitional changeup haunts both left and right-handed hitters, disappearing beneath barrels as it approaches the plate. PERSON's array of breaking stuff is well-designed. His power 12-6 curveball honors his GPE heritage but has been de-emphasized as an out pitch in deference to his tilting, mid-80s slider. He has the best collection of stuff in the minor leagues, and might have been in the big leagues last year if not for various setbacks. He may be on somewhat of an innings limit this year because he didn't pitch all that much in 2018, but barring that, we expect he'll help the ORGANIZATION cause at some point in 2019. ",0
"One of the better prep hitters in the 2015 Draft class, PERSON, who went by PERSON at that time, signed for $2.7 million as the ORGANIZATION. 15 overall pick. While he hit well that summer in his pro debut, finishing with a .309 average, PERSON has struggled at the plate in each of the next three years, showing little in the way of average or power, albeit as a younger player at each level, as his prospect stock declined. That changed in 2019, though, as PERSON rebounded remarkably to hit for average and produce legitimate power numbers while climbing from Double- to Triple-A. For years PERSON was unable to find his comfort zone as a hitter, and he looked particularly lost at the plate in 2018, setting up so far off the plate with an open stance that his front foot was borderline out of the batter's box. PERSON's stance, along with his naturally passive approach, opened the door for pitchers to attack him, and he struggled to drive the baseball even when he got a hittable pitch. The ORGANIZATION determined that PERSON's point of contact was consistently too deep, and they worked with him ahead of the 2019 season on hitting the ball more out in front. The results from that adjustment have been staggering, as PERSON is now clearing fences with ease while consistently driving to ball from pole-to-pole. What's more, he's tapped into that power without it detracting from the plate discipline and on-base skills that have been a staple in his pro career.An average runner who earns high praise for his ability to read pitchers and steal bases, PERSON swiped a career-best 38 bases in 2017, but just 11 last year in Double-A. Defensively, PERSON primarily plays left field but has seen time at all three outfield positions throughout his career.",1
"Performing well in the ORGANIZATION is always a plus for college hitters, and PERSON set himself up extremely well this summer, winning the ORGANIZATION MVP award while reaching double-digits in home runs and steals.PERSON's a good pure hitter with some pop, and he has plus speed to go along with it. That speed allows him to play a good center field.The only knocks against him might be that he's not the biggest guy in the world and he doesn't play for a huge college power in GPE. He continued to perform like he did in the ORGANIZATION during his junior season, keeping many teams very interested.After a very strong sophomore season on both sides of the ball, PERSON kept it going for ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION over the summer. He carried it over to his junior season, pitching and hitting well for the 'Zags. Clearly a very good athlete who can handle the bat, it's his left arm that could have him drafted in the first round in June.",0
"PERSON was a high profile amateur, closing for ORGANIZATION and PERSON before PERSON took him in the third round in 2015. They didn't add him to the 40-man this winter and the ORGANIZATION took him in the Rule 5 as an MLB-ready middle reliever who flashes two plus pitches at times. The bump in the road that led to not adding PERSON to the 40-man roster was a shoulder aneurysm that derailed his 2016 season. He needed a surgery that transplanted a vein from his groin into his shoulder in order to repair it, and the industry worried at the time that the injury threatened his career. His above-to-plus stuff is back and PERSON is at least a big league-ready middle reliever with a chance to be a set-up man. There was some suggestion by scouts that PERSON wasn't the type of pitcher who excels with all of the data and information that PERSON offered; PERSON's approach with him will reflect that. UPDATE: PERSON was returned to the ORGANIZATION on 6/24/19.",0
"GPE has as much raw power at age 19 as many mid-20s 4A sluggers do. He's going to have elite raw power at peak and leads the minors in home runs, but beware of all the whiffs. He could be baseball's top prospect in a year if he solves his contact issues.",0
"GPE's best prep pitching prospect since PERSON went 12th overall to the ORGANIZATION in 2006, PERSON helped PERSON win the 18U World Cup in GPE in September. Coached by his father PERSON at GPE (Ala.) High, he's part of a typically strong ORGANIZATION recruiting class. He has been better than ever this spring, impressing a throng of scouts with a shutout at the ORGANIZATION in March and pitching his way into the upper half of the first round.PERSON spins one of the best curveballs among high schoolers in the 2016 Draft class, a 76-80 mph bender with good depth, though he can fall in love with his breaking ball at times. He also throws an 88-94 mph fastball with deceptive angle and some late life. Both pitches figure to add more velocity once PERSON strengthens his athletic frame.PERSON has feel for a changeup that has shown signs of developing into a plus pitch as he has used it more as a senior. With his loose, whippy arm and clean delivery, he shouldn't have trouble remaining a starter in pro ball. PERSON has a ceiling of a No. 2 starter and a relatively high floor for a high school pitcher.",0
"A 2014 Freshman All-American as a third baseman at FACILITY, PERSON has spent the last two years behind the plate. His offense has suffered and his defense is inconsistent, yet he still flashes enough ability to project as a big league catcher if he can make some refinements. PERSON has good feel for hitting and makes consistent contact from the right side of the plate, though he walks infrequently. His strength stands out more than his bat speed and most of his current pop comes in the form of doubles, but some scouts think he could develop average power. Whichever team drafts him also could return him to the hot corner and hope his bat shows the promise it did two years ago.It's more likely that PERSON will enter pro ball as a catcher. He can demonstrate solid arm strength and reliable receiving skills, though at times his release gets too long and he'll clank balls off his mitt. He's a well below-average runner but has enough agility behind the plate.",1
" The ORGANIZATION stayed in their own backyard for this first-round pick. The former GPE prep star features two above-average pitches, with a fastball that runs up to 94 mph with above-average life and a curve with a three-quarter, tight rotation to it. His changeup, like with many young pitchers, is behind his other offerings, and he needs to improve his overall command. A two-way player in high school, he's a good athlete, which should help him in repeating his delivery in the future. He has outstanding mound presence and aggressiveness on the mound. PERSON was one of the younger players in his GPE class, and though he has passed every test so far, the ORGANIZATION have been careful to bring him along slowly.",1
"When the ORGANIZATION signed PERSON out of the ORGANIZATION in October 2011, they knew he was all about projection. After making his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2014 and finally getting the chance to play ""under the lights"" in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in 2015, that's still very much the case, though PERSON shows exciting glimpses of where he could be headed.Pure stuff-wise, the right-hander who will be 22 for all of the 2016 season has the chance to be a solid starting pitching-prospect. His fastball is plus, touching the mid-90s and occasionally a bit more. He can spin a breaking ball and has a feel for a changeup and while both are inconsistent right now, they could be at least PERSON average in time. More than anything, he needs to work on repeating his delivery consistently so he can execute and command his pitches.Worst-case, PERSON could be shortened up and be very effective as a hard-throwing reliever, but it's way too early to give up on his potential as a starter.",0
"GPE boosted his profile by topping out at 93 mph at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship last October, and he has continued to perform well against top competition this spring. He limited PERSON (GPE) and PERSON, the best position prospect among ORGANIZATION high schoolers, to one run in five innings in a ORGANIZATION showdown in late April. Though PERSON does a good job of holding onto its GPE-area recruits, his projectability could entice a pro team to buy him away from college.GPE works at 89-93 mph with his fastball, compensating for modest life by using his 6-foot-4 frame and high-three-quarters arm slot to create angle and plane. He has plenty of room to add strength and could start reaching the mid-90s regularly once he fills out. He has advanced feel for a changeup, selling it with deceptive arm speed and achieving some fade.After flashing a solid slider on the showcase circuit, GPE has seen it become more fringy this spring and has lost some trust in his breaking ball. He has an easy delivery and repeats it well, allowing him to work both sides of the plate. He's reminiscent of PERSON in the way he works faster than most pitchers while pounding the strike zone.",0
"As the ORGANIZATION approached, the scouting industry was divided about GPE's upside, but there were enough teams who found his offensive profile intriguing to make him a candidate to be taken in the top three rounds.GPE does bring a combination of strength and bat speed to the right side of the plate. He uses a leg kick for timing, whipping his bat through the zone to make loud contact. His power shows up particularly to the pull side and there's hope there will be enough to profile at an outfield corner. A fringy runner, GPE has solid baserunning instincts and while not a burner, he can cover enough ground to be a capable outfielder. Those not in the GPE camp may not think he profiles well enough for an outfield corner, but the team who likes the offensive potential will try to take him early enough to woo him away from his ORGANIZATION commitment.",0
"ORGANIZATION registered on the national scene in 2014 when he threw a complete-game shutout in the ORGANIZATION World Series, capping off two years of effective starting for a top-notch GPE program. His junior season was not as effective, but the ORGANIZATION thought enough of him to take him in the fifth round and watched him turn in another gem in GPE before signing in mid-July. He handled an assignment to the Class A Advanced PERSON to begin his first full season without difficulty, earning a promotion after just five starts. Double-A initially proved to be a stiffer challenge, but the left-hander appeared to be making adjustments as the year progressed. ORGANIZATION is the quintessential pitchability college lefty. When he's on his game, he's a master strike-thrower with a solid three-pitch mix. He'll throw his fastball in the 89-91 mph range and do a very good job of mixing in his slider and changeup to keep hitters off balance. His command suffered as a junior, partially because of pitch selection and partially because of a blister issue that bothered him on and off throughout his college career. Part of his problems in Double-A revolved around difficulties finding the strike zone. There is some projection to ORGANIZATION and his 6-foot-3 frame. Even with his inconsistencies, his track record says he has every chance to start at the big league level, albeit with the ceiling of a No. 4 or 5 starter.",0
"Developing high school catching is a tough exercise. When that catcher comes from a cold-weather area like western GPE, even more patience is needed. The ORGANIZATION initially drafted PERSON from PERSON in the fourth round of the 2013 Draft. He made it to full-season ball in 2015, but missed a large chunk of that year with a foot injury. With his bat not developing, PERSON sent PERSON to PERSON in August 2016 in return for PERSON. He was on the move again after a year with the ORGANIZATION, coming to the A's to complete the ORGANIZATION trade. Things started to click a bit in his first year with GPE and he reached Double-A for the first time, though he struggled once he arrived.A long-limbed, switch-hitting backstop, PERSON stands out more for his work behind the plate than at it. He receives well and has a strong arm that's allowed him to throw out just over 34 percent of potential basestealers heading into 2019. PERSON started to swing the bat with a bit more authority over the past two seasons and hit well in the GPE League before stumbling post-promotion. He has more of a line drive approach now, but he shows some raw power in batting practice and still has room to add strength. While it's more leverage than bat speed, you can dream on some future pop.The A's would love to see PERSON play with a little more urgency. A slow heartbeat for a catcher isn't a bad thing, but some added energy could help him reach the big leagues as a backup backstop.",0
"He outhit PERSON (the ORGANIZATION. 2 overall pick in the 2015 Draft) in each of the last two seasons at ORGANIZATION, but it wasn't PERSON's bat that got him drafted in the second round in June. Instead, it was his defense and speed that earned him a $750,000 bonus.The best defensive center fielder in college baseball in 2015, PERSON has tremendous range thanks to his terrific reads and jumps and his well above-average speed. Some scouts grades his fly-catching ability as a 70 on the 20-80 scale. He has a weak arm but that doesn't detract from his overall brilliance in center.Though there's too much going on in PERSON' approach at the plate, he does a good job of making contact and uses his quickness to get on base. He has the speed and instincts to steal bases, though he offers little in the way of power.",1
"The state of GPE features two of the best college shortstops in this year's Draft. PERSON's PERSON looks like a lock to go in the first 10 picks, while PERSON is a projected second-rounder who should supplant PERSON as the highest-drafted position player ever from GPE-Lafayette.Thought he played third and second base in deference to PERSON on the GPE collegiate national team last summer, PERSON is capable of sticking at shortstop in pro ball. He has range to both sides, reliable hands and a strong arm. He tends to flip sidearm throws to first base, however, costing him some zip and accuracy.PERSON has well above-average speed but sometimes gets too power-conscious, which leads to swing and misses and harmless flyouts. He'll need to improve his pitch recognition and learn to tone down his approach to take better advantage of his quickness.",0
"Is PERSON the top shortstop from the ORGANIZATION in this year's class?Let the debate begin.Here's what we know: PERSON has the potential to be a five-tool player and has very polished actions on offense and defense for his age.On defense, he has soft hands and good body control. He has strong arm that continues to improve. He might not wow scouts with explosive actions on defense but he has good range and many project him as an everyday shortstop in the big leagues one day.PERSON has slight upstroke on his swing from both sides of the plate and hits the ball hard from each side of the batter's box. It's clear PERSON has idea of what he wants to do when he steps to the plate. The shortstop has shown gap-to-gap power and that part of his game is expected to improve as he matures. Scouts rave about his overall hitting potential.He trains in the ORGANIZATION with PERSON.",0
"PERSON's development has been a rollercoaster after going in the first round in 2013 out of an Atlanta-area high school. He's always has plus raw power, but his motor, defensive home and in-game contact/power balance have varied year-to-year.",0
"A product of a Mount St. PERSON (GPE) program that has yielded eight big leaguers, most notably PERSON, PERSON was GPE's top prep pitching prospect in 2014, but he slid to the ORGANIZATION in the 21st round because he was committed to PERSON. He had shoulder issues as a freshman and battled the strike zone as a sophomore before breaking out in the ORGANIZATION last summer. He's the ORGANIZATION's best pitching prospect since PERSON in 2006, but an inability to throw strikes again this spring got him banished to the bullpen.Splitting his time as a starter and reliever on the GPE, PERSON displayed an interesting four-pitch mix while recording a 0.55 ORGANIZATION and an .086 opponents' average -- both of which would have led the league if he hadn't fallen a few innings shy of qualifying. His best pitch is a 92-94 mph fastball that tops out at 96, though both his hard curveball and slider can be plus offerings at times. He also shows the makings of an effective changeup with some sink.PERSON still has projection remaining in his skinny 6-foot-4 frame, which boosts his ceiling even higher. But he won't reach it if he doesn't throw more strikes, and he still ran into trouble with walks while dominating the GPE. He has a loose arm and a fairly simple delivery, so there's nothing glaring that should hamper his control, but it's becoming increasingly likely that he'll be a reliever in pro ball.",0
"PERSON was a solid 2nd round pick most of the spring, then his velocity ticked up to 90-94, touching 96 mph down the stretch and top scouts were scrambling to get looks at a later-blooming, cold weather arm.",0
"PERSON's broad, square, muscular shoulders look like they belong to a D1 high school football prospect. He has one of the better frames of all the 17-year-old hitters in pro ball, and plenty of room to add power to a body that already produces a lot of it. PERSON has explosive hands and a natural uppercut swing. He hits many more balls out during BP than is typical for a hitter this age, and has taken his peers deep in games, too. 
PERSON's feet and actions are workable on the infield but he struggles with throwing velocity and accuracy when he's forced to throw from a lower arm slot, as shortstops often are. If he can't correct that, he'll need to move to the outfield. If he can, this is a shortstop with 80 bat speed. PERSON is a potential superstar. Much of his profile (the plate discipline, ultimate defensive home) is still not in focus, but this young man has rare physical talent.",0
"PERSON toiled for five summers in the ORGANIZATION system but couldn't get out of rookie ball because of an inability to throw strikes. The D-backs signed him out of indy ball, and while the strike zone still wasn't his friend, the ORGANIZATION rolled very low-risk dice by taking him in the ORGANIZATION phase of the 2015 Rule 5 Draft. He pitched across two levels of full-season Class A ball, got added to the 40-man roster at the end of the 2016 season and made his big league debut in 2017.Earlier in his career, PERSON had some serious difficulty with direction to the plate, contributing to his wildness. That has been addressed with some success, and while he still walks too many, he is able to more frequently attack the zone with his two plus pitches. Even if he's more control over command and getting too much of the plate, he's still successful because of how good his raw stuff is. He'll throw his fastball in the 95-100 mph range, and according to the data the ORGANIZATION collect, he has one of the best curveballs in the system.PERSON came back from his 2016 success with a breakout year in 2017 that saw him get big league innings. He has the stuff to pitch in the back of a bullpen, with an ultimate role somewhat dependent on how consistently he can throw strikes.",0
"PERSON and his teammates from PERSON in GPE spent more than a month in the GPE playing against top high school teams from GPE earlier this year. There's a real possibility the young infielder will get a chance to see a lot more of the country in the near future.A legitimate shortstop prospect, PERSON has the tools to stay at the position as he develops. What's more, some scouts think he has the potential to be above average in every facet of the game, except for power. That said, there's the belief that PERSON could still hit at least 10 home runs when he gains strength. He can also spray the ball to all fields.Scouts view PERSON as a good defender with solid fundamentals, and they compare him to PERSON infield prospect Hak-Ju Lee. PERSON has been scouted heavily by the ORGANIZATION.",0
"For much of his high school career, ORGANIZATION was splitting his focus between baseball and quarterbacking for a football program often known as ""Quarterback High.""The athletic third baseman gave his full attention to the diamond in his senior year and scouts are intrigued by the left-handed-hitting third baseman's potential. He makes consistent hard contact using a quick stroke. There's power to come, especially given ORGANIZATION's projectable frame that has a lot of room to add strength.ORGANIZATIONlooks like has the tools to stick at third as well, giving him the chance to be a very intriguing high-upside high school hitter in this year's PERSON class.",1
"He doesn't have sleeves (which is the nature of the garment) but PERSON still does a good job hiding the ball from hitters. His deceptive, overhand delivery looks like a trebuchet and creates late carry on his fastball, which sits 94 and touches 97. His secondary stuff is more average, but PERSON's delivery gives him some margin for error when he misses in the zone. He'll still need to improve how he locates his secondaries to miss big league bats and be a roster lock reliever.",0
"PERSON drew a $1.5 million bonus as a 16-year-old in 2015 and he's a perfect example of the reward in signing a top July 2nd prospect as his tools have taken a huge step forward since signing: his run grade jumped from 60 to 80, his arm from 60 to 70, his raw power from 45 to 55 while he's also become arguably the best defender at any position in all of minor league baseball. The only issue for PERSON are tweaking the mechanics of his swing. He needs to lift the ball more and have a stronger base to tap into some of his power and allow his athleticism to play. These are fixable things, he's just turned 19, he has plenty of hitting tools to surive until this point on them alone, the ORGANIZATION rave about his makeup and coachability and his athleticism would be world class in any sport. With little improvement, he's a Kevin Pillar 2-3 win type defensive specialist and his upside is a 6+ win type perennial All-Star.",0
"Because PERSON stood 5-foot-5 and weighed 150 pounds midway through his junior year at GPE (N.C.) High, he wasn't a high priority for the 2017 GPE. But that has changed as he grown six inches, added 20 pounds and emerged as one of the fastest runners available. High-level decision-makers poured into GPE to see him throughout the spring and while he generates some mixed opinions, he might not last past the second round.PERSON famously clocked a 3.85 home-to-first time from the left side of the plate in front of several scouts in mid-April and gets running grades from 70 to 80 on the 20-80 scouting scale. Speed is far from his only intriguing tool, as he's a switch-hitter with surprising bat speed and deceptive wiry strength and also possesses a strong arm.There are some questions with PERSON. The ORGANIZATION commit doesn't always play with a lot of energy and some scouts wonder if he has the hands to stick in the infield, though the worst-case scenario is that he'd still be a valuable defender in center field. He'll be 19 years and three months old on GPE day, making him one of the older players in the 2017 crop.",0
"PERSON was outstanding as ORGANIZATION's ace and finished his college career with a 23-9 record and 2.80 ERA, racking up 285 strikeouts over three seasons. The A's selected the right-hander in the second round of the 2014 Draft, and he offered a taste of his potential in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League after signing for $750,000. Although he struggled during his introduction to full-season ball in 2015, PERSON was able to make some adjustments over the course of the season and finished the year on a high note before truly breaking out in '16.PERSON's fastball sits in the low 90s, topping out at 95-96 mph, and has arm-side run and late sinking action. His curveball projects to be above average and is his best secondary offering at the moment, though he also has good feel for a changeup that could be at least PERSON average once developed. His slider was his go-to out pitch at ORGANIZATION, but it's been below average as a pro and requires further refinement.Though pounding the zone has never been an issue for PERSON, his first full season indicated that the quality of his strikes must improve. Some scouts wonder if he'll have the durability to remain in the rotation, although that hasn't been an issue so far. ORGANIZATION officials believe he has what it takes to be a big league starter, and the club's track record of developing undersized right-handers bodes well for his future in the role.",0
"PERSON has two legitimate pitches and a history of success against top competition, so the ORGANIZATION felt comfortable drafting him in the seventh round in 2015, then giving him second-round money to sign him away from ORGANIZATION. The right-hander showcased his potential during his pro debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, posting a 1.66 ERA over nine outings including eight starts, but his 2016 campaign came to and end before it even began when he was diagnosed with a torn ORGANIZATION and then underwent PERSON surgery in April.The Arkansas prep's frame doesn't require much projection, but he has a fastball that reached 97 mph last summer in the ORGANIZATION, and generates a lot of sink and groundouts when he works in the low 90s. PERSON has good feel for spinning a curveball, giving him a second above-average pitch, and he also mixes in a fringy slider. His fading changeup should continue to get better as he uses it more often at the next level.PERSON repeats his delivery well, but not without some effort. The ORGANIZATION will develop him as a starter, but some scouts believe the right-hander is destined for the bullpen, which, in the wake of his elbow surgery, could be his long-term home.",0
"PERSON University has had just three players taken in the top 10 rounds of the June Draft since it was instituted in 1965. The most successful from that group was catcher PERSON, who spent parts of 10 years in the big leagues after being a third-round pick in 1992. A fellow Patriots backstop, PERSON hopes to follow in GPE's footsteps, though it's unlikely he'll hear his name as early in the Draft.PERSON has a solid track record with the bat at PERSON, hitting well over .300 in each of his three seasons as a starter, though he did appear over-matched against quality pitching in the ORGANIZATION last summer. For most of his college career, he's shown outstanding contact and on-base skills, drawing as many walks as strikeouts. Early on this spring, he was selling out on his swing trying to get to his power, but went back to his contact-first approach from the left side of the plate and got back to staying through the ball more effectively. PERSON also runs very well for a catcher, even stealing some bases along the way. His best defensive tool is his above-average arm and while he is an acceptable receiver, he does need to work on his setup behind the plate.There's a dearth of catching, especially in the college ranks, in this year's class, which will certainly help PERSON's status. He has a floor as a left-handed-hitting backup with solid contact skills but could develop into a solid regular if everything clicks.",0
"The ORGANIZATION were undeterred by PERSON's torn ORGANIZATION suffered shortly before the 2013 Draft and feel they perhaps got a steal by taking the ORGANIZATION State product in the seventh round.PERSON repaid their faith in him by swinging the bat during his pro debut, which didn't come until the 2014 season because of the knee injury. He has the purest swing in the ORGANIZATION' system, keeping his bat in the zone for a long time. PERSON uses his hands to hit very well and uses the whole field. He's definitely more a hit for average than power guy and might top out at around 12 homers annually, albeit with good on-base skills. PERSON made a lot of strides defensively during instructs last fall, giving more confidence he can stay at the hot corner long-term, something that had been previously questioned.PERSON may never fit the profile of a run-producing corner infielder, but with that smooth swing from the left side, could eventually be a ORGANIZATION Boggs-lite type player.",0
"PERSON was an early 2016 draft 1-1 candidate (mid-90s, plus changeup) before he tore his ORGANIZATION as a sophomore and missed his entire junior year to rehab. His velocity and feel for locating his fastball both regressed in 2018, but they seem to have rebounded this spring. PERSON has been up to 96, sitting 93-94 early in starts before settling into the low-90s later. It's a two-seamer, one that probably pairs best with his changeup, PERSON's best chance of missing bats. He now has two fringe breaking balls, which is a player dev miracle considering there was a stretch when it was unclear if PERSON would ever have just one. He profiles as a sinker/changeup backend starter.",1
"There wasn't a better story at the 2015 ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON than PERSON. He originally signed with the ORGANIZATION for $725,000 in 2006 and stagnated for four years in low Class A before getting released in 2013. He served stints in three independent leagues before signing with the ORGANIZATION last October, and he has put up huge numbers in the upper levels of the Minors this season.If PERSON gets to the big leagues, it will be his huge power that takes him there. He probably won't post high batting averages and on-base percentages, but he has found more success since toning down what had been an all-or-nothing approach. While PERSON has a strong arm and broke into pro ball as a third baseman, he's strictly a first baseman. He's a well below-average athlete and runner who's a shaky defender.",0
"PERSON has a history of hitting wherever he has gone. He batted .404 playing part-time as a GPE freshman in 2010, then won national junior college player of the year honors after hitting .488 at ORGANIZATION (GPE) JC in 2011. He batted .296 in his first two pro seasons -- then noticeably changed his approach in 2013.PERSON' batting average tumbled to .240 in Double-A, but he also bashed 21 homers. He got too power-conscious and tried to pull too many pitches, but there's a happy medium where he can use his formerly shorter stroke and the whole field, and be a solid hitter with average power.Though he's a below-average runner, PERSON shows good instincts on the bases and the outfield. He has a decent arm and has played on both corners, seeing the majority of his time in left field.",1
"PERSON led the ORGANIZATION with a 1.17 ERA in 2012, and PERSON made him the highest player drafted from GPE in the '13 PERSON. PERSON teamed with PERSON, the team's first-round pick, during their professional debut, and the two will be closely linked for the foreseeable future.PERSON throws his fastball in the low 90s, with good sinking action. His changeup is his best offspeed pitch, and his curveball gives him a third quality offering. PERSON throws all of his pitches for strikes, and he aggressively attacks hitters.PERSON doesn't have PERSON's upside, but his stuff and his advanced pitchability could have him moving quickly toward the ORGANIZATION. He profiles as a durable middle-of-the-rotation starter.",1
"  PERSON underwent PERSON surgery as a sophomore at ORGANIZATION State but came back strong the next year, and the ORGANIZATION selected him in the first round in 2013. He ably handled a challenging assignment to Double-A Mississippi in his first full professional season, though he headed back there in 2015.When he's on, PERSON pitches down in the zone and gets heavy sinking action on his low- to mid-90s fastball. As a result, he creates a lot of groundball outs and surrenders very few home runs. His curveball and changeup give him two more solid offerings, and he aggressively attacks hitters and throws strikes with all three of his pitches.PERSON earns praise for his makeup and understanding of his craft. He has the makings of a solid big league starter, especially if he can continue to refine his offspeed pitches and command as he gets more innings under his belt.",0
"Every Draft, scouts bemoan the lack of college bats worth considering in the early rounds. That's why when one comes out and outperforms expectations, they tend to move up boards. PERSON's performance at GPE this spring fit that description to a T, as the junior shortstop made across-the-board improvements at the plate while showcasing his usual top-of-the-scale speed. Impressed by PERSON's tools and overall development, the A's selected him with the ORGANIZATION. 33 overall pick in June, and then saved money by signing him for less than slot value.There is no question about PERSON's speed. On his high school track team, he ran a 10.6-second 100-yard dash, and that speed translates well on the diamond. He's a definite basestealing threat, one who knows his job is to get on base and wreak havoc. The only player in ORGANIZATION history to lead the club in hitting in three consecutive seasons, the left-handed-hitting PERSON raked a career-best .384 this spring, all while showing some surprising extra-base pop.After manning second base as a sophomore, PERSON was moved to shortstop this year, where his speed helps him range-wise, but his other skills likely fall short. The A's will deploy him there to begin his career, though most scouts see a move to center field in his future, where that speed would really be an asset.",0
"  When two high school shortstops are taken one spot after another, it's bound to create comparison and competition. Perhaps people will take sides in the ORGANIZATION vs. PERSON debate for years, but there's no question both are extremely talented young middle infielders. PERSON didn't head to full-season ball right away, but when he did, he quickly hit his way up a level, then showed off some pop in the ORGANIZATION before getting hurt. PERSON has plus bat speed that should allow him to hit for a ton of power and average, especially if he can refine his approach and gain better plate discipline. Many were ready to move PERSON to third right away, but he showed some ability at shortstop, with a very good arm and good hands. His instincts allow his average speed to play up on both sides of the ball. Even if he has to move to third, his bat should profile just fine there.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
There's not much physical projection here but PERSON has explosive present tools. He's an above average runner with average present raw power and a pull-heavy uppercut approach to contact that lets him get to it in games.,0
"Likely in need of a swing change to profile at first, ORGANIZATION' cut too often slices down at the baseball, and he can only get to his considerable raw power in certain parts of the strike zone. He has good bat control and makes mid-flight adjustments to breaking balls, which he has the raw strength to punish even if the timing of his lower half has been compromised. He's a good hitter, just one we're skeptical will clear the offensive bar at first base without trading some contact for power. ORGANIZATION is also another example of why we should be skeptical of hitters' power numbers at FACILITY.",0
"PERSON is as raw a prospect as is available in this draft and, compounding the risk associated with his profile, he's old for the class. But he's a 70 runner with plus bat speed and has a chance to play a premium position while hitting for power (if he ever learns to hit). So there's huge ceiling here, you just need a telescope to see it.",0
"GPE comes from a baseball family, with a father who made it to Triple-A with the ORGANIZATION, an uncle who played in the ORGANIZATION organization and a brother who currently plays in the ORGANIZATION organization. PERSON has made a name for himself as a three-year starter at PERSON and one of the better performers in the ORGANIZATION Association.A left-handed hitter who plays shortstop for PERSON, GPE could be a favorite of the analytics set because of his outstanding on-base skills and his fairly consistent performance with the bat. He has walked far more often than he has struck out and that, along with his excellent speed, makes him a potential table-setter in the future. There is some raw power to tap into, though it's not a huge part of his game. Stealing bases is and he has been very efficient on that front. Defensively, some see a move off of shortstop, mostly because his fringy arm won't play there. Second base or perhaps even center field might be a better fit.A team taking GPE in the first five rounds will be banking on his bat and on-base skills translating to the pro level. His brother PERSON was taken in the fourth round of the 2016 Draft, 132nd overall, so there could be some family bragging rights on the line.",0
"When PERSON signed for $800,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2011, he had a reputation as one of the best athletes on the international market that year. He has lived up to that billing and more than held his own as the youngest regular in the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League last year.PERSON has very quick hands and a patient approach at the plate, which, along with his well-above-average speed, should allow him to hit for high averages. A legitimate basestealing threat, PERSON has the skills desired in a leadoff man. He makes consistent hard contact, and he could develop some pop if he can add strength to his lean frame.PERSON's speed plays well in center field, too, and he throws better than most players at that position. He already has skipped a level, and he could continue to advance rapidly, putting him on track to reach the Majors at age 22.",1
"One of the youngest players in the 2013 Draft class, PERSON began his pro career at age 17, after the D-backs took him in the second round. He spent two years in GPE's system before going to PERSON as part of the ORGANIZATION trade in November 2014. He continued his quick rise through the Minors the following year and then finished his 2016 campaign with his first taste of Double-A. Returning to the LOCATION in 2017, PERSON turned in his best offensive season as he hit for more average and power and tightened his approach. After the season, the ORGANIZATION added him to their 40-man roster. He was finishing up his first season in Triple-A when he was traded once again, this time as part of the package the ORGANIZATION received for PERSON Pham.PERSON began to tap into his raw power in his first Double-A exposure, and that trend continued in '17 in the form of a career-high 14 home runs, though he didn't keep that up in 2018. It's easy for scouts to forecast even more pop in his future because PERSON still produces the majority of his contact on the ground, albeit while effectively using the entire field. With more lift to his swing and improved ability to turn on the ball, PERSON could emerge as an annual 20-homer threat.A shortstop in high school, PERSON was quickly moved to the outfield by the D-backs. He's an underrated athlete who moves well and has the tools, including a solid-average arm, to become an adequate corner outfielder. Still scraping the surface of his offensive potential, PERSON is seemingly a few adjustments away from putting it all together en route to the ORGANIZATION.",1
"GPE isn't especially exciting, as he has a swing that emphasizes contact and allows almost no power, but he's hit everywhere (he won two Cape batting titles), he's a plus runner and he can play shortstop.",0
"A two-sport star at ORGANIZATION, PERSON averaged 11 points and 4.6 rebounds as the ORGANIZATION' starting shooting guard before sliding over to the mound in March. He quickly impressed scouts with his raw stuff, size and athleticism. PERSON generates easy velocity with his loose, easy delivery. He throws his fastball in the low-90s and touched 95 mph this spring. He also throws a slider, curveball and changeup, though his secondary stuff is still developing. PERSON has never solely focused on pitching before and is understandably raw as a result. He has the skills necessary to quickly make improvements once he gets acclimated to playing professional baseball.",1
"Undrafted out of the ORGANIZATION prep ranks, PERSON spent a year at ORGANIZATION (GPE) JC before going to the ORGANIZATION in the 29th round of the 2013 Draft. While he was initially developed as a reliever, PERSON's success in the role as well as his deep arsenal prompted PERSON to give him a shot at starting. After his strong showing in the 2015 ORGANIZATION, PERSON continued to make strides as a starter this season in his return to the Class A Advanced PERSON before moving up to Double-A Montgomery in late May. However, PERSON's campaign was put on hold in early July when, during his fifth start for the ORGANIZATION, the right-hander suffered a broken thumb on a comebacker. Though he's somewhat undersized at 6-foot-1, 175 pounds, PERSON's lightning-quick right arm generates a fastball that can reach 96 mph, and he does a good job of locating it to both sides of the plate. He supports his heater with a sharp curveball that has late, 12-to-6 action that helps him miss bats. He'll also mix in a decent slider as well a changeup that could serve as a third average-or-better offering for him with improved feel.PERSON's four-pitch mix, track record of being difficult to barrel and solid control profile offer something to dream on as a starter, although concerns about his durability and a lack of a true third pitch may ultimately force him back into a bullpen role. Should that happen, PERSON has the stuff to emerge as an effective setup man for the ORGANIZATION in the coming years.",1
"PERSON has missed all of 2017 with a stress fracture in his back. When healthy last year he was 90-94 with a potential plus changeup and future average curveball. He's a draft eligible sophomore and we know even less about PERSON than other eligible sophs because he missed much of his senior year with various ailments, too.",0
"GPE, athletic, albeit undersized catcher who's athletic enough to project behind the plate. Has keen eye for the strike zone, some bat control, but some risk that his offensive tools won't withstand full-season grind due to lack of physicality.",0
PERSON made adjustments and hit his way to Hi-A as a 19-year-old after a bad first month of 2017. He still chases breaking balls away from him too often but otherwise has great feel to hit and sprays hard contact all over the field. He's a plus runner with the speed to play center field and he should continue to develop there as he accrues more reps (PERSON was a high school infielder and two-sport prospect). He profiles as a table-setting doubles machine.,0
"  PERSON played for the GPE Junior National team while in high school and headed to GPE PERSON after going undrafted in 2011. There, he impressed scouts with his big arm and ideal pitcher's frame. PERSON's fastball touched 97 mph when he worked out of the bullpen in college, though it typically sits in the low 90s when he starts. There is some projectability left in his 6-foot-5, 220-pound frame, and he could end up pitching with a tick more velocity. He also has the makings of solid curveball and is working to improve his changeup. PERSON remains somewhat raw, but the Nationals like the upside and feel he can become a Major League starter in time.",1
"We suppose PERSON could catch on occasion, but he probably shouldn't be back there every day due to issues with receiving and mobility. Despite only fitting at 1B/ORGANIZATION, PERSON' combination of power and on base ability make it likely that he finds his way into regular big league at-bats somewhere, especially if the ORGANIZATION is instituted in the ORGANIZATION. His 19% walk rate was among the best in the minors last year, and just 33% of PERSON' balls in play are on the ground. He's a pretty good three true outcomes prospect, a bat-only 1-2 WAR player Ã  la Josh Bell or PERSON, who we'll likely see in the big leagues by 2020.",1
" GPE love the big left-handed hitter's stroke at the plate, and his body reminds many scouts of PERSON. But it is PERSON's lack of foot speed and a below-average arm that have most wondering when -- not if -- he will move from the outfield to first base. He's a solid fielder and has an accurate arm.Overall, PERSON has notable raw power and one of the best rhythm and timing approaches among all hitters in the international market this year. An average athlete, PERSON has always had the ability to hit for average. But now teenager also understands that he has the ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark, and it sometimes affects his approach. One scout said he would not be surprised if PERSON ended up hitting 40 home runs in the big leagues one day.In the end, PERSON offers an intriguing offensive package, which means clubs interested him must decide how comfortable they are with what has been sometimes described as a ""high-reward-yet-limited skill set"" at this age.",0
"Since signing out of the ORGANIZATION in March of 2013, PERSON has moved slowly up the lower levels of the ORGANIZATION' system. He spent two seasons in the ORGANIZATION before making his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2015 and earning a promotion up to PERSON and the GPE. The 2016 season saw him go to short-season GPE, where he looked poised to make a big leap developmentally.PERSON was throwing very well in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League, showing a solid three-pitch mix and the ability to command them all. His fastball has been in the 93-96 mph range. He backs it up with a curve that has sharp bite, a breaking ball he's shown the ability to throw for strikes and generate swings and misses. He also has a good feel for his changeup.A teenager for all of the 2016 season, PERSON is still ahead of the developmental curve. He'll have to prove he can start, as all 6-foot-1 right-handers do, but his stuff plus his command should give him every chance to do so.",1
"When the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the third round of the 2017 Draft, the hope was the ORGANIZATION State PERSON product would be the kind of advanced college starter who could move rapidly through the system. While he did struggle a bit when he first got there, he did live up to his advanced billing by reaching Double-A in his first full season.PERSON is all about mixing his pitches, his overall feel for pitching and his command, rather than pure stuff, with three offerings that typically grade out as average. He will show an above-average fastball on occasion, with a tweak to his delivery helping him add a tick, though he usually sits in the 90-93 range. He mixes in his average changeup effectively and he'll show an average breaking ball. His ability to keep hitters guessing and fill up the strike zone will continue to be key for him moving forward.After initially struggling in GPE, PERSON made solid adjustments and pitched very well over the season's final month. If he can continue to show that kind of command and crispness of his pitches, he'll be ready to impact the back end of the ORGANIZATION rotation soon now that he's put the injury in his rearview mirror.",0
"Projected as a possible third-round pick in 2014, PERSON blew out his elbow three starts into his junior season at ORGANIZATION and had PERSON surgery instead. He rejoined the ORGANIZATION rotation midway through the following spring and pitched his way into the fifth round in 2015, signing for a below-slot $300,000. His first full pro season went well, as he made 27 healthy starts and led the Class A Advanced PERSON in strikeouts (155) and strikeout rate (9.9 per nine innings).PERSON relies heavily on his lone plus pitch, an upper-70s curveball with good depth. His fastball operates in the low 90s and is effective because he hides it and commands it well. He has trouble against left-handers because his changeup is fringy, and he'll also mix in a decent cutter.Though he had a successful 2016 as a starter, PERSON may be better suited for the bullpen in the long run. Although he held up and maintained his stuff last year, his smaller stature and his medical history are concerns, and he did miss the first two months of 2017 with forearm tendinitis. His fastball has sat at 93-96 mph in shorter stints and his competitiveness would work well in a late-inning role.",0
"O'Conner became the first-ever catcher taken by the ORGANIZATION in the first round of the Draft when they picked him 31st overall in 2010. He struggled offensively at the outset of his professional career and didn't make his full-season debut until 2013, but O'Conner found his footing in the ORGANIZATION State League the next year and parlayed his breakout into a selection to the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON. His bat regressed considerably with the move to Double-A in 2015, while a back injury has kept him off the field entirely so far in '16.O'Conner's plus raw power is still his best offensive tool, and he utilizes it enough to believe he'll produce double-digit homers as well as plenty of doubles. He's aggressive to a fault, though, as his pop comes with a concerning number of swing-and-misses and few walks. O'Conner's swing, meanwhile, is geared toward driving the fastball, which is why he struggled to adjust to a steady diet of secondary pitches last season.Despite not beginning to catch until his senior year of high school, the athletic O'Conner has transformed into an excellent defender behind the plate. He can shut down a running game with his elite arm strength, showing the ability to unleash rocket throws from a variety of arm angles. While his defense lessens the pressure on his bat, O'Conner must consistently hit advanced pitching to carve out a role in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON was an under-the-radar juco athlete in the 2018 draft class who the PERSON popped in the 11th round. His pro debut went well, with the 20-year-old excelling at both short season clubs for PERSON. PERSON is a plus-plus runner who tinkered with the infield in the spring but fits best in center field long-term. He has a good swing and a chance to be a 50 or 55 bat, which would come with little game power. But that, along with his speed and defense, would help make him a high level reserve or low-end regular. The track record is short and BABIP-fueled, but some blazing runners can do that even in the upper levels, so PERSON is one to monitor.",0
" Some international prospects generate a ton of buzz and get huge seven-figure bonuses. Others sign for a lot less and end up being huge bargains. If his debut in the ORGANIZATION was any indication, PERSON will be one of the latter. The undersized lefty impressed scouts as a 17-year-old in the ORGANIZATION in 2012, but injuries held him back in 2013. When healthy, PERSON shows an advanced feel for pitching for a teenager. He should have an above-average fastball that he commands well, a solid curve and even a feel for his changeup. His secondary stuff is still inconsistent, though time is still very much on his side, even after missing most of the 2013 season.",0
"Ultra-twichy infielder with a good frame (ORGANIZATION body comp) for age. Has quick, short stroke, plus bat speed, and an abbreviated finish thorugh contact. Can lift balls down and in but otherwise the wing is geared for all-fields liners and grounder. Has natural feel for contact, stiff-legged runner with good straight line speed. SS/2B/CF defensive possibilities due to speed/range.",0
"After PERSON finished his career at ORGANIZATION in GPE and wasn't drafted in 2013, he returned home to the ORGANIZATION, thinking his career was over. He went to a tournament after he was home, was seen by a ORGANIZATION scout and was subsequently signed in August as a non-drafted free agent.That non-prospect reached Double-A in late June of 2015, a year after he set a record for the ORGANIZATION in the short-season LOCATION with 48 stolen bases. Speed is his best tool and PERSON is a true burner on the basepaths. It also helps him cover ground in center field, where he's played exclusively during his pro career. At the plate, he has no power to speak of, but understands it's his job to get on base and score runs as a top-of-the-order catalyst. With that in mind, he could improve his plate discipline and up his walk rate.What kind of future PERSON has remains to be seen, but even making it to Double-A far surpasses any expectations.",0
"PERSON had three remarkably consistent years at ORGANIZATION and ended his college career with a .340 average. He has excellent hitter's timing and bat control, and his swing is athletic but compact, enabling not only high rates of contact, but also promising contact quality. That's not to say PERSON will have in-game power. He's a line drive hitter, an old school, two-hole type of hitter, the kind who's sort of an endangered species in the current big league hitting environment. Some teams considered PERSON's lack of power to be a bit of an issue in their pre-draft evals and thought he was more of a tweener fourth outfield type, a projection echoed by pro scouts who saw PERSON in the summer and fall. 
He has plus speed, speed that PERSON exhibited during instructional league even after he had been shut down for the summer with a foot injury. His frame is maxed out and he can't afford to slow down much and still be viable in center field every day, but while this creates some long term risk for his profile, he's fine out there right now. His most likely path to a sizable everyday role involves PERSON out-hitting what we currently have projected for his bat.",0
"GPE has produced a fair share of GPE talent over the years, with PERSON and PERSON the most recent examples to get taken in the first round, both in 2015. But there hasn't been much in the way of middle infielders to come from GPE of the ORGANIZATION and while PERSON may not go as high as that pair in 2015, he does have a shot to be a rare GPE shortstop at the next level.The PERSON A&M commit might be a bit unpolished, but he has considerable tools and upside. He has a decent approach at the plate for his age and experience level, with a natural feel to hit. There should be some power in the future as well. PERSON is a plus runner and uses that speed well on the basepaths. He is capable of making the spectacular play defensively and while his arm might grade out as average, he can reach back for more when needed and he's usually very accurate. He will struggle at times with the backhand play, but most feel he can stick at short. If not, he'd make an outstanding second baseman and has enough arm for third.PERSON needs to add strength to his athletic frame, but that should come as he matures. He turned 18 not long before the GPE, giving him plenty of time to fulfill his fairly high ceiling.",0
"PERSON was PERSON's guy on last year's list when he profiled as a contact-oriented, multi-positional bench player with no power. At some point in 2018, his hands became more active and his swing took on more movement, becoming whippy and more explosive, and the quality of PERSON' contact was able to improve without costing him much in the way of contact. It culminated in an eye-opening September cup of coffee -- an apt phrase for PERSON, who plays like he is extremely caffeinated --  during which PERSON slashed .293/.349/.483. September numbers can be noisy because the talent pool has been diluted by roster expansion, but we're cautiously optimistic that PERSON has become a different hitter. Namely, a gap-to-gap hitter capable of really punishing pitchers who try to beat him with heat on the inner half. 
Defensively, he's perfectly fine at third base and in the outfield corners, and fringy at second base; we'd rather not have him play shortstop. PERSON's departure should enable PERSON to see big league reps. We think he's a valuable bench option and has a chance to be more than that.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the ORGANIZATION B of the 2015 Draft, they knew the LOCATION product would likely end up in the bullpen. After a year-plus of letting him start to get innings and work on his stuff, the relief switch was flipped and PERSON took off, pitching his way to Double-A and earning a non-roster invite to big league Spring Training. And while he opened the 2018 season in Triple-A, PERSON was up in the ORGANIZATION making his debut less than a week later. After the season, PERSON was traded to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON Roark.PERSON has always had elite-level power stuff and it really played up once he was pitching in shorter stints. Going right after hitters suits him, and his fastball-slider combination led to a ridiculous 15.1 K/9 rate in 2017. His fastball registers in the 98-100 mph range out of the bullpen, and his hard slider is a big-time swing-and-miss pitch. His changeup will never be fantastic, but he does use it against left-handed hitters on occasion. The biggest thing holding PERSON back is his command. He's walked 5.3 per nine in his career, and issued 12 walks over seven innings in eight outings with the ORGANIZATION. He has closer stuff and the mentality to handle the job, but he'll need to find the strike zone a bit more consistently to get a chance to do it in the big leagues.",0
"A member of ORGANIZATION' weekend rotation, PERSON' PERSON status became more uncertain when he missed a few starts, including the ORGANIZATION tournament, with a sore elbow.When healthy, PERSON is an intriguing left-handed prospect, albeit one who is a bit undersized, though that doesn't tend to concern scouts as much as it does for right-handers. PERSON has the chance to have three Major League-average pitches in his fastball, slider and changeup. They can play up because of his unusual arm slot, leading some to believe he might end up in a bullpen one day. He tends to throw strikes and keep people guessing with his repertoire. There's not much projection here, but PERSON has the stuff and pitchability to find success at the next level.",0
"PERSON was a two-way player out of high school in the GPE area in 2016, but went undrafted and headed to LOCATION. The big right-hander worked more out of the bullpen than in the rotation over his first two seasons, but opened a lot of eyes as a starter in the ORGANIZATION, leading the league in strikeouts. He's been that pitcher ever since, moving his way to close to the top of college arm options in this year's Draft.A physical beast at 6-foot-6, 260-pounds, PERSON has always shown glimpses of solid power stuff, but without consistency or command of it. That's changed this spring as he has shown above-average control for most of his junior season. He's pitched with a fastball typically in the 94-97 mph range, missing a ton of bats thanks to good sink. His slider flashes plus at times and has been a more reliable weapon for him. He has a solid changeup, relying on it in the ORGANIZATION championship game, but he hasn't used it as much this spring. PERSON has managed to keep his large frame in sync and has repeated his delivery in order to fill up the strike zone more effectively. Given that he doesn't have that many starts on his resume, he's a rare college pitcher with projection, something that should get him off the board in the first round, much earlier than his older brother PERSON, currently a reliever in the GPE system, who was drafted by the ORGANIZATION in the 13th round of the 2014 Draft.",0
"Â By reaching Double-A Bowie in his first full professional season, PERSON put himself on the fast track. He returned there in 2013 and led the LOCATION with a 3.26 ERA. PERSON hasn't repeated that level of success this season with Triple-A Norfolk.PERSON's fastball sits in the low-90s, and it can touch 95 mph. He throws from a steep downhill angle and uses his fastball's heavy sink to generate ground-ball outs. None of PERSON's offspeed pitches truly stand out, but he adds to their deception by throwing them all from the same arm slot. Though he fills up the zone, PERSON has more control than pinpoint command.Some scouts think PERSON's stuff would play up in the bullpen. But his build suggests a workhorse starter, and GPE believes he can fill that role in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"Better known at ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, Ala.) as a point guard who led his team to the 2011 6-A state basketball championship, PERSON didn't play baseball until his junior year and went undrafted as a prep senior and junior college freshman. He burst onto the prospect scene in 2013, leading PERSON juco players in batting (.495) and on-base percentage (.568), going 17th overall in the draft and signing for $2,164,000. He reached Double-A at the end of his first full pro season and thrived there in 2015, leading the LOCATION in runs (79), hits (160) and steals (49).Though the FACILITY Sox have moved him quickly and he's extremely aggressive at the plate, PERSON's ability to barrel balls has allowed him to hit .301 through his first three pro seasons. His plus-plus speed makes him a huge basestealing threat, but he won't be able to maximize it or hit near the top of a batting order unless he improves his pitch recognition and plate discipline. With his bat speed and wiry strength, he could produce 15 homers per season. Scouts are split on whether PERSON can play shortstop in the big leagues. He has the necessary actions and enough arm strength, but his hands aren't especially soft and his footwork is erratic, leading to 78 errors in his first 255 pro games. His tools would profile well in center field if he can't cut it in the infield.",1
"PERSON was a well-regarded prospect coming out of high school in 2010, but his strong commitment to ORGANIZATION pushed him down draft boards to the 13th round, where PERSON took him, and he ultimately chose to go to school. He used his three years at ORGANIZATION well and went into the 2013 Draft more physical and with a better feel for pitching. PERSON throws his fastball in the low 90s and commands it well to both sides of the plate. He also throws a curveball and changeup, both of which have the potential to be Major League-average offerings. Some scouts express concern over his arm action, but he repeats his delivery well and earns high marks for his athleticism. PERSON hopes to join a growing line of ORGANIZATION starters in the ORGANIZATION, and he has the tools to one day fit into the ORGANIZATION rotation.",0
"The ORGANIZATION lost their top two picks in the 2014 Draft as compensation for free-agent signings, making PERSON their top selection. He was a part of three GPE state championship teams at ORGANIZATION McCarthy High School, the same school that produced big leaguers PERSON and PERSON Castellanos.While PERSON doesn't have overpowering stuff, he is more polished than most high school pitchers. His fastball sits around 90 mph, with good life. At his best, PERSON throws from a good downhill angle and adds run to the pitch. He has good feel for his changeup and gets good depth to his curveball.PERSON stands out for his control and pitchability. With time, his strong build, stuff and polish could help him develop into a solid Major League starter.",0
"PERSON consistently smoked the ball at the ORGANIZATION Games last August and at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship two months later, establishing himself as one of the best high school hitters in the 2016 Draft. He hasn't looked as sharp while bothered by a shoulder injury this spring, however, and scouts still aren't sure where he'll find a defensive home.When healthy, PERSON has a quick, compact right-handed swing and barrels balls with ease. He has good balance at the plate and recognizes pitches and manages the strike zone better than most prepsters. He has some strength too and could have average or better power.PERSON has some arm strength, but his hands, quickness and athleticism leave something to be desired. The ORGANIZATION recruit works hard and perhaps could become an adequate third baseman. Some teams think catching could be an interesting option, though that would take a toll on his bat, while others wonder if he might wind up as a 5-foot-11, righty-hitting first baseman -- which isn't an attractive profile.",0
"There are the international signees that get big headlines and command huge bonuses, the phenoms who sign at age 16. Then there are those like PERSON, who was 20 when he signed out of the ORGANIZATION in 2013, was initially pitching out of the LOCATION bullpen this season, but has burst on the scene as a legitimate pitching prospect.Big and physical at 6-foot-3, 185 pounds, PERSON spent 2014 pitching in the ORGANIZATION. Now 22, the ORGANIZATION wanted to push him a bit and sent him to full-season LOCATION to pitch in the LOCATION League as a reliever. Given a chance to start in mid-May, PERSON ran with it, pitching mostly off of his mid-90s fastball that can touch 97-98 mph at times. He also has a solid breaking ball and has has shown the ability to both miss bats and get groundball outs.PERSON might have a long way to go, including seeing how he fares at higher levels, but the ORGANIZATION think they might have a surprise find on their hands.",0
"PERSON was one of the more impressive high school hitters in the 2014 Draft class, having won the home run derby at the 2013 Perfect Game All-American Classic and batting .580 with 13 homers in 28 games as a senior. Selected 26th overall and signed for $1,870,500, he struggled with his offensive consistency in low Class A during his first full pro season. He improved in the second half and ranked fifth in the LOCATION League with 16 homers at age 19, but also batted .223 and finished second with 144 strikeouts.PERSON always will be more power hitter than pure hitter, but he's capable of adjusting his approach and producing decent batting averages. In his return to the ORGANIZATION in 2016, he started to improve his pitch recognition and plate discipline, as well as to curb a tendency to still swing for the fences with two strikes. With his bat speed, strength and loft in his right-handed swing, he can hit 20 or more homers per season if he just lets his power come naturally.A high school shortstop, PERSON became a full-time third baseman in instructional league following his pro debut. He's not particularly quick and is still learning, but has the strong arm, enough range and the work ethic to get the job done at the hot corner. Some scouts wonder if he could become a GPE Uggla-style second baseman, while others think he'll wind up in the outfield.",1
"It's often said that adversity can be the best teacher. GPE enrolled in a master class during the first half of 2015 in Double-A. How he finished the year shows just how well the outfielder can make adjustments.The 2012 supplemental first-round pick had just a .700 OPS in the first half of the 2015 season, but GPE had a .941 OPS in the second half of the LOCATION season. The key for the left-handed-hitting outfielder was he didn't chase results and get out of his game plan. An extremely advanced hitter, GPE continued to work counts and draw walks even when he was scuffling. He's going to hit for a high average because of that approach. Just how much power GPE develops has been open to debate, but there's definitely more to come, with a ceiling of 25-homer seasons a distinct possibility. While he struggled offensively, he improved his defense, his throwing and his baserunning.The blip on the radar behind him, GPE is ready to start knocking on the door in GPE. That left-handed swing in GPE ORGANIZATION should be fun to watch in the near future.",1
"The GPE area high school standout was taken by the ORGANIZATION in the sandwich round of the 2012 Draft, but his summer debut ended before it started when he broke his foot during a workout. PERSON made his professional debut in the GPE League in 2013 and ORGANIZATION hopes he can develop into a power-hitting third baseman. He has the kind of frame that should allow him to add strength and he projects to have plenty of pop in the future. There might be some swing-and-miss in his game, but if the power comes, that might not be an issue. PERSON has a solid arm from third, though he's not blessed with a ton of quickness. If his bat comes as expected, though, it could profile just fine at first or an outfield corner.",0
"The last infielder from ORGANIZATION's to make a splash in the ORGANIZATION and then the big leagues was PERSON, who was a first-rounder in 2011 and is now the ORGANIZATION' starting second baseman, a former All-Star and ORGANIZATION winner. PERSON doesn't quite fit on that scale, but then again, few thought PERSON would be this good, either.Like PERSON, PERSON plays shortstop for ORGANIZATION's, but will likely need to shift over to second base at the next level. He has a very good internal clock that helps him slow down the game, and he gets rid of the ball quickly, but many feel his arm, average at best, isn't enough to stay on the left side of the infield long-term. His hands and feet should work just fine at second. Not the biggest guy in the world, PERSON has shown a strong hit tool this spring from the left side of the plate, with an advanced approach that has led to more walks than strikeouts in his college career. He has some extra-base power and can run into a few homers along the way.PERSON isn't going to jump into the first round like PERSON did six years ago, but he is performing well for a good college team at just the right time. A team that sees a little PERSON in him could take him in the top five rounds.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON, a high school senior, has been committed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE since he was a sophomore at ORGANIZATION. Now a team captain, PERSON is hoping for a strong final season as PERSON looks to repeat as state champions.PERSON has a good feel for the bat head and makes consistent contact at the plate with a middle-of-the-field approach.The outfielder has average arm strength but tracks fly balls correctly.",0
"PERSON was among the top GPE high school pitchers in this year's PERSON class and the GPE made him their fifth-round selection in June. He is polished for a high schooler and has the potential for three Major League-average pitches. PERSON's fastball sits in the upper-80s to low-90s. He mixes it with a curveball and changeup, both of which are promising. He has a clean delivery and has a good feel for his whole arsenal. PERSON's advanced stuff and understanding of pitching help make up for his lack of projection. He could move faster than most high school pitchers and profiles as a middle-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"The top two-way player in the 2013 Draft, GPE had the athleticism and left-handed power potential to be a first-round pick as an outfielder. But it became apparent as the spring went on that he was also the best left-handed pitcher available, and he gave up hitting after going seventh overall and signing for $2.75 million.GPE went 1-7, 7.27 in his first 11 starts in low Class A last year, but the struggles helped make him a better pitcher and he finished with a 2.70 in his last 11 outings. His promising curveball was inconsistent for much of the first half, which forced him to rely more on his changeup, and by the end of the season both were solid pitches. He pitched with a 90-94 mph fastball for much of the year, and his projectable frame bodes well for more velocity in the future. Thanks to his athleticism, GPE has better body control than most young pitchers with big frames. He's learning to repeat his delivery and could develop solid command. He'll need time to develop but has the upside of a No. 2 or 3 starter.",0
"GPE shortstop PERSON was a consensus top-three-rounds prospect entering the season, while teammate PERSON has made a huge leap forward to become one as well. GPE-eligible as a sophomore because he'll turn 21 within 45 days of the GPE (on Day 2 of the GPE, actually), he shows at least average tools across the board.A physical specimen at 6-foot-2 and 205 pounds, PERSON has plus raw power to all fields and the speed to match. He has improved his plate discipline significantly in the last year, though he still can get too aggressive and pull-happy at times. After playing left field and batting seventh for the ORGANIZATION in 2014, PERSON has moved to right field and the cleanup spot this spring. He has the pure speed to play center field, but his reads and routes are still rough after he played mostly infield in high school. He's better suited for the corners and has an average arm.",0
"PERSON played a variety of positions at ORGANIZATION, but it was his bat that got him drafted in the third round of the 2014 Draft. PERSON played the outfield, third base and second base during his time with the ORGANIZATION, though he focused on the infield during his pro debut.PERSON has shown signs of being able to hit for both average and power, with the ability to add strength a plus for future development at the plate. PERSON could be an intriguing offensive-minded second baseman, but if the bat comes along as some hope, he might profile better back at the hot corner. He has the hands and arm for third base, and he possesses enough athleticism to handle left field if needed.The PERSON clearly thought PERSON can develop into an everyday bat. They can worry about his ultimate defensive home later on.",1
"PERSON possesses some of the best raw power in the 2015 Draft, though his status is clouded by two factors. First, there are concerns as to whether he'll make enough contact to tap into his home run potential. Second, he barely played this spring after missing the start of the season with an elbow injury and then tearing an GPE tendon in mid-April.A Miami recruit, PERSON hit some of the most impressive home runs on the showcase circuit last summer. He has power to all fields, using the strength and leverage in his big 6-foot-5 frame to smoke line drives that travel great distances. His long arms create a long swing, however, which combined with pitch-recognition issues lead to a lot of swings and misses.While he's a decent athlete for his size, PERSON's below-average speed relegates him to an outfield corner. He throws well enough to handle right field.",0
"It's helpful to use the draft as a way of gauging where pro prospects fall on the ORGANIZATION continuum, and it's easier to do that when the player in question is of the appropriate age. On the brink of 21, PERSON is the age of draftable college players. Coincidentally, this year's draft has a similar type of talent who is similarly aged in GPE shortstop, PERSON. Both PERSON and PERSON are speedy shortstops with rare power for the position who also have issues making contact. PERSON is rangy and athletic, and has good defensive footwork and plenty of arm for the infield's left side. His hands are just okay, so evaluations of his defense can vary depending on what individual scouts think is important to play the position, and some teams want to see him tried in center field. 
PERSON has plus-plus bat speed and his hands work in a tight, lift-friendly circle, but he's so explosive that at times he's out of control (this is where the strikeouts come from). He managed to get to the power at Hi-A in 2018, when he homered 19 times, and if he can stay at shortstop and continue to mash like that in games, he'll be a good everyday player. We have PERSON in the 45 ORGANIZATION tier of the 2019 draft, which puts him in the mid-to-late first round; we like PERSON a bit more than that and think he'd be in the 10-15 range on a draft board. He'll move into the top 100 with continued statistical success at Double-A.",0
"PERSON is a clasic projection case a 6'6/200 with a 90-92 mph fatball that touches 93 and features plus life, an above average slurve and a rarely used changeup that's at least average. In a loaded GPE prep righty class, PERSON is now seen near the top despite the least present stuff of the group because he has clear starter traits and projection.",0
" PERSON, at 6-foot-3 and 175 pounds, has speed in the outfield and projects as a center fielder.Overall, PERSON has been praised for his wiry, projectable body and his above-average athleticism, but there is some concern about his lack of games. There are also some scouts that question his baseball instincts, but he is expected to get better with experience.PERSON has all the tools scouts are looking for and has shown that he can hit in games. His bat is said to be his best tool because he can spray the ball to all fields but he's also a good baserunner. However, PERSON might not be the strongest prospect on the market and his strength could be one area of focus once he signs with a team.",0
"Signed for a Nicaraguan-record $1.35 million bonus in 2009, PERSON looked like a potential star when he hit .328/.381/.485 in his first two months in low Class A as an 18-year-old in 2011. He hasn't been able to recapture that same magic since, though he did make his big league debut at age 22 in July.With his hand-eye coordination and strength, PERSON looks like he should be able to produce for average and power. When he's going well, he employs a short swing, drives the ball from gap to gap and lets home runs come naturally. But he too often gets overaggressive and chases pitches out of the strike zone, resulting in a lot of weak contact.Though PERSON has soft hands and a strong arm, his thick lower half leaves him without much range at third base or speed on the bases. When he and PERSON were together at Double-A last year, PERSON shifted over to first base.",1
"PERSON was one of the three infielders acquired by the Tigers from the D-backs in return for J.D. PERSON in July 2017. Of the trio, it is PERSON who is the only sure-fire shortstop, having long impressed with his stellar glove and arm strength at the position. He made progress at the plate at Double-A in 2018, finishing with a .271 average in his first taste of the level, though the jury is still very much out if he'll ever hit enough to be an everyday player. PERSON is a model defender at shortstop with his cannon arm and slick glove. Though only an average runner, he has plenty of range because he has quick feet and an instinctual first step that consistently puts him in position to make plays. Offensively, the switch-hitter demonstrates a knack for making contact from both sides of the plate, with a more disciplined approach as a lefty. His feel for the barrel produces mostly line drives and ground balls, and it's unlikely that PERSON will ever have enough strength to hit more than the occasional home run.Since power will never be a part of his game, it's crucial that PERSON continues developing as a hitter, with an emphasis on refining his approach and improving the quality of his contact on both sides of the plate. While unlocking PERSON's potential with the bat could push him into consideration as an everyday player, his best fit long-term in the big leagues is as a defensive-minded utilityman who helps wins games with his glove.",0
"The ORGANIZATION scout GPE junior colleges more than most clubs and found PERSON at ORGANIZATION in 2016, when he batted .439/.545/.849 with more homers (20) than strikeouts (18) for the Trojans. Signed for a below-slot $250,000 as a fifth-rounder, he has yet to post big numbers in pro ball but his potential remains evident. He also may be more versatile than expected, getting some exposure to catcher last year and serving as low Class A Quad Cities' regular second baseman during the ORGANIZATION playoffs.A switch-hitter, PERSON has a better swing from the left side but has improved his right-handed stroke. After going homerless in his pro debut, he started incorporating his legs more into his swing and went deep 15 times in 2017. Though he batted just .249 in his first two pro seasons, he has made consistent contact and shown some aptitude for working walks.PERSON has a plus arm and moves well enough to play an average third base. He caught a little at ORGANIZATION and when the ORGANIZATION gave him more time there last year they were impressed at how he naturally shortened his arm action to make quicker throws. His receiving had a long way to go, however, and they decided to focus on developing his bat rather than continuing to use him behind the plate.",1
"Several of the next few hitters on this list are talented, if flawed, corner infield bats. PERSON's flaw is his approach, as he's posting near bottom-of-the-scale walk rates of about 3%. There's little to no recent precedent for a third baseman who is this aggressive having sustained success as a regular unless they have elite bat-to-ball skills, and while PERSON has big time bat speed, he's not a contact savant. He has shown some ability to make mechanical adjustments, though, much to the chagrin of those entertained by his former cut, which looked like a ORGANIZATION comedian was miming a baseball swing. 
PERSON has started to see time at first base and he profiles as a corner bench bat or platoon partner. He's ahead of GPE and PERSON because he's a good deal younger and has the best glove of the three, but if you think handedness is of more significant importance, then you could argue PERSON should be at the back of the group.",0
"An up-and-down senior year of high school caused this ORGANIZATION lefty to slide to the fourth round. PERSON has the chance to be a big-time steal from the 2013 Draft.Some of the southpaw's inconsistencies, particularly in terms of fluctuating velocity, came from a lack of physicality, but PERSON has the frame to add a good amount of weight and strength. That should allow him to have a consistent 90-92 mph fastball in time. PERSON is still throwing a splitter, but the Twins are trying to have him focus on his breaking ball and changeup, both of which have the chance to be at least PERSON average. He has a good feel for pitching and gets high marks for his makeup.PERSON has the body, pitches and command to be a big league starter, one who could jump onto more radar screens in 2014.",1
"Revered as one of the 2014 PERSON's premier athletes, PERSON was set to pursue a career in both baseball and football at ORGANIZATION before the ORGANIZATION offered him nearly $700,000 over slot value as their second-round pick. Although a grim ankle injury prematurely ended his first full season and a broken hamate limited him the following year, a fully healthy PERSON blossomed in 2017, earning PERSON All-Star honors before advancing to the ORGANIZATION. He finished the season with 21 home runs and 27 stolen bases over 122 games between the two levels, and then firmly put himself on the ORGANIZATION radar with a standout campaign in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's breakout caught the attention of the ORGANIZATION, and they acquired him with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON for PERSON in January.PERSON might have the loudest tools in GPE's system. He generates plus raw power to all fields thanks to a combination of physical strength and plus bat speed that enables him to turn around velocity. That power does come with some strikeout concerns, as PERSON's swing will get too long at times and he'll struggle to recognize spin, causing him to expand his zone. PERSON's plus speed makes him a basestealing threat as well as an above-average defender, either in center field or in right, where his cannon for an arm is a clean fit.PERSON offered a taste of his potential during his breakout 2017 campaign, and the ORGANIZATION are justifiably excited about what the future may hold for their new outfielder. If he can stay healthy, PERSON could develop into a perennial 20/20 player who also offers considerable value with his defense.",0
"GPE hasn't developed the control typical of a starter, so while he does has a fairly deep repertoire, he projects in middle relief, where his fastball might tick up beyond where we have it projected.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: St. PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON is committed to GPE Florida State PERSON, although he received interest from multiple high major schools, including PERSON, ORGANIZATION and GPE. The 2017 outfielder has made five All-Tournament Teams since 2013, earned a Most Valuable Player award at the 2013 14U Perfect Game MLK Championship and has captured three ORGANIZATION championships.",0
"PERSON was a two-way prospect in high school, one some teams liked as a left-handed pitcher, who both pitched and hit in his first year at ORGANIZATION. He then focused on being an outfielder and while his junior season wasn't quite as strong as his All-Star turn in the ORGANIZATION League the summer prior, the ORGANIZATION still saw enough to take him in the third round of the 2017 Draft and sign him for a slightly below pick value bonus of $500,000. He struggled in his first full season of pro ball, though he did finish with double digits in home runs and stolen bases.While PERSON doesn't possess any plus tools, he can do a number of things well. He had improved his approach and drew more walks during his junior season and showed some feel to hit along with decent strike zone awareness during his pro debut, though that regressed in 2018. He has good bat speed and considerable raw power to tap into, so the more he can work counts the better he will be at reaching that power. While he profiles more as a tweener, PERSON has mostly manned center field as a pro and has impressed the ORGANIZATION with solid instincts and an average arm.He's likely not a full-time center fielder going forward, but knowing he can handle the position could serve him well as a future fourth outfielder. For him to be an everyday left fielder, he'll have to maximize his hit and power tools from the left side of the plate.",0
"PERSON's development has been a winding road but he's now trending up once again after a 2019 trade from GPE for PERSON. He's age appropriate in Double-A, performing well while striking out a good bit, but his underlying ORGANIZATION numbers suggest he's been unlucky with results, is hitting the ball very hard and is still solid-average in center field.",0
"A talented two-way player from the ORGANIZATION high school ranks, PERSON wanted to hit as a pro. Many teams liked him more as a pitcher, but the ORGANIZATION were more than willing to let him swing the bat. A slow starter in each of his first two full pro seasons, PERSON still mashed his way to Double-A at age 20, collecting 20 or more home runs in each of those years. He capped off 2017 with a strong ORGANIZATION, finishing first in slugging, second in home runs and third in OPS.There has never been any question about PERSON's raw power and earlier questions about his ability to tap into it consistently have thus far been answered. He's become a better overall hitter and is quicker to the ball than when he first entered pro ball. While he'll always rack up strikeouts, he did lower his K rate and improve his walk rate in 2017 while moving up the ladder. PERSON also made huge strides in his defense at third and there are no longer concerns about his ability to stay at the hot corner, where his plus arm has always played well. He runs better than people might think at first glance, and some feel his athleticism would allow him to move to left field if there was a need or someone blocking him in GPE. For now, he'll continue to improve in all facets of the game as a third baseman, where he looks like he'll fit the power-hitting, run-producing profile in the mold of a ORGANIZATION type of player.",1
"PERSON intrigued scouts with a low-90s fastball as a left-handed pitcher, but like a lot of two-way players he preferred to be in the lineup on a daily basis. He worked just 1 2/3 innings on the mound as a LOCATION junior in 2015, instead establishing himself as one of the best college athletes available. After signing for $581,300 as a third-rounder, he rose to low Class A during his pro debut. Another toolsy outfielder in a system loaded with them, PERSON has plus raw power and above-average speed. He has a knack for barreling balls and the patience to draw walks. His left-handed swing can get long and out of control, so he'll have to refine his approach in order to do damage against advanced pitching. Despite his quickness, PERSON doesn't steal a lot of bases and isn't a lock to stay in center field, where he spent the majority of his debut. He also saw action in right field and profiles there with his power and plus arm strength.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON was one of 16 GPE baseball players to attend the ORGANIZATION. He has a side-saddle start in front of the rubber. His delivery is a simple lift and step, with some effort on his release. His control needs work, but the right-hander can get his fastball up to 93 mph and also has a curveball that clocks in at 76-77 mph.",0
"PERSON is an athletic, undersized conversion arm with big time arm-acceleration. His arm action is a little stiff, but itâs fast, and generates a fastball in the 92-96 mph range (mostly 3s and 4s) with riding life. PERSONâs size and the drop and drive nature of his delivery combine to create flat plane that plays well up in the zone. Heâll miss bats at the letters with his heater. Thanks to his athleticism, PERSON repeats, and throws more strikes than is typical for someone fairly new to pitching who has this kind of stuff, with a notable proclivity for locating his fastball to his arm side. 
The slider can slurve out and even get kind of short and cuttery at times, but when it's well-located and PERSON is on top of the ball, itâs a plus pitch. His changeup, which he seldom uses at the moment, is easy to identify out of the hand due to arm deceleration, and is comfortably below average. 
Because of the strike throwing, fastball efficacy, and ability to spin the breaking ball give him a good shot to play a big league role, and we've moved PERSON up beyond where we had him pre-draft. The athleticism, small school pedigree, and position player conversion aspect of the profile indicates thereâs significant potential for growth as PERSON gets on-mound experience. He projects as ORGANIZATION. 4 starter, with a chance to be more because of his late-bloomer qualities.",0
"PERSON sits just 86-89 but his deceptive, funky, over-the-top delivery combined with the extreme length of his stride down the mound make him an uncomfortable at-bat for opposing hitters. If there's an Oliver Drak delivery comp in the minors, it's PERSON, and he can somehow turn over a changeup from this slot. It's hard to say if this sort of deception will hold water at upper levels but PERSON may yet grow into more velocity. ",0
"PERSON got on the national stage hitting 97 mph in the fall before his draft year, but his size kept him from ever being regarded as a premium pitching prospect. He had a tough draft spring, sitting 87-90, leading to signing in the 14th round with PERSON, but was 92-95, touching 98 mph with solid average offspeed in instructional league after signing. He made another jump in 2019, sitting in the mid-90's and hitting 100 mph in short outings.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: St. PERSON MLB Player: PERSON, a GPE Canyon commit, has made four All-Tournament teams since 2014 and plays for the All-Star Baseball Academy on the summer circuit. The catcher participated in the 2016 Area Code Games in GPE and has been invited to numerous Perfect Game events since debuting in the 16U ORGANIZATION Day Classic in 2014. While the catcher currently has a below-average arm, it can get better with added strength. At the plate, he has a medium-length swing and the ability to make line-drive contact.",0
"PERSON was released by the ORGANIZATION in June 2013, just one year after they had signed him out of the ORGANIZATION. He signed with the ORGANIZATION the following month but required surgery in the fall to repair a fracture in his right elbow, costing PERSON all of 2014. He got back on track in the ORGANIZATION League the following year and then broke out in 2016 with a dominant performance between Class A Delmarva and Double-A Bowie. The ORGANIZATION added PERSON to their 40-man roster in November, and he returned to the LOCATION in 2017. PERSON generates easy plus velocity with his lightning-quick arm, sitting at 93-95 mph and touching higher at times. His above-average slider complements his fastball nicely, and the pairing enabled him to rack up 66 strikeouts in 53 total innings last season, during which he held hitters to a .116 average. PERSON also throws a splitter, giving him a chance against left-handed hitters. PERSON's control is below average, especially when it comes to his fastball, though much of that is tied to his inexperience. With improvement on that front, PERSON, whom the ORGANIZATION added to their 40-man roster in November, could reach the big leagues in 2017.",0
"After signing for $170,000 as a GPE shortstop in 2013, PERSON batted .198/.312/.256 in his pro debut before shifting to the mound. He got pounded for a 6.42 ERA in his GPE debut in 2015 but since has developed into one of the ORGANIZATION' best pitching prospects while learning to harness quality stuff. He leapfrogged a few more famous arms in the system to make his big league debut this June, though he went on the disabled list immediately afterward with a strained rotator cuff.PERSON sits at 93-95 mph and tops out at 98 with a fastball that features so much sink that it creates a lot of strikeouts and groundouts, but the life on his heater also makes it difficult for him to command. His hard slider gives him a second plus pitch at times, though he still must improve his changeup to give him a weapon against left-handers. He did make some strides with his changeup late last season.PERSON has a low arm slot and a crossfire delivery that also hamper his ability to throw strikes, and his walk rate jumped from 2.3 per nine innings in high Class A to 6.3 in Double-A. PERSON has moved him from the third-base side of the rubber to the first-base side in an attempt to get him more centered toward the plate. If he ultimately can't develop the control and command to make a big league rotation, he has closer upside if he's moved to the bullpen.",1
"GPE to sign out of GPE in July 2011, PERSON didn't land a pro contract until 15 months later and earned just a $10,000 bonus. He led the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION with a 1.07 ERA in his 2013 pro debut, then did little to distinguish himself until last season, when he reached Double-A and looked like a future No. 3 starter. He entered 2018 as the ORGANIZATION' No. 1 prospect and seemed on the verge of helping the big league club, but he made just eight starts before getting shut down for the season in June with a lat injury.PERSON's stuff improved as he got stronger and starting doing a better job of incorporating his lower half in his delivery. He now deals at 92-96 mph and reaches 98 with his fastball, which has some running life to help keep it off barrels. His curveball isn't as reliable, but it's often a plus pitch with low-80s velocity and good depth.PERSON still is working on his changeup, which has more movement than deception and ultimately can become an average offering. He has pounded the strike zone sine signing and does a good job of avoiding home runs despite being a fly-ball pitcher. GPE loves his makeup and his work ethic should help him reach his potential.",1
" Despite his lack of prototypical size or wow stuff, PERSON banked on his track record of success, as a three-year starter at FACILITY as well as during a turn with PERSON, to become a ORGANIZATION B pick in June.An undersized right-hander, PERSON simply knows how to pitch. He fills up the strike zone with a three-pitch mix. His fastball is average, but he can move it around the zone at will. He has a good feel for his changeup, giving him a second Major League average offering. His breaking ball is fringy, with no power to it to be a true out pitch. PERSON does get high marks for how much he competes and how smart he is on the mound. While he does have a limited ceiling, his pitchabilty gives him the chance to eventually be a No. 4 or 5 type starter, one who may not take that long to be big league ready.",1
"Signed out of GPE in December 2013, PERSON opened eyes with his offensive performance last season as an 18-year-old in the Class A ORGANIZATION. He continued to build on that success with a breakout offensive campaign for Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore in 2016 and even appeared in three games for Triple-A El Paso, during which he collected four hits including a home run.PERSON excels at putting the bat on the ball. He has an advanced understanding of the strike zone and uses a simple right-handed swing to produce line drives. He lacks size and rarely drives the ball, and it remains to be seen if upper-level pitchers will be able to exploit his lack of strength.Though primarily a second baseman, PERSON also has shown the ability to play both shortstop and third base. His speed and arm strength are both average, and he has good defensive actions in the field that could help him carve out a role as utility infielder if he doesn't develop into a regular.",1
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 21, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON Despite standing at just 5-foot-3, PERSON was honored as a 2016 ORGANIZATION and was named to the 17U Olympic National Baseball Team.While his primary position is second base, PERSON has the versatility to contribute in the outfield.PERSON was one of very few freshmen who started for PERSON. The ORGANIZATION talent also participated in the 2016 FACILITY and was a member of the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON was ranked No. 6 on the international prospect list by ORGANIZATION prior to the 2011 signing period and the PERSON signed him for $1.3 million that July. He became a member of the D-backs organization in August 2015 in the PERSON deal.The PERSON sent PERSON to the Class A Advanced PERSON to begin 2015, but he got demoted in early July after struggling. He found his footing back in the ORGANIZATION and hit well in the final month of the season following the trade. While he's still a free swinger who has yet to overly refine his approach, PERSON's swing jumps out. He's direct to the ball and while he lacks plate discipline, he makes solid contact consistently. He hasn't shown much in-game power yet, but there is some raw pop to tap into. PERSON has good actions in the field with a strong arm, but his below-average speed has most believing he won't be a shortstop for much longer.The good news is that with his upside potential offensively, he may not have to be one to profile well. A move to third, or perhaps bouncing around the infield a bit, could be in his future.",1
"  PERSON helped ORGANIZATION win the national championship during his freshman season and then became a first round pick in 2011. He earned all-star honors in each of his first three full professional seasons and his production took a step forward in 2014 in Triple-A and he made his big league debut in 2015.PERSON gets the most out of his tools thanks to his baseball instincts and makeup. He's started driving pitches more consistently, allowing him to better tap into his power. He's an intelligent hitter, capable of using the whole field. Defensively, he covers ground well in center field and has shown the ability to play all three outfield positions capably.Armed with solid tools across the board, PERSON's versatility and work ethic should help him as he attempts to break into the ORGANIZATION outfield picture.",0
"Line up all the teenage arms on the planet and few of them have stuff as hellacious as GPE', who had moments of being a dominant force of nature in last year's ORGANIZATION. At times, GPE would sit 93-96; at others, his fastball would crest 100 and he'd break off the occasional plus-plus breaking ball. He also has long stretches where he's wild, erratic, and visibly flustered on the mound. Thereâs much to be desired from a poise/mound-presence standpoint here, but thatâs okay for now considering his age. He has a deep, plunging arm action similar toÂ that of PERSON andÂ Jonathan Loaisiga, who have each had injury issues (as has GPE), and he might end up a reliever, but we currently have him evaluated the way we would a late first round arm.",0
"PERSON parlayed a strong junior season at ORGANIZATION into an eighth-round selection by the ORGANIZATION in 2014, only to have his pro debut cut short after just a week because of a foot injury. His first full season was interrupted by a separated shoulder in May and another disabled list stint in late August.When healthy, PERSON has shown he is the kind of heady middle infielder the ORGANIZATION thought they were drafting. PERSON makes consistent contact from the left side of the plate, though his well-below-average power makes some wonder about how much he'll hit as he moves up the ladder. He is a solid defender - the ORGANIZATION knew his glove was ahead of his bat when they took him - one who could stay at shortstop long term.PERSON is one of those college performers whose whole is greater than the sum of his parts, one who might be best suited for a utility role when all is said and done.",0
"For the first time in 2018, the ORGANIZATION deployed scouts dedicated to the lowest levels of the minor leagues and it netted them one of the more explosive physical specimens on last year's desert backfields. Traded in a prospect-for-prospect deadline deal that sent one of the ORGANIZATION' many upper-level outfielders, PERSON, to GPE, PERSON dominated rookie ball on either side of the deal and slashed .321/.409/.525 combined in the ORGANIZATION and ORGANIZATION. PERSON like a Division I tight end, PERSON' body is a baseball rarity, and he still has growth potential from both a physical and mechanical perspective. PERSON doesn't always transfer his weight effectively and his swing can be bottom hand-heavy, but it has a workable foundation and he has the requisite bat speed, strength and hand-eye coordination to hit and hit for power. At maturity, he could be a 6-foot-5, 230 pound power-hitting force in the middle of a lineup.",0
"ORGANIZATION PERSON was founded in 2014 in the greater GPE area in the hopes to create a place for high school players to take their games to the next level. It's had four players drafted in the past two years, but only one -- PERSON a fourth-rounder in 2017 -- taken in the top 10 rounds. PERSON left The ORGANIZATION for ORGANIZATION this season and could very well be the next, though a commitment to GPE could stand in the way.Based solely on arm strength, PERSON deserves to be much higher on this list. He's up to 96-97 mph consistently with his fastball and there could be more in the tank with some tweaks to his delivery, though his four-seamer is fairly straight. There's some violence to his delivery, with a short arm action, that impacts his ability to command his heater and his secondary stuff. He throws a power curve which sometimes gets slurvy and morphs into his slider, with some scouts thinking the slider would be a better option given his arm action. He does have a changeup, which can be effective at times, but he never needs to throw it and needs development.Because of his power stuff, delivery and lack of command, some see PERSON as a future reliever, which is a bit of a tough profile for a high schooler. That and what might be a high price tag to keep him from being a ORGANIZATION could send him to college in the fall.",0
"A convert to the mound in 2008, the ORGANIZATION right-hander has taken well to his new craft. He was acquired from the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION deal following a huge 2011 season, his first as a full-time starter. After being a ORGANIZATION State PERSON, earning a promotion to Double-A and winning a spot on the 40-man roster in 2011, GPE's numbers have dipped the past two seasons. He can throw all of his pitches for strikes, and his feel for pitching can allow his stuff to play up. He can run his fastball up to 93 mph, moving it in and out while varying velocity. His changeup has good fade to it, and his breaking stuff is part slider, part curve. But his best secondary offering is his splitter, which is a real swing-and-miss pitch. He was far too hittable in the past couple years, but he still has the chance to be a No. 3-type starter.",0
"When PERSON was coming out of PERSON in 2009, scouts liked his arm strength, his pure stuff and his size, even if his results that year were inconsistent. Since going to the ORGANIZATION in the sandwich round that June, the evaluation might not be all that different, though his stuff hasn't been quite as good. He still has a good fastball, one that has good sink and induces groundballs regularly. He has both a slider and a changeup to back up the heater. While he throws strikes and goes right after hitters, his overall command hasn't improved as a starter, and he did pitch a bit better out of the bullpen in Double-A before pitching in relief in the ORGANIZATION. That's likely to be his future role, especially if he hopes to stick with a team as a Rule 5 selection.",0
"GPE had been an interesting, if not high-profile prospect entering the spring. When he tossed four shutout frames at ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION in GPE, he put himself much more firmly on the map.GPE looks like the quintessential projectable high school right-hander, one who saw an uptick in his velocity this spring and who might have more in the tank. He's been up to 94 mph at times this spring, mostly sitting in the 90-93 mph range. He'll flash a slider that looks like it could be above-average, in the 78-82 mph range, but it often gets caught in between a slider and curve. He'll occasionally show some feel for a changeup, but he doesn't always throw it. The biggest drawback to GPE's profile is his arm action, which creates control problems and scouts don't love and think it makes him lean toward a reliever profile. GPE is committed to PERSON and could head there if the ORGANIZATION doesn't go the way he hopes. A team willing to bet on the upside potential and being able to clean up his delivery could take a chance at signing him away from school in the top six rounds.",0
"GPE has big time pull-side lift in his swing, has 45 raw power already at age 17, and a fairly projectable 6-foot-2 frame that portends more. He'll reach down and barrel balls near his shoe tops and also crush mistakes. He's too aggressive right now and probably has to move to a corner eventually, so our early assessment of the profile is that it's very risky. But as far as teenage power projection bats go, this is a good one.",0
"PERSON doesn't have the size (5-foot-10, 165 pounds), PERSON pedigree (22nd round) or radar-gun readings to stand out as a top prospect. But while he doesn't have a high ceiling, he does have a track record of success in college and pro ball. More of an infielder at ORGANIZATION (GPE) JC, he set single-season (19) and career (27) saves records at ORGANIZATION and recorded a 1.37 ERA in his first two years as a pro before the ORGANIZATION traded him to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON in November.Though PERSON's fastball tops out around 93 mph, it's effective because it features good life and he can locate it on both sides of the plate and down in the strike zone. He has shown the ability to get swings and misses with his curveball (his best offering), slider and changeup, though he'll have to prove that he can continue to do so against more advanced hitters.PERSON adds to his deception by varying his arm slot, and thus far he has confounded left-handed and right-handed hitters alike. His upside is probably no more than a middle reliever, but with his control and mound presence he has a good chance of reaching it.",1
"One of the youngest players in the 2013 GPE (17 years, nine months), PERSON was also one of the youngest in the GPE League when he had a breakout season in 2016. He ranked second in the Class A Advanced circuit in slugging (.533) and third in homers (23) and was one of just three 20-20 players in the ORGANIZATION. He had a solid encore in 2017, homering 18 times while advancing to Double-A, before becoming part of the four-player package the ORGANIZATION sent to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON in January.PERSON's hitting ability stands out more than his pop, as he works counts while using a compact left-handed swing to hit line drives to all fields. He does have at least average raw power and is starting to turn on more pitches, so he could become a 15-homer threat in the big leagues. He has solid speed and is improving as a basestealer.The key for PERSON going forward will be to improve his play in center field because he doesn't profile as a regular on the corners. He needs to upgrade his routes to be more than an average defender in center. He played all three outfield spots in 2016 but right field is a stretch because he has a below-average arm that registered just one assist in 103 games.",1
"PERSON headed to GPE PERSON from GPE, Fla. as a two-way player. When his pitching career fizzled after his freshman year, he focused on his bat and his play at third, and after a strong sophomore season and standout PERSON campaign over the summer, he looked to be an interesting college bat for the 2017 Draft class. Struggles during his junior year led to a slide to the 11th round, which he promptly forgot during his pro debut, when he won the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League batting title.In his brief career, PERSON has shown an innate ability to barrel up the baseball from the right side of the plate with a line drive approach. He can drive the ball to all fields, albeit without over-the-fence power, as he is much more focused on contact. PERSON has the chance to be a plus defender at the hot corner, with good hands, footwork and a strong arm.Without the requisite power, PERSON doesn't currently truly fit the third base profile. If that develops in the future, he could be the kind of run producer teams covet at the hot corner.",0
"GPE picks beyond the ORGANIZATION Round are not allowed to be traded, but international bonus pool slots can be, even once the signing period has begun. That's how PERSON, along with right-hander PERSON, came to the D-backs from the Phillies, as the latter traded up to pick up more money to spend on the international market.A non-drafted free agent out of PERSON and State (after first attending PERSON), PERSON got a shot to start in 2015 after pitching well in relief in the ORGANIZATION right after signing. The D-backs kept him in a rotation once they got him and he opened some more eyes there. The 6-foot-5 lefty has some definite arm strength, sitting 92-95 mph with his fastball. He'll mix in a slurvy breaking ball and a changeup, both of which show glimpses of being serviceable. More than anything, PERSON needs to refine his command, and there's hope his pitches will all get more consistent if he can find the strike zone more consistently.PERSON is definitely a diamond in the rough and a long way away from the big leagues, but with size, arm strength and a three-pitch mix, the D-backs see no reason why he can't keep working out of a rotation.",0
"A fourth round pick by GPE in 2017, PERSON was traded to the ORGANIZATION just over a year after he was drafted. The ORGANIZATION push college pitchers up the minor league ladder very quickly, and they sent PERSON to Double-A immediately after acquiring him. Though he only sits in the low-90s, PERSON's fastball results in uncomfortable swings from opposing hitters because he generates big extension and hides the ball well. He's a low-risk middle relief prospect who should be ready for the majors relatively soon. ",0
"PERSON's well above-average speed led PERSON and PERSON to recruit him as a wide receiver and made him PERSON's top high school prospect in 2015. The ORGANIZATION became smitten with him when he put on a power display during a ORGANIZATION workout and signed him away from a ORGANIZATION commitment for $1.3 million in the fourth round. He has the best all-around tools in the system but didn't display much consistency at the plate in his first three pro seasons.Though he's 5-foot-8 and has a compact left-handed swing, PERSON creates impressive power with bat speed, sneaky strength and the ability to backspin balls. He gets out of rhythm at the plate, however, because he has an unconventional setup with low hands and a high leg kick. PERSON hoped he started to turn a corner when he hit .255/.339/.516 in the final two months of 2017 but he hasn't built on that momentum in his first foray into high Class A.PERSON's wheels make him a basestealing threat, though he needs to refine his technique and get on base more often to take advantage. His speed currently plays better in center field, where he has fine instincts and covers a lot of ground. He has an average arm and keeps runners in check by getting to balls quickly and making accurate throws.",0
"PERSON has a power forward build at 6-foot-8 and is an extreme power projection long shot. Scouts see 65-grade future raw power and a chance to stay in center field, so PERSON may be the heir to the ORGANIZATION young adult son hitting prospect throne.",0
"PERSON was an athletic proejction arm from the LOCATION who signed for $300,000 as an 11th rounder in 2016. He barely pitched in 2017 due to a shoulder issue. He was back on an affiliated mound in May and, though his repertoire is very limited, his stuff is now better than it was in high school. He mixes in a four and two-seamer in the 91-93 range but will touch 96, and he'll show you an above-average slider. Pro scouts have him projected as a two-pitch reliever because that's really all they've seen from him, and PERSON is already 21, but let's see what else materializes as he gets more reps.",0
"  PERSON's first full professional season saw him start the All-Star Game for the GPE League before moving up to Double-A Pensacola for the second half. After his breakout year, the ORGANIZATION traded him to the Phillies in exchange for PERSON. He struggled a bit in his first season with the Phillies but appeared to be bouncing back in year two.None of PERSON's pitches jump off the page, but he does have four of them that he can throw for strikes. His fastball can touch 93-94 mph, and he was hitting that more consistently while regaining command of it in 2016. His slider, also improved, flashes above-average as well. PERSON mixes in his curve and changeup to keep hitters guessing. All of his stuff plays up because of the deception his unusual delivery creates.When with the ORGANIZATION, PERSON was often compared to PERSON for his stuff and deception. It didn't take long for PERSON to get to the big leagues, and PERSON appears to be on that track.",0
" The massive raw tools the ORGANIZATION saw in PERSON when they signed him out of GPE are starting to show up on the field more consistently. The outfielder topped the GPE League in slugging percentage and finished second in ORGANIZATION and ORGANIZATION, showing a fairly advanced approach from the left side of the plate. He's filled out a bit since signing and slowed a step. He can still play center if needed, but he moved to a corner to make room for PERSON's arrival in GPE and that's likely where he'll make his permanent home and be a solid defender. PERSON will be 20 for all of the 2013 season and just getting started in reaching his offensive ceiling.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
" PERSON was unheralded as an amateur in the ORGANIZATION, signing for just $20,000 in 2011. He earns praise for his makeup, and his hard work as a professional has made that seem like quite the bargain, as he set career highs in nearly every offensive category and reached Double-A Corpus Christi in 2014. He found Double-A pitching hard to handle in 2015, however.PERSON stands out for his athleticism and power-speed combination. If he can develop more feel at the plate, he has the potential to become a five-tool player. To do so, he'll need to refine his pitch recognition and cut down on his strikeouts after whiffing in a quarter of his plate appearances during his first two years of full-season ball.PERSON has a strong arm and is a capable center fielder. He is still physically maturing, though, and if he loses a step as he fills out, he could end up in a corner.",1
"A three-year starter at ORGANIZATION, PERSON played second during his freshman year. He's moved over to the left side of the infield to play short the last two seasons, raising his profile in the process. A strong Cape Cod League with the bat has carried over to solid performance on a top-rated team this spring, increasing his ORGANIZATION stock in the process.PERSON has a pretty good track record of performing well for an extended period of time, perhaps saving his best year for the right time in terms of the ORGANIZATION. He can impact the baseball consistently, with an advanced approach at the plate, and while the numbers don't necessarily reflect it, there is some power for him to tap into. PERSON runs fairly well, though he isn't overly fluid in his actions. That leads to some questions about his ability to stay at shortstop, with some seeing a return to second base in his future.College hitters who perform typically move up boards as the ORGANIZATION approaches, and that's exactly what has happened with PERSON. He's like a slightly less fluid version of PERSON, with the potential to be an offensive-minded second baseman at the highest level.",0
"The GPE right-hander struggled with arm trouble in the early stages of his career, but things started to click for him in 2010 as he reached Double-A as a starter. While he did get to Triple-A in the rotation in 2011, his performance was not as consistent, so the ORGANIZATION moved him into the bullpen in 2012. The results were positive as he began the year in Double-A and ended it in GPE. The older brother of ORGANIZATION prospect PERSON, PERSON uses a very good two-pitch power arsenal now that he's in relief. He'll touch 98 mph with his fastball that has some sinking action to it. When he's in sync, delivery-wise, his slider can be above average. He struggled with his command during his big league debut but should get the opportunity to show he belongs full-time.",1
"The ORGANIZATION of GSP has built quite a nice baseball program, producing top prospects like PERSON, PERSON and PERSON. If his first full season is any indication, PERSON, a former PERSON surgery recipient, should join the list of Huskies who are big league bound.The right-handed reliever was tied for second in the Minors with 33 saves in 2013, relying largely on his fastball-curveball combination. PERSON's fastball can touch the mid 90s and his hard breaking ball is a hammer out pitch. He also has a changeup, giving hitters a third look. PERSON is very aggressive on the mound with some effort in his delivery, and he will need to throw more strikes as he moves up the ladder.With his stuff and mindset on the mound, if PERSON can refine his command, he has the chance to continue closing at the highest level.",0
"Not a big name when the summer showcase circuit season began, PERSON had put himself firmly on the map with consistently strong performances across multiple events. He's picked up this spring where he left off, continuing his climb up ORGANIZATION boards to become perhaps the top high school arm in the class.Big, strong and physical, PERSON has seen all of his stuff play up during his senior season. His four-seam fastball continues to touch 97 mph on a regular basis and he's maintained that velocity deep into starts, showing that it wasn't just the shorter stints of the showcase circuit that allowed him air it out. He'll drive the ball down in the zone, but can pitch up and down with his fastball well, with improved overall command of the pitch both in and out of the strike zone. He complements the heater with a plus power curve he can throw for strikes, missing bats consistently. His changeup has also taken a step forward, giving him a third at least above-average pitch.While some scouts don't love PERSON's arm action in the back, it doesn't affect him out front and he's commanded all three of his pitches extremely well, repeating his delivery consistently. He has frontline starter potential, and that should entice enough teams in the first round to keep PERSON from heading to the ORGANIZATION of GPE.",0
"Another product of the ORGANIZATION' extensive international scouting efforts, PERSON signed for $300,000 in January 2013. The son of ex-big leaguer PERSON, PERSON was born in GPE while his dad was a Double-A pitcher there but grew up in the ORGANIZATION. Previously known more for his polish than his power, he added velocity when he made the jump to Class A at age 19 last year.After sitting around 90 mph with good sink on his fastball in 2015, PERSON worked at 91-94 and hit 97 last season. He continued to create groundouts but didn't command his heater as well as he had previously. He has good feel for a tumbling changeup that currently grades better than is slider, with both pitches showing the potential to become at least average.In his first taste of full-season ball, PERSON tired in the second half. Adding strength should help with his durability and his ability to repeat his delivery, which drifted offline from the plate more than usual in 2016. There's still projection remaining in his lean frame, so there could be more velocity to come.",1
" Since signing out of GPE, PERSON has been challenged with assignments that put him way ahead of the curve. In 2012, he was the youngest pitcher in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League and more than held his own. Pitching downhill from his 6-foot-6 frame, PERSON's fastball touches 95 mph and should be a consistently plus pitch. His secondary stuff has the chance to be plus as well, from his hard curve to his changeup. PERSON has a better feel for pitching than most teenagers and he gets high marks for his makekup and mound presence. The combination of size, stuff, pitchability and work ethic all point to the potential as a front-line starter.",0
"PERSON High in GPE has produced four first-round picks in the last two decades: PERSON (1995), PERSON (2000), PERSON (2000) and PERSON (2002). PERSON, PERSON's latest star, might get picked earlier than any of them because he's an offensively gifted catcher with plus arm strength to boot. His standout tool is his right-handed power, which he generates with bat speed and strength. He has enough feel for hitting that he could produce .280 batting averages in the ORGANIZATION. To do that, he'll need to curb a tendency for his swing that gets long at times which causes him to miss hittable fastballs. PERSON's arm gives him a third future plus tool. He moves better than most catchers, though his receiving will need to improve if he's to stick behind the plate. If not, he has enough athleticism and bat to make it as a right fielder. He has committed to GPE.",1
"PERSON is an average middle infield defender with below-average offensive tools. If those grow to average, he could sneak up on us and be an everyday player. If they continue to hang in the 40/45 area, PERSON will be a utility option. ",0
"PERSON signed for $250,000 in 2017 and had a strong summer in the ORGANIZATION, hitting .360/.460/.500 with more walks than strikeouts. Though he also worked out as an infielder as an amateur, PERSON lacked the arm and actions for the dirt and began his pro career in center field. He's a plus runner and though his frame is mature, it's quite compact and he's not likely to get so large that he must move to a corner. His skillset is exactly the kind that often crushes the ORGANIZATION; he's much stronger than most of the league's lanky teens and his speed takes advantage of bad ORGANIZATION defenses. There are big league tools here, they just come with some reasons to doubt the elite-level performance.",0
"After he put it all together during a breakout 2017 -- which included 20 homers and 40 stolen bases, not to mention a GPE League record 39-game hitting streak -- PERSON initially struggled in 2018. A left thumb ligament injury suffered early during Spring Training games when he crashed into the wall trying to make a catch made it tough for him to get on track.Brimming with tools and athleticism, PERSON could play center field in the ORGANIZATION right now. With PERSON departed, there is no center fielder in the system who can get to a fly ball or line drive like PERSON can. And his cannon arm also enables him to be a good right fielder. Offensively, he has well above-average raw power, but he still lacks in pitch selection and discipline while being super-aggressive at the plate, keeping him from tapping into that power consistently. PERSON has been working with him and had PERSON move his hands down on the bat to create more leverage. He possesses great bat speed and can create good backspin on the ball.Now is the time for PERSON to put it all together, especially after seven years in the organization and being 23 years old. On any given day, a scout could give him 70 and 80 grades across the board. But he needs to improve his emotional control and be pushed at times to reach what still appears to be a high ceiling. As one scout said, ""He'll show the tools at 5 o'clock, but will it translate at 7?""",0
" The ORGANIZATION think PERSON may have been one of the most improved players in the system in 2012, lowering his hit and walk rate considerably while finally getting out of GPE, albeit briefly, after spending parts of three seasons there. He has an easy plus fastball, thrown 95-99 mph. Itâs a heavy fastball that gets more groundballs than strikeouts at this point, though he can dial it up to get swings and misses at times. His slider, thrown up to 89 mph, has short, late tilt. Heâll even mix in a sinking changeup on occasion, though as a short reliever, he wonât need it much. He generally throws strikes, though lacks fine command, but again, can thrive without it given his role. If the improvement PERSON showed in 2012 continues, it wonât be long before the âfuture closerâ label appears with his name consistently.",1
"A year ago, PERSON looked like perhaps the best college bat in the ORGANIZATION region for the 2018 GPE, but in May of 2017, a collision with the outfield wall resulted in a serious hip injury that required surgery. He returned in time to play all of his junior year, though his speed was initially hampered. Other college hitters in the area may have passed him, but he was coming on strong as the GPE approached.PERSON has excellent bat to ball skills and makes consistent hard contact. It's more of a line drive approach at present, though the left-handed hitter has some extra-base thump. While he might run into a few homers along the way, he's definitely an average over power kind of hitter. Before the injury, PERSON's athleticism and speed were by far his best tool, with some putting a 70 on his run tool. It's more of a 60 now, though it's trending upward the further removed from surgery he becomes. He's a solid defender in center field with a decent arm.The more PERSON looks like his pre-injury self, the more his name was moving up boards, with some buzz as early as the third round. PERSON thinking about taking him will have to put aside any worries about long-range questions about his health.",0
"A transfer from PERSON (Fla.), PERSON had a so-so debut campaign for GSP in 2015. But he really put himself on the map in 2016, showing the kind of offensive profile that could fit well in an outfield corner at the next level.The right-handed GPE uses a short and handsy swing to consistently make the ball jump off his bat. PERSON doesn't waste a lot of motion and has shown both the ability to hit for average and power, albeit it in a weaker conference. It might be more doubles power at the next level, but PERSON has shown over-the-fence ability is in there. His plus arm also profiles well in right field, where he is a very capable defender.The team that takes PERSON in the top three rounds will be the one that believes PERSON has the tools to be an everyday corner outfielder. At worst, he could be a very productive fourth outfielder at the big league level.",1
"One of the best high school pitching prospects ever to come out of GPE, PERSON missed his entire senior season following PERSON surgery but still got offered $600,000 by the Dodgers after they took him in the 29th round of the 2015 Draft. He contributed to ORGANIZATION's 2016 College World Series championship as a freshman and unquestionably has a first-round arm. Yet he has battled the strike zone throughout three years with the Chanticleers and two summers in the ORGANIZATION, making it unclear how high he'll get picked this June.PERSON has one of the best pure fastballs among college starters, sitting at 92-95 mph and topping out at 97 with sink. In shorter stints on the Cape last summer, he reached 99. His slider combines mid-80s power and late bite, serving as a wipeout pitch at its best, and he can flash a plus changeup with fade as well.PERSON is athletic but has a long arm action in the back of his delivery that hampers him from repeating his release point and keeping his mechanics in sync. He has averaged at least seven walks per nine innings in each of his three college seasons and may never have more than fringy control. He's probably best suited for the bullpen and has the stuff to handle a high-leverage role if he can find the plate.",0
"PERSON was emerging as a top high school prospect in GPE Virginia when he made the move to ORGANIZATION in GPE after his sophomore year. He's taken advantage of the opportunity, showing off premium arm strength against a very high level of competition.PERSON is all about arm strength and a big fastball. He'll sit 92-93 mph consistently and has been up to 95 mph at times. His slider, which has 10-to-4 action with solid bite and depth, gives him a breaking ball that will be at least average. It can get slurvy at times but he has made strides with it this spring. He doesn't use a changeup in games, though some have seen feel for a fringy one in bullpen sessions. The big right-hander has struggled with his command at times, with some feeling his high-tempo delivery and mindset point to a future in the bullpen.If a team thinks he's a starter, he could go in the top five rounds of the ORGANIZATION because of his arm strength. Signing him away from his commitment to LSU might be another variable teams will consider in June.",0
"PERSON turned down the ORGANIZATION as a 39th-round pick out of high school in 2014 to honor his scholarship to PERSON, where he excelled as a both a freshman and sophomore while bouncing between the rotation and bullpen. He garnered All-Star honors as one of the top pitchers in the prestigious Cape Cod League in 2016 and appeared poised to become an early-round Draft pick in '17 before lat and shoulder injuries wiped out most of his junior campaign. He went undrafted that June and transferred to PERSON State Stanislaus, where his dominant campaign (8-1, 1.65 ERA, 127/13 K/BB) earned him a seventh-round selection by the ORGANIZATION in 2018. He's quickly emerged as one of the biggest steals of that class since entering the pro ranks, thanks to an eye-opening first full season in which he was promoted from PERSON to Class A Advanced Charlotte in mid-May. PERSON already featured an 88-93 mph fastball when the ORGANIZATION drafted him, and he's had velocity tick up in his first full season to the point where his heater now ranges from 92-96 mph in most outings. His clean, loose arm action and three-quarters slot give him natural deception that makes his fastball play at a higher effective velocity, and in turn it enables him to pile up whiffs at the top of the strike zone. PERSON flashes above-average potential with his curveball, which he throws with tight, knee-buckling action nearly 20 mph slower than his heater, while his changeup is a distant third pitch that he'll need to develop as he climbs through the Minors. PERSON throws strikes with all three pitches and has impressed scouts with his fastball command as a pro. But as a slender, fast-armed right-hander who lacks an effective third pitch, it's fair to wonder whether PERSON will be able to stick as a starter long term or eventually have to move to a bullpen role, where his stuff would play up in short bursts. He's passed every test so far, though, showing a blend of elite bat-missing ability and good control early in his career.",0
"PERSON didn't play in his first two years of college at ORGANIZATION, then transferred to ORGANIZATION III Methodist (N.C.) and spent his redshirt sophomore season as a catcher. When he moved to the mound in 2012, he led D-III with 12.6 strikeouts per nine innings, prompting the ORGANIZATION to draft him in the 17th round and sign him for $10,000. After starting during his 2013 pro debut, he moved to the bullpen last year and ranked third among PERSON relievers in whiffs per nine (14.0) and fourth in opponent average (.156).PERSON isn't as overpowering as those number might suggest, but he gives hitters fits by changing their eye level. He'll throw his lively low-90s fastball at the top of the strike zone, then drop in a hard curveball at the knees. He also throws a changeup but it's mostly just for show.PERSON uncharacteristically couldn't find the strike zone in the ORGANIZATION last offseason, and he battled his control at times in 2015. He could move quickly if he throws more strikes.",0
"A 17th-round pick out of high school by the GPE, PERSON didn't get much work as a Texas A&M freshman, but he became nearly unhittable coming out of the bullpen as a sophomore last year. He continued to dominate for the first month of his junior season, putting himself in position to be one of the first relievers selected. A dip in velocity caused his stock to drop a bit, with the ORGANIZATION nabbing him in the fifth round. Early in the year, PERSON sat at 94-96 mph and reached 98 with his lively fastball. He worked more at 92-94 mph when he slumped, topping out at 97 on some days and just 92 on others. He had one of the best curveballs in the GPE, a power downer that can climb into the mid 80s, though it too was less sharp in the latter part of the season.PERSON also has a changeup with some sink and deception, but he's likely a reliever long-term because of command and delivery concerns. The ORGANIZATION kept him in the bullpen, and he advanced to full-season ball during his summer debut.",0
"PERSON was the most improved Cape Cod League player from 2016 to 2017, improving his batting line from .229/.301/.321 to .310/.391/.401. He also won the prestigious summer circuit's ORGANIZATION award and established himself as having one of the best combinations of physicality and athleticism among college position players in the 2018 Draft. He and PERSON had a chance to double the number of PERSON hitters ever selected in the first round, following PERSON (1981) and PERSON (2014), though PERSON's up-and-down junior season likely will knock him down to the second.PERSON has exceptional hand-eye coordination, allowing him to repeatedly barrel balls even though he still can get fooled by breaking balls. His left-handed swing presently is geared more to line drives, but his size and strength create plenty of raw power that's more obvious during batting practice than in games. He's a patient hitter who's not afraid to work deep counts and will take walks when he's pitched around.For a 6-foot-4, 220-pounder, PERSON has a surprisingly broad base of tools. He focused on getting in better shape in 2017, improving his speed to above average and looking surprisingly efficient while playing center field on the Cape. He has played mostly first base and right field for the ORGANIZATION, has a solid arm and profiles best at the latter position.",0
"PERSON is a third-generation shortstop from GPE and his familiarity with the game is apparent in his strong natural instincts. PERSON' impressive bat speed and strike zone recognition cause him to stand out as the most advanced hitter in his class. The shortstop is a line-drive hitter now, but his power is expected to increase as he matures and his above-average speed could eventually turn him into a 30-30 player.PERSON' lean frame and natural athleticism project well defensively, too. PERSON is a solid defender now with an arm that flashes plus at times. As he continues to develop, some scouts feel PERSON will turn into a plus defender in the Majors. If he doesn't stick at short, others have suggested that his tools could play in center field if necessary.The Marlins are the favorites to sign PERSON, who trains with his father, PERSON, in GPE.",0
"Slowed by biceps tendinitis in the spring, PERSON's stuff was fine when he returned. He was touching 99 while throwing live BP, and sitting 92-96 during his starts in extended spring training. His 13-start Northwest/Sally League tour, during which he walked just 19 in 54 innings, was the first step toward quelling concerns about his viability as a starter, though we're still somewhat apprehensive here at ORGANIZATION. 
PERSON's repertoire depth is not the issue. Based on his pitch usage during instructional league, his changeup seemed to be a developmental priority, and he has indeed made progress with it. It now comfortably projects to average, while PERSON's fastball/breaking ball combination has been excellent since he was a high school underclassman.  He incorporates all kinds of crafty veteran wrinkles into his delivery's cadence on occassion. An extra shoulder wiggle, a GPE gyration of the hips, the occasional quick-pitch -- all sorts of things designed to take hitters by surprise. PERSON often sentence quirky, visibly fiery and emotional hurlers to late-inning duty, and we do think PERSON would thrive in such a role, but view these traits as positives. PERSON has a unique build and delivery, and is a very short strider whose 5-foot-4 extension sucks some of the perceived velo out of his fastball. This, plus the lower slot, might make him unusually vulnerable to lefties despite his velocity. This, his brief injury history, and still fringy command all contribute to a bundle of relief risk in our opinion.",0
"A teammate of PERSON at the GPE Baseball Academy, PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION for $984,700 as a supplemental first-round pick in 2012, the same year that the ORGANIZATION made Correa the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall choice. After a slow start to his pro career, PERSON settled in nicely this year in low Class A after moving to second base. The ORGANIZATION acquired him in August as the first of two players to be named in exchange for PERSON Hernandez.The son of 16-year big league shortstop PERSON, PERSON developed tremendous instincts while growing up around the game. A natural right-handed hitter, he began switch-hitting late in his high school career. PERSON won't be much of a power threat, but he controls the strike zone well, and he could develop into a ORGANIZATION. 2 hitter.PERSON has solid arm strength, but his fringy speed and quickness make him a better fit at second base than as a shortstop. If he doesn't hit enough to become a regular, he's capable of playing on the left side of the infield and serving as a utility man.",1
"PERSON is one of the many high-ceiling prep pitchers the ORGANIZATION grabbed in recent Drafts. His early results weren't indicative of his talents, but his tools started to line up with his performance in 2014, as he reached Double-A PERSON as a 21-year-old. After that successful season, he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION as a part of the three-team trade that sent PERSON Myers from the ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION.PERSON throws his fastball, which regularly hits the mid 90s, from a good downhill angle, creating lots of ground balls. His power slider gives him a second above-average pitch, but the development of his changeup will be critical to his future. PERSON' older brother PERSON has pitched in the ORGANIZATION for the past five years. Though it might still be a couple years before PERSON is ready to join him in the big leagues, he has the potential to be a solid starter in time.",1
"On July 12, 2015, PERSON represented the ORGANIZATION, the team that signed him out of the GPE in 2011, in the ORGANIZATION, pitching a perfect inning and striking out two. Less than three weeks later, he was on his way to the ORGANIZATION organization as part of the PERSON trade.PERSON didn't have to go far, traveling from GPE to GPE in the ORGANIZATION State League and bringing his big stuff with him. The 6-foot-4 lefty is all about power with a fastball that sits in the low-90s and has good sink to it when he's throwing downhill. His slider shows glimpses of being above-average and while his changeup needs work, he has enough feel for it to become a Major League average pitch in the future. ORGANIZATION remains the southpaw's biggest problem as he's walked more than 4.5 per nine in his ORGANIZATION career.PERSON has shown glimpses of putting it all together and commanding his three-pitch mix and since he'll be just 22 for all of 2016, so the inclination was to let him keep starting. With his command not improving, the ORGANIZATION moved him to the bullpen in June, where he has the chance to be a power lefty reliever.",1
"A seventh-round pick by the ORGANIZATION out of a GPE high school in 2010, PERSON opted to attend PERSON instead. He ranked seventh in ORGANIZATION Division I with 11.0 strikeouts per nine innings in 2013 -- one spot ahead of GPE. 1 overall pick PERSON -- but PERSON lasted until the fourth round because scouts were concerned that his over-reliance on his slider had sapped his velocity.PERSON's slider still is his best pitch, a mid-80s breaker with a lot of bite. The ORGANIZATION are calling for his slider a lot less than PERSON did, and his fastball has perked up. He's working in the low 90s with good sink that induces a lot of groundouts.The brother of ORGANIZATION third-base prospect PERSON, PERSON has a rudimentary changeup. He shows the control and command to remain in the rotation, though some scouts worry that his crossfire delivery puts too much stress on his shoulder and believe he'd last longer as a sinker/slider reliever.",0
"GPE saw his ORGANIZATION stock begin to take off during his sophomore season at ORGANIZATION, when he took over as the team's everyday catcher at midseason. He improved it even more as a junior this past spring when he was one of three finalists for the PERSON, presented annually to the nation's top amateur catcher, and paced PERSON in on-base percentage while also finishing second on the team in hitting. That improvement at the plate, along with his well-known defensive prowess behind it, earned GPE a $300,000 bonus as the ORGANIZATION' third-round pick. PERSON sent GPE to GPE in return for $1 million in international bonus pool money in December.Regarded by scouts as one of the better defensive catchers in his class, GPE is a true leader behind the dish, one who already knows how to slow down the game and handle a pitching staff. His plus arm is a weapon and helped him nab 60 percent of attempted basestealers as the starter for the ORGANIZATION, and he also receives high marks or his receiving and blocking. That combination could make GPE at least an above-average defensive catcher at maturity.At the plate, GPE has exhibited strong on-base skills and a mature, patient approach, as well as good feel for the barrel and some power potential from the right side of the plate, though that wasn't as evident during his pro debut. While there's plenty to like about his bat, it's his defense that will enable him to carve out a career as a big league catcher.",0
" The ORGANIZATION took PERSON out of GPE State with the hopes he'd be one of those advanced college lefties who could fly through their system. He hasn't disappointed on that front, reaching Triple-A in his first full season. He's not going to wow you with pure stuff and there isn't a ton of projection there, but he has an advanced feel and four pitches to work with. He pitches to contact, and can work his average fastball to both sides of the plate. His slider is the better of his two breaking balls, with late downward tilt and bite. His above-average changeup is plus at times, with good fade. His ceiling is somewhat limited, but he's not far from being ready to step in as a middle-of-the-rotation type in the big leagues.",0
"PERSON was one of the youngest players in the 2012 Draft class and perhaps its best athlete. He was certainly its fastest member and some scouts even believe his speed is comparable to fellow ORGANIZATION native PERSON Hamilton.PERSON' speed is truly elite, but he is more than a track star. If he can refine his aggressive approach at the plate, he has the tools to be a solid all-around hitter. He even has the raw strength to eventually hit for some power. Thanks to his speed, he covers a lot of ground in center field and should be an above-average defender in time.While PERSON remains raw and needs to refine nearly every aspect of his game, he is one of the system's most exciting players.",0
"PERSON is one of the hardest throwing high school pitchers in the 2014 Draft class, but he was dealt a significant setback this spring. He suffered an elbow injury that has kept him off the mound since PERSON, leaving his future uncertain.When healthy, PERSON throws his fastball from 91-95 mph, topping out at 97 mph. He doesn't have a physical frame, instead generating his velocity with athleticism and arm speed. There is some effort to his delivery, and the rest of his game may remain inconsistent until he refines it.His mid-70s curveball will range from a below-average to an above-average pitch, and his changeup shows flashes of becoming an effective offering, but he'll need to throw it more often. PERSON, who plays with his twin brother at PERSON, is committed to GPE.",1
"PERSON was a well-known name to scouts years before he was drafted because as an underclassman, he was great at ORGANIZATION's Tournament of PERSON. That put PERSON (as well as PERSON and PERSON) much further ahead of the notoriety/perceived polish curve than is typical for cold weather hitters. PERSON isn't physically projectable and doesn't have big raw power, so he isn't the sexy upside high school player to whom clubs are drawn, but he does have a long track record of hitting and showing plus defensive ability in center field. He's a plus runner with a plus arm (90-92 on the mound) and gets great jumps on fly balls. There's a real chance PERSON could have four tools that grade out as a 60, along with power that's a 45 or 50, and he's much closer to hitting that upside than most 19-year-olds.",0
"PERSON PERSON was a ORGANIZATION fourth-round pick out of a Mississippi high school in 1983 before playing 14 seasons in the big leagues. His son Ke'Bryan resembles his father as a player and figures to go a couple of rounds earlier in the Draft.PERSON is an advanced high school hitter who doesn't try to do too much at the plate. He utilizes an effortless right-handed stroke and focuses on hitting line drives from gap to gap. He can turn on pitches when opponents challenge him inside and should develop average power.He lacks speed on the bases and first-step quickness, but PERSON has worked hard to get into better shape and improve as a defender. He has good instincts, soft hands and a strong arm that should allow him to remain at third base. Though he has committed to GPE, he's one of the more signable top prospects in the GPE high school crop.",0
"Ever since PERSON was drafted by the ORGANIZATION in the second round out of ORGANIZATION State Fullerton in 2016, there's been a waiting game to see how his fringy stuff/plus command combination would falter as he moved up the ladder. A funny thing happened on the way to his predicted failure: He stumbled in his first year with the Phillies after coming over in the ORGANIZATION deal, but then he adjusted and dominated two levels in 2017, leaving him knocking on the big league door.Despite that fringe-average stuff, PERSON still managed to finish fourth in the system in ORGANIZATION in 2017 while amassing 150 innings along the way. His fastball typically scrapes 90 mph, though he can reach back for a 92-93 mph on occasion. He's tightened up his slider some so it approaches average and he throws his fringy curveball and solid average changeup at will at any point in the count. No one throws more strikes than PERSON, with a career 1.6 walks-per-nine rate that was lowered thanks to his 1.1 BB/9 in 2017.There might not be another pitcher in baseball who does it quite the way PERSON does. He puts all of his stuff in a bowl, mixes it up and it somehow comes out above-average. It's just about time to get him to the big leagues and see if it's for real.",0
"PERSON was a high profile athlete when he arrived on campus at GPE, and some scouts pegged him as the type who would go from a sub-$500,000 player in high school (basically, a talented lottery ticket) to a top two rounds guy in college, and that's exactly what happened. PERSON took PERSON in the first round when he was a plus runner with average raw power, had a good chance to stick at shortstop, and demonstrated surging contact skills. The more pessimistic projections about PERSON's bat ended up being more accurate -- the speed, defense, and raw tools have held steady while he has struggled against pro pitching. In 2018, he repeated Double-A at age 23 and finally hit well, but now will jump two levels to the big leagues as the top pick in the Rule 5 Draft. Offensive expectations are low, in part because PERSON has never been able to tap into his raw power in games, but also because he has needed to repeat levels to find success. That said, some clubs see these raw tools as rare even at the big league level and think there's some low-end regular upside still here with the right coaching.",0
PERSON was eligible last year but some scouts worried about his durability. This year he's improved his command and the stuff is flashing above average with no durability issues.,0
"Few players in the ORGANIZATION' system had their stock improve in 2016 as much as PERSON, whom the club signed as a catcher out of the ORGANIZATION in January 2012. PERSON, in his age-21 season, hit for both average and power in the Class A ORGANIZATION, and he did so while playing more games at third base than ever before. That success followed PERSON up to the Class A Advanced PERSON in 2017, when he finished third in the circuit in hits (131), total bases (198) and doubles (29).The ORGANIZATION view the switch-hitting PERSON as one of the better pure hitters in the system. He has a discerning eye and a knack for making hard contact from both sides of the plate, though much of his power comes as a left-handed hitter. Prior to his impressive 2017 campaign in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON finished third in the ORGANIZATION in total bases (213), and 53 of his 130 hits went for extra bases (35 doubles, six triples, 12 home runs). And while he may be short and stocky, PERSON is a good athlete who moves well for his size.Defensively, PERSON continues to see some work at third base, though the bulk of his playing time continues to be a first base, where he's an average defender. The ORGANIZATION increased PERSON's versatility even more in 2017, offering him reps behind the plate and in the outfield in addition to his usual work at both infield corners. That versatility will be key for the ORGANIZATION in getting PERSON's bat to the ORGANIZATION.",0
"How much do the ORGANIZATION believe in PERSON? In GPE, managing general partner PERSON labeled him untouchable in trade talks, lumping him in with much more famous prospects PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON. Two months later, after PERSON recorded 11 straight scoreless outings in the big leagues, GPE added him to its PERSON Game roster.Not bad for a 13th-round pick in 2012 who signed for $100,000 out of GPE. PERSON has an unorthodox delivery that adds life and deception to his pitches, making him tough to hit when he throws strikes. His main weapons are a 92-97 mph fastball and a low-80s slider, and he'll also mix in a changeup to keep hitters off balance.PERSON has breezed through his first four years of pro ball, posting a 2.23 ERA and allowing just four homers in 184 1/3 innings. If he can reduce his occasional control lapses and stay healthy -- he missed time at the start of the 2013 and 2015 seasons with shoulder issues -- he shows the potential to be more than just a situational lefty.",1
"The son of former All-Star pitcher PERSON and younger brother of GPE infielder PERSON, PERSON was the first high school position player to be taken in the 2014 Draft, and he signed quickly for pick value, $3,851,000.A former two-way player with a low-90s fastball on the mound, PERSON focused on his middle-infield play as a senior, and the work paid off. He has always had the actions and arm to stick at shortstop, and his plus speed plays well on the bases. He has a solid left-handed swing and uses the whole field to hit. He showed the ability to add some strength this spring and will continue to need to add more muscle as he moves up the professional ranks.A rare high school shortstop who will no doubt stay there, PERSON has the chance to one day become an elite-level talent at the premium position.",0
"A supplemental first-round pick in 2011, PERSON dominated lower-level hitters in his first two full pro seasons and looked like he'd become the ORGANIZATION' next homegrown frontline starter. His inability to harness his stuff began to catch up to him in Double-A in 2014, however, and repeated difficulties last year prompted his move to the bullpen last July. PERSON returned to the rotation this year in his third stint in Double-A but pitched worse than ever.PERSON still has his trademark fastball that runs from 92-99 mph, and he can get swings and misses at the low end of that range with heavy sink and at the high end with sheer velocity. He hasn't shown much feel for his secondary pitches, the best of which is a slider/cutter that stands out more for its upper-80s velocity than its bite.San PERSON hasn't made a final decision as to whether PERSON will be a starter or reliever in the long turn. The bullpen seems to be the more likely destination because high pitch counts won't matter in shorter stints and he won't need to use his fringy curveball and changeup as much. But if he can't develop some semblance of control or command, he won't have a role in the big leagues.",0
"PERSON was the top prep prospect in PERSON in 2016, but a disappointing spring and a college commitment to the in-state ORGANIZATION left him undrafted. He has performed steadily since moving into PERSON's rotation as a sophomore and allowed two earned runs or less in his six of his eight Big Ten Conference starts this spring. He should join teammate PERSON to give the ORGANIZATION two pitchers taken in the top five rounds of the same Draft for the first time since 1994 (PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in the third round, PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in the fifth).PERSON owns one of the livelier fastballs in the college ranks, usually operating at 91-94 mph, topping out at 96 and holding his velocity deep into games. Its running and sinking action mirrors that of his solid changeup, which he sells well and has good separation from his heater. His slider ranges from 81-86 mph and can be an above-average pitch at times, though it lacks the consistency of his other two offerings.While PERSON has some effort in his delivery, he repeats it well and doesn't have any difficulty throwing strikes. He has a relatively high floor as a three-pitch starter with a track record of performance. His ability to generate ground balls will make him useful as a reliever if he can't cut it in a pro rotation.",0
"PERSON tied a GPE high school record with 25 homers in 2011 before attending ORGANIZATION, where he played three positions in three years. After moving from third base to catcher to shortstop, he signed for $200,000 as a sixth-rounder in 2014 and played all three positions (as well as second base) in his pro debut. The ORGANIZATION made PERSON a full-time catcher and will keep him there going forward. There's no doubt that PERSON has the tools and the makeup to stick behind the plate. He has a strong arm and has worked to streamline his release, which helped him throw out 34 percent of basestealers in 2015. PERSON has sure hands and also has made progress improving his receiving and blocking skills.PERSON wore down physically and his offense suffered as a result during his lone season as a college catcher, but he managed the workload better last year. He makes consistent contact and has power in his compact right-handed stroke, but he won't be productive at the plate until he implements a more disciplined approach.",0
"Acquired as part of the return from PERSON for PERSON, PERSON has a near-ready relief profile that might yield multi-inning value because of the depth of his repertoire. He brings 95-98 mph heat from the left side and complements it with a bevy of inconsistent secondary offerings. Opinions vary scout to scout as to which of PERSON's other pitches is best. The changeup has the best movement but PERSON struggles to set it up because he can't locate his fastball consistently. His slider is short and cuttery, the curveball has depth but lacks bite. Taken together, they could be enough to flummox hitters one time through the order, but probably not several times.",1
"PERSON didn't reach a full-season league until 2013, his fifth year as a professional, and hasn't had much success. Yet the ORGANIZATION believe his slow progress and so-so stats belie the life in his right arm and the projection remaining in his skinny 6-foot-5 frame. Unfortunately for him, he blew out his elbow three starts into the 2014 season, had PERSON surgery and won't return to the mound until mid-2015.PERSON's best pitch is a 92-94 mph fastball, and while it doesn't have a lot of life, he does a good job of using his height to leverage it down in the strike zone and get groundouts. He could throw harder as his body physically matures, though his fastball already qualifies as a plus pitch.To make it as a starter, PERSON will have to improve the rest of his repertoire, as well as his control and command. He'll flash some solid curveballs but his changeup is little more than a batting-practice fastball. He falls behind in counts to often, allowing hitters to sit on his heater.",0
"A talented enigma at GPE, PERSON's prodigious stuff was finally deployed with some consistency in 2017 as he struck out a whopping 191 hitters in 141.1 innings. His fastball and curveball are both plus while his changeup, slider and command remain fringey, but fringe command is still more than a grade better than what PERSON showed in college. He's progressing but remains a volatile prospect with #2/3 starter potential",0
"PERSON is the best prospect to come out of ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, Ga.), which has produced big leaguers PERSON and PERSON, and 2010 first-rounder PERSON. PERSON' speed and athleticism compare favorably to any of the top prep talents in the 2019 Draft, and he's also one of the better high school hitters available. He draws comparisons to PERSON, though he has considerably more pop than the former batting and stolen-base champ.PERSON has game-changing speed, uses his quickness to beat out bunts and grounders and has the instincts to develop into a premium basestealer. PERSON's 2019 GPE high school player of the year, he has a quick left-handed stroke and controls the bat very well, making consistent contact and using the entire field. While he won't be a slugger, he has looked a little more physical this spring and has the bat speed and deceptive strength to hit 10-15 homers on an annual basis.The biggest question with PERSON is where he'll eventually make his defensive home. The ORGANIZATION recruit has solid arm strength and a chance to stick at shortstop, but he doesn't have the most fluid actions. He might fit better at second base or center field, and he played the latter position in deference to PERSON Jr. on PERSON at the 18-and-under PERSON in GPE last fall.",0
" The ORGANIZATION went over-slot to sign GPE, a GPE high school standout, away from the ORGANIZATION of GPE and they hoped they were getting an athletic switch-hitter who could develop the skills to stay behind the plate. Though he started slowly during his full-season debut in 2012, there was definite progress made. He can swing the bat well from both sides and his overall approach is solid, though he needs to tone down his aggressiveness and find a consistent rhythm at the plate. He should have some power â itâs mostly to the pull side right now â and he does make hard contact. His overall defensive game needs work, as expected, but he does have a solid arm and the athleticism that allows him to be an average runner should help him move behind the plate as he continues to learn the nuances of catching.",1
"PERSON began 2016 as the ORGANIZATION' top-rated prospect, but he wasn't even the best shortstop prospect in the system by the end of the year. After arriving from the ORGANIZATION via the ORGANIZATION Chapman trade, PERSON not only supplanted him but also pushed him to second base at ORGANIZATION A Advanced GPE. PERSON started to get back on track in 2017 with a return to GPE and then looked like his old self after a promotion to Double-A PERSON, where he was hitting .300/.381/.525 when the ORGANIZATION dealt him to GPE as part of the ORGANIZATION blockbuster for PERSON Gray.One of the fastest runners in baseball, PERSON has top-of-the-scale speed and led the Minors with 82 steals in 2015 before dipping to 36 last season. He can get from the right side of the plate to first base in less than 4.0 seconds and wreak havoc once he gets on base. His quickness also should boost his on-base ability, though he'll need to tighten his plate discipline to become a quality leadoff man.While his speed gets the most attention, PERSON has a nice array of tools. His deceptive strength gives him solid raw power and he has an offensive ceiling of a .275 hitter with 15 homers per season. Few players can match his combination of quickness and arm strength, though he has been erratic at shortstop. Some scouts believe he'll wind up at second base or in center field, where he saw increased playing time in 2017.",0
"There's raw power and there's in-game power. Many a prospect over time has the former, but never can find a way to tap into it to have the latter consistently. While there is a lot of swing and miss to GPE's game, he's shown that he can hit the ball out, with 51 homers over his first two full years of pro ball. It's that power the ORGANIZATION wanted when they acquired him last fall from the D-backs in return for catcher PERSON Herrmann.GPE's power comes more from strength than bat speed and he's always going to strike out a lot. While he'll draw some walks, he'll never hit for a high average. He played both the outfield and first base in the D-backs system and the ORGANIZATION plan to let him play mostly in the outfield moving forward, though they won't abandon first base entirely. He'll mostly play the corners, but might see some time in center as well. GPE runs well for someone his size, stealing 24 bases in 2015.The upper levels should be a good challenge for GPE to see if the power will keep showing up against better pitching. If it keeps coming, his left-handed power bat could be of value, at least off of a big league bench.",0
"Looking for a high-risk, high-reward proposition? Then PERSON, the tall lefty from southern GPE, just might fit the bill. The 6-foot-6 southpaw is all projection at this point, though he's shown glimpses of what might be in there. At an early event run by ORGANIZATION scouts, PERSON was 92-93 mph with his fastball, commanding it to both sides of the plate while throwing downhill effectively. He hasn't repeated that, sitting more in the 88-90 mph range with his fastball, with a good feel for the strike zone. His breaking ball has improved, though it comes and goes, sometimes looking like a potential out pitch and sometimes looking like a below-average slow rolling curve.Some feel three years at ORGANIZATION would do PERSON some good for him to hone his craft and add strength, while others feel he could mature in a pro environment slowly just as well. A team that has seen him throw well and is willing to be patient in unlocking the potential might roll the dice early in the GPE.",0
"Another exciting arm talent who cannot stay healthy, PERSON has thrown just 20 innings in parts of three pro seasons. His injury issues date back to his college days at ORGANIZATION when he had shoulder trouble that the coaching staff initially said was hamstring tightness. An excellent on-mound athlete with advanced command, PERSON was 91-93 the summer after he signed, then 92-95 with a reshaped array of secondary offerings the following spring. He looked likely to be a quick-mover, someone who might reach Double-A in his first full season. PERSON, his ORGANIZATION did not cooperate and PERSON had PERSON a week after PERSON did. PERSON returned during 2018 extended spring training and his velocity had totally returned. He was 92-93 early in rehab outings, then 91-95 in his first official ORGANIZATION game back from surgery, but it would be his last in-game outing of the summer as he was shelved for the remainder of the regular season by a setback. 
ORGANIZATION has surgical command of a low-90s heater and plus power changeup. So firm is PERSON' cambio that ORGANIZATION units often mistakenly classify it as a sinker as it resides in the mid-to-upper 80s. It bottoms out late and hard, and is PERSON' best secondary pitch. His breaking stuff has evolved since college and at last look, he was throwing a fringy curveball that is effective because of his ability to locate it, and an average upper-80s cutter. He's a potential fourth starter with a value-altering injury history.",0
" It took a while for him to break through, but 2012 might be the year the ORGANIZATION look back and say was when PERSON became legit. PERSON moved slowly through the system, including parts of two seasons with GPE in the ORGANIZATION, before advancing up to ORGANIZATION in 2012. He's played all over the field and looked a bit like an organizational filler type, but really took off, settled in as a regular shortstop and finished second in the organization in hits. PERSON has the chance to be a solid Major League hitter, one who has a line-drive swing from both sides of the plate. There's some extra-base pop to come as well, though power isn't likely to be a huge part of his game. His speed and his defense will be, however. A plus runner, he's still learning how to use that to his advantage on the basepaths and it helps give him outstanding range. He has great hands and a plus arm, giving him every opportunity to be an everyday shortstop at the big league level.",1
"PERSON won 13 games and struck out 138 batters as a sophomore in 2015, setting GPE school records and leading all ORGANIZATION Division I pitchers returning to college in 2016. He had first-round aspirations entering the year but had an up-and-down junior season before finishing with a 16-strikeout complete game in the Big Ten Conference tournament. He fell to the ORGANIZATION in the fifth round but landed an above-slot $637,500 bonus.The PERSON' career leader in wins (30) and strikeouts (307), PERSON works from a low three-quarters slot that adds life to his pitches, all of which have the potential to be at least solid. His fastball usually runs from 90-94 mph with sink, though his velocity was down to 86-88 at times early in the college season. His sweeping slider can get swings and misses from both lefties and righties, and he shows some feel for a fading changeup.PERSON has a strong, durable build that lets him maintain his stuff over the course of a game and a season. He fills the strike zone, too, though some scouts wonder if he might be better suited as a reliever because of his arm angle. In shorter stints, he might have two plus offerings with his fastball and slider.",0
"Most teams didn't evaluate PERSON as a first-round talent in the 2013 Draft, but the ORGANIZATION loved his bat, so they drafted him 25th overall and paid him a $1,866,500 bonus. He has justified their faith, winning the Rookie-level PERSON MVP award in his pro debut and finishing second in the short-season LOCATION in hitting (.333) in 2014. Last year he skipped a level to high Class A and batted .304 at age 20.PERSON is an extremely advanced hitter for his age, with outstanding hand-eye coordination that allows him to barrel balls repeatedly. He almost does so too easily, making so much hard contact that it cuts into his walk totals. Being more selective also would help his power totals, as he has the bat speed to produce 15 homers per season if he waits for pitches he can drive.PERSON has sure hands and solid arm strength at shortstop, but his fringy speed and range likely will lead to a position change down the line. PERSON thinks he's an underrated defender but also has PERSON at shortstop and PERSON at second base in the big leagues. PERSON might profile best at third base and also could wind up on an outfield corner.",1
" PERSON was a rotation mate of PERSON at the ORGANIZATION of GPE. And while he lacks his former teammate's upside, PERSON pitched well in 2012, his first full professional season. He is an intelligent pitcher and mixes his four pitches well. PERSON's stuff is average. His fastball sits in the upper-80s with sinking action. His best secondary pitch is his changeup. PERSON's success is based on his control, which is among the best in the ORGANIZATION system. He will need to continue to paint corners as he moves to higher levels of the ORGANIZATION.",0
"Coming off a strong sophomore year at ORGANIZATION and with PERSON, PERSON looked like a mid-first-round pick entering 2014. His stuff wasn't as sharp last spring, but his pitchability and track record of success still led the ORGANIZATION to make him their top choice (27th overall) and sign him for $1,843,000.Though he has hit 97 mph in the past, PERSON usually works at 91-93 with his fastball. He commands it well and imparts good sink on it, but his best pitch is clearly his changeup, which is deceptive and features even more life. He has yet to show much aptitude for spinning a breaking ball, and there's some thought that he might be better off trading in his slider for a cutter.PERSON's feel for pitching, his competitiveness and his makeup all earn high praise. If he regains his previous velocity and makes progress with his breaking ball, he could be a No. 3 starter. If not, he still could crack the back of a big league rotation.",1
"Coming off of a strong showing in the 2015 Cape Cod League, PERSON excelled as GPE's Friday night starter last spring and was lauded as one of the more consistent college pitchers on the LOCATION. He signed for slot value in June as the ORGANIZATION' fourth-round pick, impressed club officials while reaching PERSON in his pro debut and then emerged as one of the ORGANIZATION's top breakout hurlers in 2017 with another dominant performance across multiple levels.PERSON' lightning-quick arm produces a 92-95 mph fastball that he uses to attack hitters on both sides of the plate. His secondary stuff isn't quite as good, but his hard slider can be an out pitch at times, and he'll mix in an average curve and a changeup for which he has decent feel.There's some concern after the GPE that PERSON' arm was too quick and that effort in his delivery could mean a move to a bullpen, but he's shown the ability to maintain velocity deep into starts with above-average control, all while missing plenty of bats and generating more than enough ground-ball outs. Now a year removed from the GPE, there's little doubt that PERSON has what it takes to be a quality big league starter.",1
" The 2012 Draft class wasn't a great one in terms of catching depth, especially from the college ranks, so ORGANIZATION was able to ride a strong junior season at ORGANIZATION into the supplemental first round. At ORGANIZATION, he was a contact-first, offensive-minded catcher, but he has some obvious strength and should hit for more power in the future (he did hit seven homers, including four at home in GPE -- a tough park for hitters). He may not wow anyone with his skills behind the plate, but he's a solid receiver who works well with pitchers and with an arm that was strong and accurate enough to throw out 32 percent of would-be basestealers during his pro debut. There isn't much catching depth in the ORGANIZATION' system and ORGANIZATION rises right to the top of that class.",1
" The ORGANIZATION selected PERSON in the fifth round last June and were to set to sign him to a well-above-slot bonus until their agreement with ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick PERSON fell apart. PERSON filed a grievance and ultimately settled with the ORGANIZATION before the matter went to a hearing. He had been committed to ORGANIZATION, but instead of playing for any college this season, he joined ORGANIZATION's post-graduate team.PERSON got off to a strong start, showing the same kind of stuff that initially piqued scouts' interest. His fastball gets up to 95 mph and consistently sits in the low 90s. He's improved his breaking ball, making it more of a curveball, but it and his changeup remain inconsistent. He's also made strides with his delivery, but still struggles at times to find his release point.PERSON has some rough edges that will have to be refined in the ORGANIZATION, but he has the upside to become a big league starter. He earns praise for his makeup.",1
"PERSON had a strong start to his 2018 season before he was shut down in July with a shoulder issue. He didn't pitch for the rest of the summer. PERSON touches 95 and will show you an above-average slider and average changeup. He sat 86-90 as a rising high school senior but has since altered the timing of his arm swing for the better, and the resulting velo is fairly new. Because his delivery is somewhat grotesque and PERSON has now had a shoulder problem, there's apprehension about his health. He was breaking out, then just broke, so now we're in wait-and-see mode regarding his stuff.",0
"PERSON was a 45 FV on last year's ranking, evaluated as an MLB-ready utility infielder or low-end regular at shortstop. During the offseason he was shot in the hip during a robbery in GPE and required surgery. The initial surgery was botched and PERSON needed a second operation during the summer, which ended his regular season. When he returned to action in the ORGANIZATION, he had clearly lost a step overall, but it was most obvious when watching PERSON play defense. There's a chance this was just rust and that PERSON will go back to doing the things that placed him in the ORGANIZATION' offseason infield conversation before he was shot; average range and plus actions at short, a plus arm, some speed, and feel for contact. He'll bounce back into the 45 FV tier if those things return in the spring, but he looked like a fringe bench piece last fall.",1
"A minor mechanical tweak unlocked some of PERSON's previously undiscovered raw power last year and he hit 26 home runs between PERSON and Triple-A. Some of that was due to the hitting environment in GPE, but scouts think the power uptick is real. PERSON already had a chance to be an everyday player because of his superlative bat-to-ball ability, speed and plus-plus defense at second base. With the power folded in, he's a potential star. Whether or not he debuts in GPE this year could depend on a PERSON trade, but he's probably ready.",1
"PERSON comes from the same ORGANIZATION program that spawned PERSON, the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in the 2011 Draft, and fellow big league pitcher PERSON. He spent his freshman year at catcher and his sophomore season at third base before returning to shortstop, his natural position, as a junior last spring.Though he struggled early on the showcase circuit, PERSON quieted his setup and performed better at the plate later in the summer and fall. He shows signs of becoming a solid hitter and offers surprising pop for a 5-foot-11 middle infielder.The ORGANIZATION recruit isn't a burner but moves well on the bases and in the field. His strong arm grades out at his best tool. PERSON will get every chance to stay at shortstop in pro ball, but if he can't, he may have enough bat for third base.",0
"ORGANIZATION's late surge as a GPE high schooler got him taken 10th overall by the ORGANIZATION in 2013, but he declined to sign for reasons that never have been explained fully. After showing pedestrian stuff at ORGANIZATION State ORGANIZATION as a freshman, he looked electric as a reliever in GPE Cod League, where scouts voted him the summer circuit's top prospect. That prompted him to abruptly transfer to a junior college (ORGANIZATION of LOCATION) so he'd be eligible for the 2015 Draft, in which he went 18th overall.Signed for $2,333,800, ORGANIZATION generates differences of opinion as to whether he'll be a starter or reliever because his stuff fluctuates. His fastball often hit 96 mph in 2013, parked at 88-92 at ORGANIZATION, touched 98 in the ORGANIZATION and sat in the low 90s with sink in junior college. His slider showed signs of becoming a plus pitch on the GPE but lacks consistency.ORGANIZATION still is honing his changeup and learning to trust it. He has an athletic delivery and fills the strike zone, which will help his cause to remain in the rotation.",0
"PERSON had just joined the D-backs organization in a deadline deal with the ORGANIZATION last summer, when a foul ball off his leg ended his system debut after four games. After a productive ORGANIZATION, PERSON got back to doing what he's done throughout his Minor Leauge career: hit with power.PERSON finished fifth in the Minors in home runs in 2014 despite missing the final month of the season and he continued to hit the long ball in Triple-A in 2015. He has the ability to hit the ball out of any park to all fields, when he makes contact. PERSON can't always tap into his power because of a lack of plate discipline and some serious swing-and-miss in his game, meaning he's never going to hit for a high average. It also remains unclear where PERSON fits defensively. He does have arm strength, but it appears his catching days are over as the D-backs have moved him to an outfield corner.Whether he can stick in right or left, or gives first base another try, it's his power bat that will eventually get him to the big leagues.",0
" PERSON was known as a glove-first shortstop when the ORGANIZATION drafted him in 2010, and he remains an elite defender now. He has the arm, range and hands to be an above-average defender at shortstop. Playing on the same team as PERSON in 2014 forced PERSON to split his time between shortstop and second base.  PERSON's bat isn't as advanced as his glove. He is still learning how to hit, and his swing has a tendency to get long. Without much power, he'll need to continue to improve his on-base skills.  Thanks to his defense, PERSON won't have to hit a ton to carve out a role in the ORGANIZATION. He still has time on his side, but will need to prove he can handle the more advanced pitching he'll face in the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION.",1
"A very young righty who signed for $600,000 last July, PERSON has a fastball in the 88-91 range and spins a good breaking ball on occasion. He's mechanically inconsistent, which impacts his fastball command and causes the shape of his curveball to vary, but PERSON is the age of a high school junior and it's unreasonable to expect more polish at this time. There's debate about whether or not his frame is actually projectable as, while his measurables indicate that it is, he's slight of build.",0
PERSON has a rock solid utility profile. He has foul line to foul line doubles power and just enough physical ability to stick at shortstop.,0
"PERSON became the first GPE citizen drafted when the ORGANIZATION took him out of GPE Joaquin Delta (Calif.) JC in the 38th round of the 2015 Draft, and the first to sign with an ORGANIZATION organization when the ORGANIZATION paid him $147,500 as a 14th-rounder out of Nevada-Las Vegas a year later. He has extensive experience pitching with GPE national teams and worked an inning in the 2017 World Baseball Classic. PERSON struggled as a swingman in high Class A last year but returned to level in 2018 and dominated as a starter. The performance netted PERSON his first Double-A promotion in early July, though he would make only one PERSON start (a seven-inning, 11-strikeout gem) before heading to the ORGANIZATION as one of five prospects dealt by the ORGANIZATION to get PERSON Machado.PERSON's best pitch is a fastball that sits at 91-95 mph, touches 97 and plays better than its velocity thanks to some armside run. He backs up his heater with a big-breaking curveball that he can land for strikes or get hitters to chase out of the zone. He has made improvements with his slider and changeup, which has helped fuel his success in 2018.He's also locating his pitches better this year, enhancing PERSON's chances of remaining a starter. He has demonstrated a consistent ability to miss bats that also could make him useful as a late-inning reliever. He didn't start pitching full-time until he got to junior college and was young for his draft class, so he has more room to develop than the typical pitcher in his third year in pro ball.",0
"After transferring from PERSON (Fla.) JC to GPE, PERSON erupted to hit an ORGANIZATION Conference-best 16 home runs as a junior, leading to his selection in the third round of the 2016 Draft. He became the first player from his class to reach the Majors the next year, earning a September promotion straight from Double-A after he'd produced a .329 average with 32 homers and 32 doubles across two levels. In 2018, PERSON was limited by a sore shoulder during the spring and then lost nearly two months of the season to a stress fracture in his ankle that ultimately required offseason surgery. The injury bug continued to plague PERSON in 2019, as suffered a thumb injury during Spring Training that delayed the start of his season and also missed time with a hamstring strain in June. PERSON showed during his first full season that he has the physical strength, bat speed and barrel control needed to hit for average and power at the highest level. While injuries robbed him of some of that explosiveness in 2018, PERSON also deviated from the hit-to-all-fields mentality that had made him successful in the previous year, as he all too often sold out for pull-side power in an attempt to replicate his 2017 results. He generally has an aggressive approach that leads to a lot of contact but nets him few walks, thus underscoring how PERSON' on-base skills are linked to his production.PERSON has played all three outfield positions as a pro, but profiles best in right field because he has average speed and range as well as plus arm strength. He will need to hit for average and power to hold down the position in the big leagues, and the ORGANIZATION are confident that a fully healthy PERSON will be able to get back on track toward reaching his potential in 2019.",1
"The 2014-15 PERSON of the Year in GPE, PERSON is a glove-first prospect with good speed (6.6 seconds in the 60-yard dash) and excellent range. The 6-foot, 185-pound shortstop has been described as a high-energy player who is making progress at the plate. PERSON is expected to be an everyday player when he gets called up to the big leagues, likely after some time in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON won a gold glove in GPE and made a name for himself with stellar defense. He's also a plus runner and should improve as a base stealer with professional instruction on a daily basis. Scouts like his makeup and his level of confidence. His arm is considered average. On offense, PERSON lacks power, but his light bat should improve as he develops. PERSON was declared a free agent by PERSON on Jan. 11, and he agreed to a $6 million deal with the ORGANIZATION to sign during the 2015-2016 period, though the club did not confirm the agreement. The ORGANIZATION ultimately signed PERSON for $7,000,000 when the 2016-2017 international signing period began on July 2..",0
"Strong-armed Texas high schoolers don't usually attend college in the LOCATION. PERSON took that path, however, in part because his brother attended graduate school at ORGANIZATION, and his family was moving to GPE. Now he's a good bet to become the first pitcher from the ORGANIZATION State to go in the first three rounds since PERSON and PERSON were first-rounders in 1998.A ORGANIZATION 26th-round pick in 2011, PERSON struggled as a freshman before becoming the ORGANIZATION' No. 1 starter and starring in the ORGANIZATION last year. He built on that momentum this spring, maintaining his 90-96 mph fastball deep into games. His slider generates swing and misses but still lacks consistency.PERSON's changeup features some deception and sink, but his nascent splitter could be an even more effective third pitch. His strong build should give him the durability required of a starter, though his high arm slot allows hitters to pick up his pitches more easily than scouts would like. He throws strikes but still is refining his command.",0
"Some believe PERSON might be the best prospect to ever come out of GPE. The switch-hitting shortstop is extremely athletic with above-average bat speed and solid arm strength. He has shown gap-to-gap power from both sides of the plate, and has good speed that plays in games. Scouts like his makeup and maturity.PERSON has experience in international tournaments, but he has not had a lot of exposure against quality pitching and it sometimes shows at the plate. The teenager has a smooth swing, and although it could use some work, most believe his bat will improve with age and instruction. On defense, PERSON has shown good hands, nice range and solid footwork, but is far from a finished product. PERSON should blossom as he comes into his own as a player, and his success will rely heavily on a club's player development program.",0
"Whenever a projectable high school pitcher shows a jump in stuff, he's bound to move up GPE boards. That's exactly what was happening with PERSON in GPE, though some concern about mechanics was giving some scouts pause.PERSON, a 6-foot-5 right-hander committed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE, had always intrigued because of his frame and fairly solid idea of how to pitch. When he went from throwing his fastball in the 88-92 range to sitting closer to 92-94 mph and touching 96, his stock definitely jumped. He'll complement the fastball with a slider that flashes average and he shows some feel for a changeup. PERSON uses a three-quarter arm slot with a high elbow, a kind of unorthodox delivery that will make some scouts pause. Given the leap he's made stuff-wise, a team is bound to look past that and nab him in the first few rounds of the GPE.",0
"The GPE has been known over the years to chew up pitchers and spit them out. GPE, who many thought would have a big 2016 season after a solid first full year of pro ball, definitely struggled in the hitter-friendly circuit, going 2-15 with a 6.31 ERA. Despite that, the ORGANIZATION feel the junior college product has a good chance to bounce back.GPE didn't pitch a ton at FACILITY A&M, totaling just 72 2/3 innings over two years, and pitching entirely in relief in his 2014 Draft year. The ORGANIZATION have worked to stretch him out as a starter and will continue to do so because he has the repertoire necessary to pitch out of a rotation. The 2016 season was his first as a full-time starter and his ability to find the strike zone consistently really backed up. He also lost the feel of his changeup, which graded as the best in the system a year ago internally. His heavy sinking fastball still got ground-ball outs when he kept it down, though that happened less frequently last year. His slider flashes as an above-average breaking ball, but not with any consistency.It's clear the mental wear of the GPE got to GPE. He'll get the chance to wipe the slate clean and the organization is still very much committed to him as a starting pitcher.",0
"One of the more projectable pitchers in the ORGANIZATION system, PERSON signed for $1.1 million as a second-round pick in 2014. Because he's young and needs time to physically develop, PERSON didn't allow him to exceed five innings before the 32nd start of his pro career last August.PERSON already pitches at 91-93 mph and reaches 96 with hard sink on his fastball, which could sit in the mid-90s once he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame. His secondary pitches lack consistency but show flashes of becoming solid offerings. He throws his slider in the low 80s and his changeup has some fade and sink.PERSON has a quick arm and a clean delivery, so he's able to repeat his delivery and throw strikes with ease. Once he adds strength and refines his secondary pitches and command, he could blossom into a mid-rotation starter.",0
"PERSON has hit everywhere he's gone since the ORGANIZATION drafted him 37th overall in 2010. PERSON hopes that will continue in its system after the club acquired him as part of the trade that sent PERSON to GPE in July.PERSON doesn't have any real standout tools; instead, he is a steady all-around performer. He has a knack for putting the bat on the ball, despite an unconventional timing mechanism in his swing. PERSON is an aggressive hitter, and he has developed solid power as he has matured.PERSON is a below-average runner, limiting his range defensively. Still, he has the hands and footwork necessary to be an average defender at second base. PERSON earns praise for his makeup, and he knows how to get the most out of his tools. He profiles as an offensive-minded second baseman.",0
"When PERSON became the first ORGANIZATION Division I team in 21 years to win a regional tournament in its playoff debut last June, PERSON was named Most Outstanding Player after picking up two victories in the four days. He followed up with a strong summer in the ORGANIZATION and has performed well again this spring.PERSON can hit 94 mph with his fastball, but he usually pitches at 88-92 mph. He lacks downhill plane because he's 6 feet tall and leaves his heater up in the strike zone more than he should, but it's effective because his extreme crossfire delivery produces run and sink and allows him to get inside against righties.PERSON's breaking ball varies between a fringy slider in the lower 80s and a promising cutter in the upper 80s, and he may want to focus on the cutter in pro ball. His changeup has some sink and is an effective third pitch. He throws enough strikes to remain a starter, though his lack of a true plus pitch gives him little margin for error.",0
"Wherever PERSON has been, he's hit. He parlayed a career .348 average and .469 on-base percentage into an eight-round selection in the 2015 Draft by the ORGANIZATION. PERSON taken that late have to prove themselves level-by-level, and PERSON did just that, hitting over .300 in his pro debut and full-season debut in 2016. He kept on hitting and getting on-base enough to earn a late promotion to Double-A at the end of the Double-A season.PERSON has used a contact-first approach to hit .311 in his pro career heading into the 2018 season, while his strike zone discipline is also advanced, leading to a .413 on-base percentage as well. Right now he is all about line drives to the gaps from the left side of the plate, but he does have close to average raw power that his approach doesn't let him get to. The ORGANIZATION will continue to work with PERSON on small mechanical changes to try to tap into that pop a little, though he'll always be hit over power. He doesn't look pretty behind the plate and needs to continue to work on his receiving and game-calling, but he manages to get the job done, throwing out just over 30 percent of would-be basestealers in his career.The ORGANIZATION are confident he can stick behind the plate, and left-handed hitting backstops are always a hot commodity, at least as backups. If he can continue to hit and find a way to add a little power, he might outperform those projections.",0
"Born in GPE, PERSON moved to the GPE for his sophomore year of high school in 2016. Since arriving with a mid-80s fastball, he has developed into the hardest thrower in the '19 prep class. He repeatedly reached the upper 90s on the showcase circuit last summer and broke PERSON's Under PERSON All-America Game record with a fastball clocked at 99 mph. PERSON usually works at 94-97 mph and has reached triple digits with his fastball. He can overpower hitters with sheer velocity, gets good riding action on his four-seamer and can show heavy sink on a two-seamer. Opponents can't afford to sit on his heater because he has a pair of power breaking pitches, with his sharp low-80s slider currently grading better than his upper-70s curveball with good depth.PERSON dabbles with a changeup that gets too firm but flashes good sink at times. The ORGANIZATION State recruit's control and command are inconsistent, in part because he has a long arm action, so some scouts project him more as a reliever than as a starter. There's not a lot of projection remaining in his frame, which is smaller than his listed height and weight, but his present stuff already is plenty good.",0
"After winning ORGANIZATION accolades at the World Junior Championships in 2010, PERSON was set to sign with the ORGANIZATION for $350,000 as a 16-year-old until the ORGANIZATION threatened to ban him from ever playing or coaching in GPE if he signed before graduating from high school. He waited to do so, then broke the bonus record for GPE position players by signing with the ORGANIZATION for $2.05 million in 2012. He seemed headed for obscurity after posting a .614 OPS in his first five pro seasons before breaking out in Double-A this year and helping GPE as a stopgap solution at third base in the Majors.Even when he wasn't producing offensively, PERSON controlled the strike zone well. He still does, and he also has become more selectively aggressive and tries to drive the ball on occasion. His plus speed remains his best tool, though it never has translated into much in the way of stolen bases.A versatile defender, PERSON has seen action at shortstop, second base, third base and center field. With his quickness, average arm and offensive profile, he's best suited for the middle infield. He has given the ORGANIZATION a lift at the hot corner and could have a future as a utilityman if he continues to hold his own at the plate.",1
"When the ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $10,000 as a nondrafted free agent out of ORGANIZATION in 2014, it might have been perceived as a favor to his cousin, PERSON. But he has proven himself to be a legitimate prospect, breaking out in Double-A in 2017 and winning Triple-A PERSON MVP honors this season. He followed up with a solid performance in the ORGANIZATION, forcing GPE to protect him on its 40-man roster rather than risk losing him in the Rule 5 Draft.PERSON' strength is his ability to make repeated hard contact, which helped him make a run at league batting titles in each of the last two years and top the ORGANIZATION in runs (93), hits (180), doubles (39), extra-base hits (65) and total bases (285). Most of his power currently comes in the form of doubles but he might develop into a 20-homer threat if he added some loft to his right-handed stroke. He doesn't strike out much, yet he puts the bat on the ball so easily that he rarely draws walks.PERSON lacks quickness but has a strong arm and covers enough ground to serve as an average defender at third base. He has soft hands that also work well at first base, where he has seen action throughout his pro career. Though it remains to be seen if and where he'll break into the ORGANIZATION' crowded infield, he doesn't have much left to accomplish in the Minors.",0
"GSP is the quintessential scrappy college shortstop. None of his tools grade as better than average, but scouts love the way he plays the game and think his work ethic and versatility could translate into a big league role as a utilityman.Though GSP didn't perform well with wood bats in the ORGANIZATION last summer, he rebounded with a strong spring. He has a short, quick right-handed stroke and does a fine job of controlling the strike zone. He has more pop than most middle infielders and can hit mistakes out of the park.With average quickness and fringy range, GSP won't be an everyday shortstop at the next level. But he has enough athleticism, instincts and arm to play almost anywhere on the diamond. If he's going to become a regular, it would be at second base.",0
"The younger brother of former GPE first-rounder PERSON, PERSON stood out mostly for his defense during his first two years at ORGANIZATION before breaking out at the plate as a junior, leading to his selection by the ORGANIZATION in the fifth round of the 2015 ORGANIZATION. After he signed for $335,400, PERSON took the Class A Short PERSON by storm, winning ORGANIZATION honors and leading the league in average (.358), stolen bases (47), on-base percentage (.432) and runs scored (64). As a result of his success, the ORGANIZATION sent PERSON to Class A Advanced Bakersfield to begin his first full season. PERSON hit a collective .184 between his freshman and sophomore seasons with the ORGANIZATION, and his offensive struggles carried over to the 2014 Cape Cod League, where he hit just .196 with his ORGANIZATION stock on the line. But things came together for him as a junior, and he continued to make strides at the plate in his pro debut after he shortened his swing. He's a disciplined hitter and makes a lot of contact, which in turn allows him to utilize his plus wheels. While he'll never offer much in the way of power, PERSON did show more consistent pop to the gaps in the LOCATION League.Defensively, PERSON shouldn't have trouble sticking at shortstop, where he profiles as an above-average defender with soft hands, good range and an absolute cannon for an arm. Though still has quite a bit to prove at the plate in spite of his impressive pro debut, PERSON could turn out to be one of the biggest steals of the 2015 ORGANIZATION with another strong showing in his first full season.",0
"The ORGANIZATION had been linked for months to PERSON, a GPE defector, before signing him in late July for $1.5 million and a matching penalty for exceeding their international bonus allotment. He was one of GPE's biggest expenditures as it exceeded its international pool for the first time. Though he had limited success in sporadic playing time in 2012-14 in GPE's PERSON, he was one of the league's youngest players and fared better in the island's 18-and-under and 23-and-under leagues.PERSON stands out most for his offensive potential. He has a quick right-handed bat and has added strength since defecting, giving him intriguing raw power for a middle infielder. He's aggressive at the plate but makes consistent contact and uses the entire field.While PERSON has just average speed, the ORGANIZATION believe he'll be able to stay at shortstop. He has good actions and a quick first step, giving him range to both sides. He also has soft hands and solid arm strength that should fit well at second or third base should he need to change positions.",0
"PERSON popped on the scouting radar when he outpitched the late PERSON in a GPE playoff matchup in 2014, though his commitment to PERSON made him slide to the ORGANIZATION in the 36th round. After winning LOCATION pitcher of the year honors as a sophomore and performing well in the ORGANIZATION and fall practice, he entered 2017 as a potential second-round pick. While his stuff hasn't been as sharp during his junior season, he still has one of the higher floors as a starter among college pitchers and is a lock to become the first Paladin ever drafted in the first five rounds.PERSON reached 96 mph with nasty sink on his fastball during fall ball, but he has pitched more at 88-92 and topped out at 94 with a less heavy heater this spring. He has full trust in his changeup, which shows signs of becoming a plus pitch but has graded more as an average offering in 2017. The same is true of his curveball and cutter, which flashed solid more often in the past.While he isn't especially big, PERSON has gotten stronger during three years of college. He has no issues repeating his delivery and pounding the strike zone. PERSON also love his competitive demeanor and he has all the ingredients to become an effective No. 4 starter.",0
"The ORGANIZATION used both of their first-round picks on up-the-middle preps in 2013, selecting PERSON with the ninth-overall pick and then nabbing ORGANIZATION at ORGANIZATION. 14, targeting the GPE state product for his revered defensive prowess. He reached Double-A for the first time in 2016, the same year that he was dealt with PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION at the ORGANIZATION. Sidelined with a left oblique injury for much of the first half in 2017, ORGANIZATION performed well back in Double-A after making a healthy return in July and then made up for lost time in the ORGANIZATION Winter League during the offseason.ORGANIZATION's defense has long been his calling card, and there's little doubt that it will get him to the big leagues. An excellent blocker and receiver who garners high praise for his game-calling and his ability to handle a staff, ORGANIZATION also is adept at controlling the running game with his plus arm and efficient pop technique. At the plate, ORGANIZATION continues to show natural hitting ability with a level, line-drive producing swing and advanced feel for the zone, and he even showed an uptick in power in 2017, connecting on a career-high six home runs with Double-A New Hampshire despite playing in just 34 games. ORGANIZATION's stock as a hitter seemingly is on the rise now that he's healthy. His glove, meanwhile, is good enough for him to carve out a role as defensive-minded backup, if not a regular in the big leagues.",1
"GPE has not developed as expected to this point. We anticipated he'd move quickly to third base in pro ball, but hit for enough power to overcome it. Instead, he has held serve a shortstop and only just begun to see time at third, but has struggled to get to his considerable raw power in games. His lower half usage has improved, but GPE's bat still has downward entry into the hitting zone and he doesn't extend well through contact. He has a nearly 50% groundball rate as a pro and ends up pushing a lot of contact the other way. There's ceiling here because of GPE's shot to stay at short and adjust his way into game power, but there's a low floor if he moves to third and can't make tweaks.",0
"If you showed up to see PERSON play on the right day, you might see the best player on the field. On other days, you might leave scratching your head.There's no question PERSON has some tools in his big, strong and athletic frame. A Gulf Coast League teammate with PERSON and PERSON, PERSON has been a bit slower to develop than his counterparts, though he'll still be just 21 years old for the 2014 season. While still working to find a level of consistency, PERSON has some serious right-handed raw power. He will be able to tap into that power more if he can refine his approach and learn to not try to do too much at the plate. With a strong arm and his offensive upside, PERSON profiles well as a future right fielder.PERSON and PERSON may have moved more quickly, but time is still on PERSON's side.",0
"The home run ball returned with a vengeance in GPE League Baseball in 2017, but that doesn't mean teams aren't still in need of the table-setters to get on base and run in front of the slugging run producers. When a hitter like PERSON also plays up the middle defensively, teams are definitely going to sit up and pay attention.While he is a bit undersized at 5-foot-10, PERSON' performance over the summer and into his senior season had many evaluators looking past that. His speed is his best tool, an easy plus that allows him to get down the line in a hurry from both sides of the plate and be a basestealing threat. He has a contact-oriented approach and uses all fields well, and while he's not likely to be a home run threat, he could grow into his frame for more extra-base pop with an PERSON type of build. He has excellent actions and footwork at shortstop and has shown he has enough arm to stay on the left side of the infield.Assuming teams can look past his size, the one other hurdle might be his commitment to GPE. PERSON is a good student whose parents are educators, so he'll have to go early enough to bypass college, a distinct possibility.",0
" Since signing him with an over-slot deal in 2010, the ORGANIZATION didn't hesitate to challenge PERSON a bit, sending him to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League for his debut, largely against much older competition. Then he spent the 2012 season in full-season ball at age 20 and while his overall numbers were mixed, he finished very strongly, with a 1.68 ERA over his final nine starts. The big right-hander could have three above-average-or-better pitches and above-average command when all is said and done. PERSON will touch 95 mph with his fastball, with plenty of movement. His changeup has deceptive sink, and it's been his best secondary offering in the past. His curve may have caught up, and the power breaking ball might be just as good down the road. The ORGANIZATION were very aggressive in going after high-ceiling high school arms in the past few Drafts and PERSON has the chance to be one of the best from that effort.",0
Plus runner with a long swing. Has bench outfield tools.,0
"When you're given $2.5 million to sign out of GPE and you don't seem to progress much over the first several years in the Minors, people will get down on you. But just when it looked like PERSON was on the cusp of being labeled a bust, he made some very good strides in 2014 and made his big league debut. PERSON struggled for a while in adjusting both to the speed of the pro game and a new country and culture. He started to open some eyes in 2014, despite an oblique injury that took him a while to come back from 100 percent. PERSON still has the raw tools that made him such a big international prospect, with an ability to punish the ball. PERSON started to show a semblance of a better approach at the plate. He can run well and has a strong arm, perfect for right field, though he can play center if needed. Still very young, the hope was that 2014 was just the first step and the September callup would motivate him to get back to GPE, something he did briefly in July.",1
"Not to be confused with PERSON, a GPE high school right-hander who's a potential first-rounder, PERSON is one of the best prep hitters available. He flew under the radar a bit because he wasn't selected for many top showcase events last summer, though he did make his presence felt at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in October. He has built off that momentum this spring and could factor in the top three rounds.PERSON has a sweet right-handed swing and advanced feel for manipulating the barrel. He has added strength and his bat looks quicker this spring, giving him at least average power potential despite a lack of physicality. Most of his pop presently comes to his pull side, and there could be more to come if he adds more muscle and more loft to his stroke.A shortstop in high school, PERSON projects best defensively at third base. He has the hands and instincts to stay on the dirt, though he has below-average speed and an average arm with inconsistent accuracy. He does have a good first step, and some scouts would try him at second base while others wonder if he might wind up in left field.",0
"After having PERSON surgery in high school, PERSON became a full-time hitter in his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION and worked just 22 2/3 innings as a junior in 2016. Power appeared to be his best tool -- as it was for his older brother, PERSON, who spent five years in the big leagues -- yet the ORGANIZATION drafted him in the seventh round as a pitcher. He has gotten better as he climbed through the ORGANIZATION and has thrived at extremely hitter-friendly high Class A Lancaster this year.PERSON has more pitches than a typical reliever. He can overpower hitters with his fastball, which has zoomed from 92-95 mph in college to 95-99 in pro ball, and his cutter, which resides in the low 90s. He also has a true slider in the low 80s and will throw an occasional changeup.While PERSON' control has regressed a bit in 2018, he has limited damage by rarely missing up in the strike zone. He went more than three months without surrendering an extra-base hit, an almost unfathomable accomplishment for a pitcher toiling in Lancaster and the GPE. If he can throw a few more strikes, he might be a closer.",0
"Converted catcher. 91-94, touched 97, above-average slider, potential relief fit.",0
"GPE is right there with GPE in the ORGANIZATION system when it comes to upside. He shows three plus pitches at times and may be a better athlete than GPE, so the elements of frontline starter potential are here. GPE works in the mid-90's early in games with plus life and at his best, he'll pair it with a changeup with similar action and a slider that can play even better than 60 when ideally used and located. Like most young power arms, GPE's command and velocity degrade in the middle innings as his focus and intensity wane and fatigue starts to set in. More advanced hitters can lay off his lively stuff when it's more area-type control than MLB-level pitch execution. PERSON like GPE's makeup, coachability, and athleticism (most prefer him to GPE in this regard) and expect him to continue to improve in these areas.",0
"A baseball rat who comes from a baseball family -- his brother PERSON is now in the ORGANIZATION' system and his father PERSON served as the head coach at ORGANIZATION powerhouse PERSON as well as the 18-and-under GPE ORGANIZATION Team -- PERSON turned in his best offensive season in 2016 and made his big league debut last September.PERSON is never going to be the kind of player who wows with flashy tools. He's more the type that you grow to appreciate after multiple viewings. He's always hit, topped by finishing third in the ORGANIZATION in batting average a year ago. He makes consistent hard line-drive contact with gap power, but his defense at shortstop has come into question. PERSON and hands-wise, he's just fine, but his throwing accuracy has become an issue due to inconsistencies with his footwork. It's been something he's tried to work through for some time, but as the game has sped up, it's become a more glaring weakness.He played some second base during his time in the ORGANIZATION, and he'll continue to see time there to improve his versatility. He could develop into an everyday second baseman or become a valuable utility man in the near future.",1
"PERSON's junior stats at LOCATION read like he was playing ORGANIZATION on the rookie difficulty setting. It was his first year as a starter and he struck out 144 hitters in 102 innings while walking just 18. He's a side-armer with a running, low-90s fastball and above-average slider. Both pitches play up because of PERSON's command, and at times his stuff is so well-located that it's unhittable. He was our favorite to be the first from the 2018 draft class to reach the big leagues but a 2019 spring forearm injury might delay his arrival.",0
"Few players have taken a more circuitous road to the big leagues than PERSON. He signed as an outfielder with the ORGANIZATION for $110,000 as a 14th-round pick in 2006 but never got past Class A before getting released following the 2010 season. He made just three pitching appearances in the independent PERSON in 2011 before hooking up with the ORGANIZATION and reaching the Majors three years later. After beating testicular cancer last offseason, he returned to the big leagues with GPE in 2015 before going to the ORGANIZATION along with PERSON catcher PERSON in an August trade for PERSON Venable.The first PERSON to reach the Majors, PERSON always showed tremendous arm strength as an outfielder and it has translated well to the mound. He works at 94-96 mph and can reach 98 with his fastball. He also throws a hard slider that can be a plus pitch at its best but lacks consistency.The key to PERSON finding a permanent role in the Majors will be learning to harness his stuff, which can be overpowering at times, but has trouble finding the strike zone at others. He gives up too many walks and falls behind in the count too often, allowing hitters to sit on and tee off on his fastball.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 14, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON was a Perfect Game Underclass honorable mention in 2016. The shortstop was highlighted as a coveted prospect by nine different college programs before he committed to PERSON Forest.Poteet stands out at the plate with a thin, wiry frame. He hooks contact with a big leg kick, and though he sometimes struggles to maintain balance at the plate, he has a playable arm in the field. He has room for further development.",0
"PERSON walked away from the chance to be a potential two-way player at ORGANIZATION State when the ORGANIZATION went over slot to sign him in 2012. He wasn't able to follow up his strong first full season, struggling in the hitting haven of ORGANIZATION and the advanced hitting of the Double-A LOCATION in 2014.Small, but athletic, PERSON has average stuff, at best, across the board. His fastball will sit at around 89-90 mph, though he can touch 92-93 mph, and it does have some good life to it. His changeup is his best secondary pitch and his slow curve is effective at times. His athleticism allows him to repeat his delivery and it comes with deception. PERSON's biggest enemy has been his control, not because of wildness, but rather because he tries to nibble at the corners, especially off the outer half of the plate, too much.Just 21 years old, there's time for PERSON to get back on track and reach his ceiling as a No. 4 or 5 starter, but he's going to have to start attacking the strike zone to get there.",0
"Every Draft, scouts bemoan the lack of college bats worth considering in the early rounds. That's why when one comes out and outperforms expectations, they tend to move up boards. That's certainly been true of ORGANIZATION, who has combined a greatly improved bat with top-of-the-scale speed to become a very intriguing prospect.There is no question about ORGANIZATION's speed. On his high school track team, he ran a 10.6-second, 100-yard dash and that speed translates well on the diamond. He's a definite basestealing threat, one who knows his job is to get on base and wreak havoc. He played second base last year for ORGANIZATION, but moved to shortstop this year, where his speed helps him range-wise, but his other skills likely fall short. Most scouts see a move to center field in his future, where that speed would really be an asset. While he's always hit for average, he's hitting with more authority this year, showing some surprising extra-base pop.They say you can't teach speed and that is something ORGANIZATION definitely brings to the table. The development of his other offensive skills in his junior season has moved him firmly into top-three-round consideration.",0
" PERSON passed on signing with the ORGANIZATION as a 17th-rounder in 2016 and instead opted for his senior season at ORGANIZATION, where he posted a 1.79 ORGANIZATION and 12 saves to finish with the second-most saves (21) in program history. The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their third-round pick in June, and he proved to be far more than just a money-saving selection during his pro debut after signing for $454,800 below slot value.  PERSON draws comparisons to PERSON because he's a lanky, side-armed right-hander with two above-average pitches. His combination of a low 90s fastball, that touches 95 mph, and a tight slider makes PERSON highly effective against same-sided hitters, and he's already impressed ORGANIZATION club officials with his ability to throw strikes from his unique slot.As a low-slot reliever who features both velocity and control, PERSON has the potential to jump on the fast track to the ORGANIZATION in 2018 after reaching full-season ball during his pro debut.",0
"A very likely big league role player with limited ceiling, PERSON is a twitchy, multi-positional infielder with good hands/actions. He's a switch-hitter with good feel for contact from both sides of the plate, and he also runs well, so there are all kinds of scenarios where his skillset would be useful throughout a game. But PERSON's total lack of power will probably be a barrier to an everyday role.",0
"A 30th-round pick by the ORGANIZATION out of high school in 2013, PERSON opted not to sign and instead honored his commitment to GPE, where he pitched for one season before transferring to PERSON and sitting out for all of '15. Taken by GPE in the 22nd round the following year, PERSON is looking like a Draft steal after making steady progress in each pro season en route to his first taste of Double-A in 2018.A two-sport standout who could have played college basketball, PERSON's tremendous athleticism translates and gives him big upside on the mound. The 6-foot-4 right-hander has an exceptional sinker -- it has an average spin rate of about 1900 rpm -- that sits in the low 90s and nets him ground balls at an elite clip. His 59.7 percent ground-ball rate in 2018 was tops among qualified starters in the ORGANIZATION' farm system and ranked inside the top 10 in the entire Minors. PERSON pairs his heater with a quality changeup, giving him two above-average offerings, and the ORGANIZATION have been pleased with his development of a slider.PERSON possesses average control and command because his athleticism allows him to repeat his delivery and arm action so well. That feel for pounding the zone allows for PERSON's three-pitch mix to play up, and he's never had issues keeping the ball in the park. PERSON is still a work-in-progress, and therefore his ceiling is still coming into view, but his impressive development and remaining projection portends to at least a back-end starter role at the highest level.",0
"PERSON was the ORGANIZATION' top July 2 signee from 2018 at $700,000. He's an average runner (he ran a 7.1 60-yard-dash in workouts) with good instincts in center field; he'll stay there if he speeds up as he matures as an athlete. His current swing is somewhat long but again, PERSON has advanced feel to hit, enough to compensate for his mechanical maladies right now. He has a better chance of either hitting, staying in center field, or both, than the outfielders in the Others of GPE section on this list.",0
"Trading PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in December 2011 has worked out well for the A's, who received PERSON, corner-infield prospect PERSON and PERSON in return. PERSON had a rough first season in his new organization, but he bounced back in 2013 to assert himself as the system's top pitching prospect. Unfortunately, PERSON injured his elbow in the spring of 2014 and he had PERSON surgery in May.When healthy, PERSON usually operates at 92-93 mph with his fastball, and he can reach 96 mph. PERSON has done a fine job of refining his changeup in his two years in GPE's system, to the point where it now ranks as his second-best pitch. His hard slider can also be a weapon at times, albeit with less consistency.Scouts who saw PERSON in low Class A in 2012 and '13 noted his improved mound presence the second time around, as he learned to trust his stuff and attack hitters. His control and command took a step forward, and if PERSON continues to improve, he could be a No. 2 or 3 starter.",1
"PERSON's cacophonous post-draft summer -- .361/.409/.510 -- caused some re-evaluation after he had just gotten about $200,000 as an 11th rounder a few months earlier. We're still not all in. His 2018 line included a .386 ORGANIZATION against competition beneath what he faced in college, he didn't walk much, and visual evaluations yielded mixed feelings about his ability to sustain anything approaching that kind of game power. PERSON is remarkably short to the baseball and tough to beat with velocity because his hands work in such a tight little circle. A more athletic, full-bodied swing may yield more pop, which, if it doesn't take too much from his ability to make contact, would be a meaningful improvement. Realistically, he might be a utility infielder with bat and speed. He's at Hi-A and soon turns 23.",0
"The FACILITY Sox were able to sign PERSON, a GPE high school standout, away from his commitment to the ORGANIZATION of GPE and sent him out to pitch in relief in the GPE League during his professional debut in 2012, and he also pitched almost exclusively out of the bullpen. Whether that's his long-term home remains to be seen, but PERSON has some pretty intriguing stuff. Using a low, three-quarters delivery that creates deception, PERSON will throw his fastball in the low 90s with plus movement. He throws a slider that can be very sharp at times and will show an ability to sink a changeup as well. Some are concerned about his arm action and delivery, a reason for the sentiment that he should be a reliever persists. PERSON might have the stuff to handle late-inning situations in the future if it's proven that starting isn't for him.",1
"GPE's developmental path had him poised to make his big league debut in 2014 after a 2013 season that saw him reach Triple-A. Instead, GPE had PERSON surgery in early April and missed the entire season. Surgery and rehab went well, and he was working his way back to pitching competitively 2015 when an inguinal hernia required surgery in July. When healthy, GPE has three above-average to plus pitches at his disposal, all coming from a big 6-foot-5 frame. His fastball sits in the mid 90s, and he maintains his velocity deep into starts. He has an outstanding curve, a big overhand breaking ball that can miss bats as well. His changeup hasn't been as consistent, but it has shown flashes of being at least a Major League average pitch. While wildness hasn't been a real issue, GPE's overall command hadn't been as sharp. ORGANIZATION and feel for pitching often is what takes the longest to come back post-surgery. The good news is that, at age 23 for all of the 2015 season, GPE is still ahead of the curve.",0
"PERSON began 2019 as the top-rated four-year college pitching prospect in the ORGANIZATION despite spending most of his sophomore season at ORGANIZATION as a reliever. But now he's an enigma after getting shut down after five starts this spring with what was termed a hamstring injury. His fastball dipped into the mid-80s and his slider was less sharp, and he didn't show he could succeed or hold up as starter.PERSON may have the best slider in the ORGANIZATION when he's 100 percent, displaying mid-80s velocity and two-plane break that make it a plus-plus pitch at its best. He also has a better fastball than most left-handers when he's at his best, operating at 91-96 mph with some sink. His changeup is in its nascent stages because he hadn't needed it much coming out of the bullpen.Even before his confusing year, PERSON came with some red flags. He has a soft body and lacks athleticism, which leads to questions as to whether he can repeat his delivery well enough to make it as a starter. He sometimes gets offline to the plate, costing him fastball command.",0
"PERSON ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, GPE.) spawned fifth-rounders in both 2014 (ORGANIZATION) and 2016 (PERSON), and has another player who could go in the same territory this June. That prospect was supposed to be catcher/right-hander PERSON, but he has been surpassed by ORGANIZATION, who broke out by reaching 95 mph in a January showcase. He acquitted himself well during the spring, dominating highly touted PERSON and PERSON in March and fanning 30 in a pair of playoff starts in April.ORGANIZATION regularly sits at 91-93 mph with running action on his fastball and should hold his velocity deeper into games as he gets stronger. His low-80s slider isn't as reliable yet but projects as a second solid offering, and he also owns a curveball with good depth. Though he hasn't needed a changeup very often, he has shown the makings of a decent one with some sink.ORGANIZATION's arm action is a bit long but he repeats his delivery well and generally throws strikes. He comes with some concerns about his size, listed at what scouts believe is a generous 6-foot-2, and his lack of history against quality competition. He's also a good student who may be difficult to sign away from a GPE commitment.",0
"A conversion arm whose command took a significant step forward in 2017, his fourth year devoted to pitching, PERSON made his major league debut in 2018 before succumbing to a rotator cuff injury for the rest of the season. He began 2019 in the bullpen, throwing about 45 pitches per outing, but his last two appearances were starts. 
His changeup and command have developed enough to consider him a long-term starter but the power curveball, which suffered a stark downtick in spin rate before he was shut down last year, is his best pitch. The shoulder stuff, a short stride, and early-season deployment in the bullpen have us somewhat concerned about PERSON's long term health and role, but on stuff he's a potential No. 4 starter.",1
"The ORGANIZATION went well above slot to secure PERSON, signing him for $325,000 as an 18th-round pick in 2011. A reliever from the outset of his pro career, he made a steady climb through the ORGANIZATION en route and made his big league debut in August 2015. PERSON has ideal stuff for a late-inning bullpen role. His fastball typically sits between 93-96 mph, but he showed the ability to push it as high as 98 in 2015. His slider has fastball velocity at 89-92 mph, thrown with tight spin and late, short slicing action that helps him miss bats, and he'll mix in a curveball sparingly to give hitters a different look. The right-hander has some crossfire to his delivery, which gives him natural deception but limits his strike-throwing potential. PERSON and command issues aside, PERSON's knack for generating whiffs with his fastball-slider pairing highlights his late-inning potential in the big leagues.",0
"GPE of a banner ORGANIZATION 2011 international crop that included fellow Dominicans PERSON and PERSON, PERSON signed for $300,000. He ranked sixth in the Minors with 54 steals in 2015, his first extended foray into full-season ball, but he never hit with much authority before he suddenly started driving the ball in Double-A this year. The ORGANIZATION acquired him and right-hander PERSON in an August trade that sent PERSON to GPE York.PERSON's plus arm is his best tool and allows him to make all the throws at shortstop. He has soft hands and smooth infield actions, making him a viable defender at short, second base or third base. That versatility helps his cause because he profiles more as a utilityman than a regular. Offensively, PERSON has proven that he can make consistent contact from the right side of the plate and use his solid speed to steal bases. But his lack of pop has given pitchers little reason to fear him, resulting in substandard on-base and slugging percentages. His Double-A power surge hasn't carried over to Triple-A, reinforcing the notion that he'll be more of a backup than a starter at the big league level.",1
"PERSON showcased well-above-average speed and defense as GPE's center fielder, but scouts continued to question his hitting ability leading up to the 2015 GPE. The ORGANIZATION felt confident enough in his bat to take him in the third round of the GPE, and he quickly validated their assessment in his pro debut by hitting .320 and finishing second in the Class A Short PERSON League.Named to the Pac-12 All-Defensive Team two years in a row, PERSON is a true center fielder who takes good routes and gets good reads on fly balls, using his outstanding speed to his advantage. An aggressive baserunner, PERSON will be a basestealing threat at the next level, though he does have gains to make with both his technique and feel for reading pitchers. Whether he can profile as a top-of-the-order regular will depend on how much his bat develops. He does have some bat speed with an ability to hit the gaps with line drives, and he's shorter to the ball now after the ORGANIZATION helped him clean up his swing last summer. He should add some strength as he matures, which should lead to more gap power, but he's never going to be a home run threat. If all goes as planned with his development, PERSON could be manning center field and hitting at or near the top of the lineup for the ORGANIZATION in several years.",0
"GPE opted to attend PERSON rather than sign with the ORGANIZATION out of high school, and he had two bad years there before turning in a solid junior season. He didn't hit for power in pro ball until he reached Double-A in 2018, where GPE exploded for 26 home runs, saw his walk rate climb all the way to 18%, and swiped 20 bags. 
Nothing about GPE's swing is markedly different than it was in college. He's tightened the circle made by his ritualistic, pre-swing bat swirl, and his hands load a little bit lower now than they used to, but mostly GPE just has good feel for low-ball contact despite the upright nature of his swing, and has plus bat speed. 
There's skepticism surrounding GPE's ability to play second base, so the ORGANIZATION began expanding his defensive horizons last year with time at first and third base, as well as both outfield corners, which is where GPE saw the most action in the ORGANIZATION. The uppercut nature of GPE's swing is going to lead to some strikeouts and his aggregate offensive profile looks much less promising in an outfield corner than it would at second base. If he could indeed play all of those positions, he'd be a very interesting GPE ORGANIZATION knife with power, but realistically he profiles as a second-division regular or platoon outfielder.",1
"There are some real high school baseball powers in GPE. PERSON, where PERSON pitches and hits, is not one of them, but PERSON made a name for himself by pitching well at a number of showcase events last summer.While PERSON plays two ways in high school, his future is most certainly on the mound. The left-hander is fairly physically mature, with a three-pitch mix he uses well. His fastball this spring has been in the 88-91 mph range, sometimes touching a tick higher. He throws a solid breaking ball that sometimes has slider shape and some see more as a power curve and he has shown the ability to throw a changeup with good arm speed. There is some effort in his delivery, which can impact his overall command, and there is a debate about whether his future is as a starter or reliever, where his plus competitiveness would be an asset. A team taking him in the top five or six rounds and signing him away from his GPE commitment will give him every chance to stick in a rotation.",0
"After a promising 2014 full-season debut in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON held his own in the ORGANIZATION State League in '15 despite being one of its younger players. After the season, the ORGANIZATION dealt him to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for PERSON. The young ORGANIZATION infielder has largely played second base and it is his best position, with the chance for him to be an above-average defender there. But he's capable of playing shortstop as well, though his range -- thanks to his fringy speed -- is probably better suited for the right side of the diamond. PERSON isn't all glove, though, with a very good feel for making consistent contact. He doesn't walk very much, but he also doesn't strike out a ton. He's an advanced offensive player for his age, one who has a line-drive approach to all fields and has the chance to add a little pop as he matures.Along with top prospect PERSON, the ORGANIZATION could produce an interesting double-play combination in the coming years.",0
"PERSON hit .240 in his first three years at LOCATION before batting .346 with 20 steals as a senior in 2015, winning the PERSON as college baseball's top catcher and Pacific-12 Conference defensive player of the year honors. Signed for $100,000 as an eighth-rounder, he opened more eyes by hitting .304/.391/.469 while advancing to Double-A during his first full pro season. He started last year in similar fashion but slumped in May and never snapped out of it, finishing at .232/.328/.321.PERSON is better than his 2017 numbers and has rebounded this season, but at 5-foot-10 and 175 pounds he's not equipped to handle a full season's workload behind the plate. He also looked worn down at the end of 2016 in the ORGANIZATION and will have to do a better job of managing his strength via nutrition and weightlifting. While he may not have the stamina to be a regular in the big leagues, he has the tools to be a quality backup.Using a simple left-handed swing, PERSON makes consistent line-drive contact and excels at managing the strike zone. He's not geared for power but does have average speed and provides more value on the bases than a typical catcher. His athleticism pays off behind the plate, where he receives well and enhances his solid arm strength with a quick transfer.",0
"While the Reds are not afraid to make big splashes on the international market, GPE was a much quieter under-the-radar signing in February 2013. It's been a slow development process for the toolsy outfielder, spending two years in the ORGANIZATION and two more in the Rookie-Level PERSON and PERSON before finally making his full-season debut in 2017. A premium athlete, the Reds say the 6-foot-3 GPE's strength and speed reminds them of two-sport standouts who played football as amateurs in the ORGANIZATION. GPE's plus speed allows him to be a basestealing threat and to cover a lot of ground in the outfield. He's shown some ability to play all three outfield positions, but he's settled into right field in the ORGANIZATION, at least partially in deference to other center fielders on PERSON's roster. GPE should have enough arm to handle the corner, and there's a chance the switch-hitter's bat will profile well there, too. He has an advanced approach at the plate and draws plenty of walks, though he can be overly patient at times. GPE is still growing into some power. The Reds have been patient in letting GPE move at his own pace, and that's not likely to stop soon. He might be a fourth outfielder when all is said and done, but don't rule out seeing him blossom into a solid all-around regular.",0
"GPE was viewed as a bit of wild card heading into the 2013 Draft after PERSON surgery had wiped out his entire senior season at GPE (Ariz.) High. Intrigued by GPE's upside, the ORGANIZATION selected him in the third round and convinced him to sign for $500,000, $150,000 less than his pick value. But the right-hander experienced numbness in his arm and hand when he got back on the mound, prompting surgeons to treat him for thoracic outlet syndrome by removing one of his ribs to alleviate a pinched nerve. When his symptoms failed to improve, the right-hander had a nerve removed from his elbow.Finally healthy in 2016, GPE showed the promise that had made him a high pick while reaching full-season ball for the first time. His fastball sat between 92-95 mph and touched 97, with good plane and sinking action that makes him difficult to barrel. GPE also flashed plus with his power curveball, which registers at 75-79 mph with tight spin and late bite, and his feel for his changeup improved as he worked deeper into the season.Staying on the field will be crucial in GPE's future development, as he had logged just four pro innings prior to 2016. He's big and physical, with a frame built for eating innings, as well as stuff that could make him a No. 4 starter or late-inning reliever once fully developed.",0
"Prototypical power pitcher's frame, low-to-mid 90s fastball with projection on the body. PERSON feel for spin (supported by the class' highest measured breaking ball spin rate) but has a long way to go on the delivery and changeup. ",1
"A mainstay during the summer showcase circuit, GPE carried over solid performances into a senior season where he's performed well enough to enter into top three rounds consideration.The ORGANIZATION of GPE commit is the type of infielder whose whole is greater than the sum of his parts. He definitely can swing the bat, with a good line drive approach and the ability to make consistent contact. He should have some power, too, and homered during last summer's Tournament of PERSON. He's an average runner, though not a burner, but he covers ground as an infielder. He's played multiple positions, showing off his soft hands and accurate arm in various spots.Defensively, GPE might be best suited for second base as a regular, though given his aptitude and instincts, it wouldn't be surprising for the team that takes him to give him a chance to play his way off of shortstop.",0
"A tiny speedster, PERSON's build is relatively unprojectable, but one can still project on most of his skills because he was only taught baseball's basics while growing up in GPE, and hasn't been switch-hitting for very long. His game has some coherent small-ball elements already, as he took  quickly to bunting and putting awkward contact into play, which, because of his speed, enables him to reach against bad low-level defenses. 
There's so little power here that PERSON likely projects as a fourth outfielder, but his feel for contact is impressive for someone of his background and seemingly insufficient physicality, and if he ends up with a 6 or 7 bat, we might be talking about a regular.",0
"Though he has missed the entire season with a stress fracture in his back, PERSON still should become the first LOCATION Carolina-Upstate player ever drafted above the 15th round. Had he been healthy and proven that he could make the move from reliever to starter, he might have gone in the first two rounds.Coming out of the bullpen for the ORGANIZATION and in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON dealt 92-94 mph fastballs that reached 96. His heater is more notable for its downhill plane -- he's 6-foot-6 and uses a high three-quarter arm slot -- than its life or his command of the offering.PERSON does have enough in his arsenal to start, as he flashes a low-80s slider with some bite and a deceptive changeup. He'll have to do better job of repeating his delivery and locating his pitches, and he'll have to prove he can hold up in that role. If not, he still could be an effective late-inning weapon out of the bullpen.",0
"Wearing the ORGANIZATION. 8 jersey has become a rite of passage for PERSON's top prospects, as the last three players to wear it -- PERSON, PERSON and, most recently PERSON -- all went on to be selected in the top four rounds of the GPE. That trend continued in 2016 with PERSON, who the ORGANIZATION drafted 77th overall in GPE Round B after he batted .324/.407/.459 as a junior for the ORGANIZATION while ranking among the ORGANIZATION leaders in steals, runs, hit and triples. PERSON is well suited to bat atop a lineup, as he has a patient, contact-oriented approach and the plus speed and know-how to steal bases. His flat left-handed swing offers little in the way of power, but his on-base skills rank among the best in college baseball. PERSON has performed well during two summers in the ORGANIZATION League.The presence of 2015 second-rounder PERSON kept PERSON from manning center field before this spring, but he proved this year that he possesses the speed and instincts to at least be a solid defender there. His arm strength is below average, but it isn't considered a liability.",1
"A 39th-round pick out of an ORGANIZATION high school in 2010, PERSON turned down the ORGANIZATION in order to attend PERSON. The ORGANIZATION signed him for $50,000 as a 17th-rounder in 2013, and he has gotten off to a better start in pro ball than most members of that A's PERSON class. While his arm is his only true plus tool, he doesn't have a glaring weakness.PERSON couples a smooth left-handed swing with good patience at the plate. He has the power potential to hit 15 homers per season at his peak. He's an average runner, though he's not a basestealing threat.Since turning pro, PERSON has seen action at all three outfield spots. He has enough arm strength to play right field but the A's have deployed him mostly in left. While it remains to be seen if PERSON can develop into an everyday player at the big league level, his broad base of tools could make him a useful reserve.",0
"GPE, positionless athlete with plus bat speed and plus-plus wheels, flat swing. A developmental project.",0
"A product of the famed GPE high school program PERSON that produced big leaguers like PERSON and PERSON, PERSON's strong summer, including hitting well for PERSON, had him poised to be considered as one of the better high school bats in the country. A change in his approach, however, has hurt his performance this spring, thus dampening enthusiasm about the outfielder.Over the summer, PERSON showed plus raw power, driving balls to all fields. He's changed his setup at the plate now, with his hands into his body more, with a top-hand heavy, pull side approach. Perhaps he's trying to show more in-game power, but this spring it's resulted in a lot more swing-and-miss with no feel to go the other way. The main issue is that PERSON's carrying tool is his bat. He's acceptable in left field, but while he has solid instincts, he's not a runner. Based on his performance this spring, PERSON might not be a top three rounds candidate, which could mean he might be headed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE. But because there's some history and a track record of previous success, a team that feels they can get PERSON back to where he was last summer could roll the dice that early.Prospect ORGANIZATION - PERSON, GPE.",0
"Following a strong summer with the GPE collegiate national team, PERSON entered 2015 with a good chance to go in the first round of the GPE. But after a shoulder impingement ended his junior season at ORGANIZATION in mid-March, he dropped all the way to the fourth round. The ORGANIZATION signed him for $528,000 three years after taking him in the 21st round out of high school.At his best, PERSON can reach 97 mph with his fastball and complement it with a plus slider and solid changeup. He usually works at 89-94 mph with his fastball, which features good sink, and his secondary pitches need more consistency.If PERSON can return to full health, he could become a No. 2 starter. He does a good job of throwing strikes but will need to improve his command.",0
"PERSON was up to 95 at regionals and has an average, sweeping breaking ball that plays up against righties because of his cross-bodied delivery. That delivery might cap his ceiling in relief.",0
"Much like fellow outfield prospect PERSON, PERSON has a veritable toolchest to work with. He, too, started to figure some things out in 2014, albeit in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION.PERSON was all over the ORGANIZATION leaderboard, as the 2011 signee out of the ORGANIZATION started tapping into his considerable raw power consistently for the first time. Tall and lanky, PERSON still has room to get stronger and he started showing a better overall approach at the plate. More patience will allow him to get into better hitter's counts so he can use that extra-base pop to an even greater advantage. An above-average runner who can steal a base, PERSON has a very strong arm, making him a good fit as the prototypical athletic right fielder. He still has a long way to go, but the ORGANIZATION were encouraged by his progress and hope he builds on that as he moves up the ladder.",1
"PERSON was the consensus top prep arm in the class during his pre-draft summer and was a dominant part of ORGANIZATION USA in the fall. At that point, PERSON was commanding a lively 93-96 mph heater, a new, but already plus slider, and an at least average changeup that he didn't need to use much. He looked a little rusty early during his senior spring, then walked off the mound with tightness in a shoulder muscle tied behind the joint. He returned over a month later and threw hard down the stretch, peaking at 97 mph in multiple open workouts for scouts after his school was eliminated from the playoffs. 
He still hasn't shown the promise from the summer, as he's completely lost feel for his slider. He only threw the pitch in games last spring a handful of times and scouts speculated it made his arm hurt, but he threw it in some of the postseason workouts and simply had no feel for it anymore. At various points PERSON has utilized either a slider or curveball, and each looks good a few times a start but not often enough to project it as an impact pitch. He was noticeably thicker during the 2018 summer and continued having issues throwing quality breaking balls. Once a likely top 10 pick, he's now a bounce back hopeful.",0
"After parts of five seasons in rookie or short-season ball, and one on the shelf for a shoulder surgery, PERSON finally made his full-season debut in 2018, just a few days shy of his 24th birthday. He came back throwing fire, sitting comfortably in the 94-98 range. An imposing mound presence at a towering 6-foot-6, PERSON creates extreme downhill plane on his fastball and vertical action on his slider, which aids its vertical depth in spite of a paltry spin rate. He's understandably behind due to his limited pro workload, but he's a candidate for quick promotion before he breaks again, and seems like a potential set-up type if the slider improves now that PERSON is finally pitching and developing again.",0
"The ORGANIZATION made a run at signing PERSON out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks in 2013, but he chose to attend the FACILITY. His performance was garnering attention and when it seemed likely that his active duty requirement was going to be deferred, the son of former ORGANIZATION offensive lineman PERSON began moving up boards in a hurry.A three-year starter at FACILITY, PERSON has really put it together as a junior, showing glimpses of four usable pitches. His fastball will come in anywhere from the 89-95 mph range and he maintains his velocity deep into his starts while commanding it well with a very quick arm. His best secondary pitch is his changeup, showing a good feel for the offspeed pitch. His slider and curve can come and go at times, looking PERSON average at times and looking below-average in other instances.Those who have seen enough flashes of the breaking stuff think PERSON can definitely start at the next level. Those teams will be the ones strongly considering the right-hander in the top three or four rounds.",0
"After dealing with PERSON surgery and thoracic outlet syndrome while at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, facing pro hitters late in games may seem like a walk in the park to PERSON, the ORGANIZATION' sixth-round pick in the 2014 Draft. After a strong first full season and showing in the ORGANIZATION in 2016, PERSON pitched his way from Double-A to the big leagues and led the system in saves. He spent most of the 2018 season in Triple-A, though he did return to GPE, and was sent to the ORGANIZATION in January in a Minor League deal.The ORGANIZATION did give PERSON the chance to start at the outset of his career, but it's clear the back end of the bullpen, where his fastball-slider combination plays up, is the place for him. He creates angle with his 6-foot-4 frame well, leading to weak contact off of his 94- to 98-mph fastball, though he also misses bats with it up in the zone. His slider has improved to the point of being a true out pitch with hard two-plane break. He's not a big command guy, and while he threw enough strikes previously in his career, his control regressed in 2018.PERSON wasn't able to establish himself as a Major League reliever with the ORGANIZATION. He gets a fresh start with the ORGANIZATION and if he can rediscover the strike zone, he still has the chance to pitch in high-leverage situations in the back end of a bullpen.",1
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 28, 2017 - PERSON, Fla.Favorite MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON is a highly touted prospect who was recruited by PERSON, PERSON and ORGANIZATION before choosing to commit to PERSON. The shortstop was selected as a member of the 2016 ORGANIZATION First Team and participated in the 2016 ORGANIZATION. What stands out the most to scouts is his ability to play defense. The athletic high school infielder has a glove to carry him. He has the looks of a solid future defender with quick feet and has showed the ability to glide to the ball, always ending up in position to make a play. At the plate, he's a contact hitter with a downhill swing and average batspeed. PERSON note that it's clear he likes to be on the field and that he is a hustler when it comes to making plays.",0
"After PERSON, who signed with the ORGANIZATION for just $105,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2012, had a huge GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2014, he was pushed aggressively to full-season ball in 2015. That didn't go so well, but the toolsy outfielder righted himself following a move down to the GPE League.While the demotion may have slowed his timetable a bit, it could be a very positive step in his development in terms of learning to harness his natural ability. PERSON is extremely athletic with plus speed that he uses on both sides of the ball. He should be a solid defensive center fielder and a basestealing threat. While he doesn't have a ton of home run power, he does have considerable strength, particularly in his wrists and forearms and could eventually reach double-digits in that offensive category.Outfielders in the ORGANIZATION system unfairly get compared to the late PERSON, who reached Double-A at age 20. PERSON is still ahead of the curve at that age for the entire 2016 season and has the chance to jump back on a faster track.",1
"After signing for $40,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2013, PERSON spent his first two season as a pro in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION planned on easing him into the GPE last year with time in extended spring training and an assignment to the Rookie-level PERSON. Instead he forced his way onto the low Class A Great Lakes roster in late April and earned a promotion to high Class A Rancho Cucamonga two months later, holding his own at both stops at age 19.Though PERSON had a rough return to the GPE League in 2016, he still has the chance to have at least average tools across the board. He's strong, has a quick right-handed bat and shows some feel for hitting, but he'll need to improve his plate discipline. He's an average runner who plays faster than that on the bases and in the outfield.PERSON logged time at all three outfield spots in 2015, seeing his most action in center field. He lacks the pure speed for the position but his instincts give him a chance to stick there. If he must move to a corner, his strong arm grades as his best tool and easily would fit in right field.",0
"PERSON's brothers, PERSON and PERSON, were former eighth-round picks. Another of PERSON' sons, PERSON was considered a better prospect than his older siblings and he proved it this spring. Fully healthy (he had PERSON surgery and spent 2016 as a DH at GPE), GPE was the Big 12 Conference Player of the Year and was a ORGANIZATION finalist, finishing his junior campaign with a .351/.444/.726 line and 24 home runs in 65 games. The ORGANIZATION took him at the start of the third round that June, signed him for $600,000, then watched as GPE hit his way up to Class A Advanced Lakeland during his pro debut. GPE stands out for his left-handed power as well as the gritty makeup that enables him to get the most out of his otherwise average tools and skills. He worked to get stronger and to turn on and pull more pitches, increasing his game power without sacrificing his ability to control the strike zone and grind out quality at-bats. The power output is new, as GPE totaled just 10 home runs in his first two years at GPE before erupting as a junior, though scouts do believe he could be a .260 hitter who hits 20 homers annually when all is said and done. A below-average runner, GPE compensates for his lack of speed and fringy range at second base with tremendous instincts and smart positioning. He's a reliable defender at the keystone, with good hands and enough arm strength to make all the routine plays.",0
"Some college catchers have excellent bats, but the jury is out about whether they can stay behind the plate. PERSON is the opposite, a sure-fire backstop defensively who will have to prove he can hit at the next level. A hamate injury that kept him out for a chunk of the 2017 season didn't help matters, though he did return as the GPE approached.PERSON has serious defensive skills behind the plate. He's the kind of take charge player teams like to see from the position. He works with pitchers well, has good hands and catch-and-throw skills. There's a reason he was chosen to catch for the GPE National Team both as a high schooler, when he hit well, and last summer for the ORGANIZATION, where he didn't swing the bat effectively. There is some pop in his bat, but it is definitely behind the defensive tools.When healthy, PERSON pushed teammate JJ Schwarz from behind the plate because of his superior defensive skills. He profiles as a future defensive-minded backup, but a team that thinks he can hit just enough to be a glove-first regular might consider him in the top six rounds.",0
"PERSON is a true 80 runner that doesn't have the hands or consistency to play in the infield long term, so his speed can play in the outfield. He has plus bat speed and a chance to hit 15-18 homers at his peak, but his season was ended by a broken hamate bone and he may be a tough sign in this range.",0
"The ORGANIZATION State product had a very successful first full season of pro ball, finishing fourth in the organization in ORGANIZATION, third in strikeouts and batting average against, as well as second in GPE, despite not dominating quite as much after a late promotion to the ORGANIZATION State League. He was unable to build off of that as a strained flexor tendon in his elbow shelved him in 2015.PERSON might be undersized at 5-foot-11, but he has a huge arm. The right-hander will typically sit in the low-90s, but he can reach back for a lot more, touching the upper-90s at times when healthy. He combines that with an above-average slider that's an out pitch, especially against right-handed hitters, and while his changeup isn't as good, it's an effective third offering. Despite the big velocity, PERSON is around the plate, walking less than two per nine innings in 2014. His size had many thinking he'd be relegated to the bullpen, where his power stuff would likely play up a tick or two, and his elbow ailment will surely add to that speculation. He does have the stuff, and the demeanor, to finish games as a reliever.",0
"A 12th-round pick from GPE who signed for $100,000 in the 2016 Draft, PERSON was largely a reliever in college. After a stunning pro debut pitching out of the bullpen, he moved into the rotation in 2017, finishing fourth in the system in strikeouts and sixth in ORGANIZATION, then moved up to Double-A, where he finished off a playoff no-hitter. His development is now in the hands of the D-backs, who acquired him in a three-team trade in February that sent PERSON to GPE York.PERSON's velocity ticked up at the start of his pro career, with his fastball jumping up to 93-97 mph. He continues to work on the consistency of his mid-80s slider and he's worked to refine his changeup and has had success with it. His stuff held up all year in his first full pro season and while making the transition from reliever to starter, though the ORGANIZATION kept him on a tight pitch limit. High spin rates on his fastball and breaking ball led to a lot of missed bats in 2017.PERSON has an athletic delivery that he can repeat well, which should lead to solid control. He had ulnar transposition surgery on his pitching elbow in the fall of 2015 and also missed time with back and knee issues in college, but he proved to be durable over 27 starts in 2017. Even if he returns to the bullpen, he could be a valuable arm for the D-backs in the future.",0
"PERSON is strong and athletic and has a mature body for his age. He could be the first position player in his class to make it to the big leagues because he has all of the tools scouts love to see in emerging young prospects and he's able to use them in games.At the plate, the teen has a smooth, short and compact swing with excellent bat speed from both sides of the plate. He has shown good bat control and can drive the ball into the gaps and hit for power to all fields. PERSON squares up the ball and has an advanced approach with a good understanding of the strike zone. The ball jumps off of his bat. He's also a smart baserunner with good speed. He's known for getting good leads and a quick first jump. He normally runs the timed 60-yard run in 6.3 to 6.5 seconds.On defense, PERSON has shown good footwork and soft hands, and he takes good routes. He has a strong arm and his balls carry on line until they reach the destination. He loves the sport and has a reputation for being a ""baseball rat"" who is always working on a different part of his game. Questions about his projectability are answered by his current tool set across the board and ""now"" body and abilities.PERSON trains with PERSON in the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION are the favorites to sign him.",0
"  PERSON started the 2013 season strong at ORGANIZATION A Bowling Green and was selected to the ORGANIZATION. But he was injured before he could appear in the event and eventually had to undergo PERSON surgery. He missed almost all of the 2014 season as a result, though started to show why he was a first-round pick in 2015.Now healthy, PERSON is showing the same kind of electric stuff that made him a a top Draft prospect out of high school. He throws his fastball in the low-to mid 90s, with late sinking action. His curveball has good depth, giving it has the makings of an out pitch. He made strides with his changeup, giving him three average-or-better offerings. PERSON appears to have put the surgery, and a 50-game suspension for a ""drug of abuse,"" behind him. Still just 22, he has time on his side to reach his ceiling as a big league starter.",0
"Trapped in the ORGANIZATION market's penalty box after their 2016 Cuban shopping spree, the Cardinals were still able to find some interesting $300,000 talent in each of the following two years. NuÃ±ez is the best hitter of that bunch and he posted god-like numbers in the ORGANIZATION last year, slashing .415/.497/.774 with 31 extra-base hits in 44 games. Already to be taken with a healthy grain of salt, ORGANIZATION numbers are often faulty when the prospect in question is more physically mature than his peers, and the hefty NuÃ±ez is a classic case. He will likely need to move to first base, perhaps even while he's still in the minors, putting a ton of pressure on his admittedly prodigious bat to fully actualize. There's not much physical projection here, so the raw power NuÃ±ez currently has is pretty close to what he'll have at peak, meaning the bat-to-ball component is what will drive his stock going forward.",0
"GPE is one of the top prep right-handers in the 2017 GPE, and definitely the most traveled. After going from GPE (ORGANIZATION) Heritage as a freshman to ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION) GPE as a sophomore to Prestonwood GPE (GPE, ORGANIZATION) as a junior, he hoped to transfer to GPE (ORGANIZATION) for his final season. When ORGANIZATION' ORGANIZATION nixed that idea, he returned to GPE Heritage and won PERSON's state player of the year award.Scouts aren't sure what to make of the constant transferring, but they don't quibble with his fastball and his frame. His fastball jumped from the high 80s during the summer of 2015 to a consistent 93-95 mph with a peak of 97 a year later, and he has hit 98 and held his velocity deep into games this spring. He attributes the improvement to better conditioning, as his heater took off once he dropped 40 pounds.GPE has one of the best changeups in the high school ranks, throwing it with deceptive arm speed and fade and earning plus grades from some evaluators, but there's still some question about his feel to spin a reliable breaking pitch. The ORGANIZATION A&M recruit doesn't have the most fluid delivery, which sometimes affects his control and leads to some debate over whether he'll be a starter or reliever at the big league level, and he's also one of the oldest high schoolers in this year's crop (19 years, four months on GPE day).",0
"After spending his freshman year at ORGANIZATION (Calif.), PERSON transferred to PERSON and became the highest-drafted player in GPE history, when he went in 2014's seventh round after going 11-0 with a 1.68 ERA as a sophomore. PERSON surpassed PERSON when the ORGANIZATION took him in the fourth round this June, but the latter still has the chance to become PERSON's first big leaguer. He threw 7 1/3 shutout innings to win the clincher in the high Class A GPE League playoffs to cap his first full pro season and swiftly climbed to Triple-A in his second.PERSON lived off a sinker that sat around 90 mph in college and has ticked up to 92-93 mph in pro ball, now topping out at 96. His fastball plays better than its average velocity thanks to its heavy life. He has feel for a changeup that can become at least an average No. 2 pitch, and he also can mix in a slider and a cutter that sometimes blend together.PERSON pounds the bottom of the strike zone, and though he doesn't miss a lot of bats, he has what it takes to be an efficient workhorse starter. He has bounced back from PERSON surgery in high school to put himself in position to serve the ORGANIZATION as a back-of-the-rotation or middle-relief option.",0
"After slipping to the fourth round of the 2013 Draft following a bit of a tumultuous senior season of high school, the ORGANIZATION brought PERSON along slowly in his first year and change of pro ball. Then, in 2015, he exploded on the scene, finishing third in the Minors in ORGANIZATION and fifth in batting average against. PERSON was particularly dominant in the first half while in the ORGANIZATION, learning what he needed to work on upon his promotion to the ORGANIZATION State League, as his fastball command and aggressiveness on the mound weren't quite what they were during the first half. The projectable lefty has the chance to have a plus fastball and changeup when all is said and done. His curveball has improved with added power and he continues to work on a slider that could give him a second usable breaking ball. As he continues to physically mature and improve his mechanics, there's the chance there's more in the tank.During the offseason, the ORGANIZATION may have received more inquiries from other teams about PERSON than just about any prospect in the system, with his projectability, feel for pitching and left-handedness making him a very hot commodity.",1
"Though GPE (GPE) PERSON has sent more than two dozen players to college programs, it never has had a player drafted before the 20th round. That should change in 2018, as the ORGANIZATION have a pair of potential first-rounders in GPE and right-hander PERSON. GPE is one of the better all-around hitters in the prep class and doesn't have a glaring weakness.GPE has a quick right-handed stroke and has a track record of catching up to and punishing quality fastballs on the showcase circuit. With his strength, balance and mature approach, he makes consistent hard line-drive contact. Once he fills out his rangy 6-foot-4 frame and adds some loft to his swing, he could have plus power.An average runner out of the batter's box and quicker once he gets going, GPE is athletic for his size but won't stay at shortstop after he leaves GPE. His solid arm will play anywhere in the infield, where he probably fits best at third base but may have a chance to stick up the middle at second, and he has the makeup to get the most out of his ability. If he attends college, he'll reunite with his brother PERSON at ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON viewed PERSON as a tough sign heading into the 2012 Draft due to his commitment to play football at LOCATION. However, the ORGANIZATION took a gamble in the third round and landed him with a $750,000 signing bonus. PERSON spent much of the next three years focused on his football career, playing one season as LOCATION' quarterback before transferring to GPE and playing defensive back, before finally giving up the sport last offseason.Though he chose to pursue football, PERSON continued to play for the ORGANIZATION each summer and logged 25 games between the 2012-14 seasons. That made his performance in 2015 all the more impressive, as PERSON transformed from a raw athlete into a surprisingly well-rounded and polished ballplayer in his first full season, hitting .298/.398/.421 with 27 steals and 13.8 percent walk rate in 107 games across both Class A levels. That he hasn't come close to repeating that level of production in 2016 has more to do with PERSON's health than his abilities, as he made two separate trips to the disabled list for a knee injury and a concussion, respectively. PERSON stands out for his top-flight athleticism and physical tools, but it's his mature feel for the game that has scouts excited about his ceiling as a top-of-the-order hitter who can stick in center field. PERSON's plus-plus speed is a weapon on the basepaths as well as in the outfield. The right-handed hitter has some swing-and-miss to his game but makes a lot of hard contact and consistently works deep counts, and his combination of natural hitting ability and a patient approach should help him tap into more power going forward.",1
"GPE received the highest bonus in the ORGANIZATION' 2011 international crop, signing for $350,000 out of the ORGANIZATION. He pitched a career-low 51 1/3 innings last year, the result of a 50-game suspension for testing positive for stimulants and a bout with shoulder tendinitis, but pitched well enough in Double-A and the ORGANIZATION to earn a spot on PERSON's 40-man roster. GPE earned a midseason promotion to Triple-A then was acquired by the ORGANIZATION for PERSON in late July.GPE often pitches in the low 90s and tops out at 95 with sink and tail on his fastball, though at times he'll dip down to the upper 80s. His slider and changeup can be solid pitches on occasion, and he has the aptitude to vary the break on his slider. He also can mix in a curveball for show. There isn't much effort in GPE's delivery, and he's doing a better job of repeating it and maintaining the quality of his stuff and command. He'll need to watch his conditioning because his 6-foot-3 frame carries a lot more than his listed 195 pounds. He most likely will fit in the ORGANIZATION. 4 slot in a big league rotation.",1
"PERSON went 77th overall in 2016, in the comp round after the second round. That's right around the range in the draft where the college hitters come with some warts and project more as role players than potential regulars. PERSON was a plus runner who projected in center field as an amateur but he has lost a step in pro ball and profiles as more of a tweener now, with offensive skills that don't overwhelm, so the outcome is most likely bench outfielder of some stripe. There's a shot he can stay healthy, add some loft to his swing, maintain some contact skills, and end up as a ORGANIZATION Gamel-esque soft 50 FV for a couple seasons, but he's more likely to fall in the ORGANIZATION or PERSON region where a swing change ensures a big league role. 
PERSON acquired PERSON from the ORGANIZATION, their best friend from trade camp, in the PERSON Zunino/Mallex Smith swap this winter. PERSON lined up, as PERSON was looking for cheap potential ORGANIZATION contributors in the next season or two, and PERSON has a never-ending 40-man crunch to manage.",1
"GPE plate discipline and enough hitting tools made PERSON attractive, but he's a maxed-out 1B-only prospect that only shows 50 raw power right now.",0
"A.J. PERSON might have been the more ""famous"" ORGANIZATION of GPE starter, but it was PERSON who was the ORGANIZATION' Friday night starter for all three years of his college career. He was named the 2016 ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year after going 12-1 with a 2.31 ERA in 18 starts. The A's ended up adding both GPE hurlers to its system day one of the draft, selecting PERSON in the first round and PERSON in the second. PERSON and durable, PERSON is a strike-throwing machine with a potential three-pitch mix. He typically works with an average fastball velocity-wise, but it plays up because of his command. His best pitch is his changeup, which he locates and sinks extremely well. Even when hitters know it's coming, he still gets outs. PERSON's breaking ball is slurvy and a bit inconsistent. When it's on, however, it can be virtually unhittable and has the potential of being a third Major League average offering.Though he's more about pitchability than stuff, PERSON's track record in the ultra-competitive ORGANIZATION speaks for itself. The lack of an explosive fastball limits his ceiling, but there's certainly a lot to like in a college performer who should be quick to the big leagues as a back-end starter.",0
"  The GPE have challenged PERSON in each of his three professional seasons, and the precocious catcher has been among the youngest players in his league every time. He has more than held his own against the older competition and earned All-Star honors in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in 2014. PERSON has a good feel for hitting and consistently makes hard contact from both sides of the plate. His bat speed gives him good raw power, and he may develop more as he physically matures. He is still improving defensively, and the GPE want him to improve his GPE and game-calling skills, but he has the tools to develop into an everyday catcher in time. PERSON has as much upside as anyone in the organization, and the GPE have had success developing catchers in recent years. But he is still just a teenager and remains a long way from the ORGANIZATION.",1
"PERSON was the consensus top prep arm in the class this summer, dominating hitters and peaking with PERSON in the fall. At that point, PERSON was commanding a lively 93-96 mph heater, a new, but already plus slider and at least and average changeup that he didn't need much. He came out of the gates this spring a little rusty then walked off the mound with shoulder tightness tied to a muscle behind the joint. He returned over a month later and has been good down the stretch, peaking at 97 mph in multiple open workouts for scouts after his school was eliminated from the playoffs. He still hasn't shown the promise from the summer, as he's completely lost feel for his slider. He only threw the pitch in games this spring a handful of times and scouts speculated it made his arm hurt, but he threw it in some of the postseason workouts and simply had no feel for the pitch anymore.

The curveball that replaced it is similar to PERSON's curveball and is often a 45 or 50, maybe a 55 once a start but not often enough to project it as such. He's healthy, teams are clearing his medical and the arm speed is back, but his frame is now maxed-out and it's unclear where his breaking ball went and if it will come back. He's seen as very signable and the team that takes him will be banking on him returning to form; we've assumed there's a little more slider feel that will be teased out but not the 60 pitch of the summer.",0
"Undrafted out of high school because he had PERSON surgery, PERSON pitched largely in relief as a freshman at GPE, then moved into the weekend rotation behind 2017 first-rounder PERSON. A strong ORGANIZATION Cod League showing last summer catapulted him into the Friday night role for the ORGANIZATION, where he's had a bit of an up-and-down season.At his best, PERSON stands out with his arm strength and power arsenal. His fastball will typically sit around 92-93 mph, but he can reach back for more, flashing a plus 97-mph heater at times, both on the ORGANIZATION and occasionally this spring, and he does maintain his velocity throughout starts. His secondary stuff, however, has backed up some. In the past, he'd show a short, quick, deep breaking ball with late break at the plate. It's been more of a slurvy pitch this spring with more of a loopy break to it, leading to hitters laying off of it and sitting on what is a largely true fastball. He has a changeup, but doesn't throw it much.While he does largely throw strikes, PERSON does need to refine his command within the zone. That, plus some effort in his delivery, has some scouts predicting a future in the bullpen, though with his ability to maintain his fastball, he could get the opportunity to start at the outset of his pro career.",0
"Signed for $2.475 million as the 12th overall pick in the 2012 Draft, PERSON played well in high Class A at the end of that summer -- which might have been the worst thing for him. The FACILITY sent him back to that level for his first full pro season, and he responded by recording the lowest batting average (.178) and most strikeouts (160 in 383 at-bats) in the ORGANIZATION. When he returned there again in 2014, he was able to slow the game down and topped the ORGANIZATION with 84 RBIs.After tasting failure for the first time, PERSON responded with a more balanced and disciplined approach and did a better job of recognizing pitches. His right-handed swing looked smoother and handsier than ever, and he didn't get consumed by trying to hit homers. He may chase too many pitches to ever hit for a high average but he now has a better chance of translating his bat speed and strength into plus power. A solid runner who played center field in his first two pro seasons, PERSON moved to left field last year. He needs to improve his defensive focus after leading ORGANIZATION outfielders with 14 errors. He has a plus arm in high school but it plays closer to average now.",0
" Twenty-one years after the ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON from PERSON, the club picked PERSON out of the same GPE school. In 2014, he hit 22 home runs with PERSON, tied for the most in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON produces plenty of raw power and does a good job of getting to it in games. While his pop comes with its share of strikeouts, his approach has improved in the ORGANIZATION. He's willing to take a walk, and looks to hit the ball the other way more often. Big, right-handed hitting first basemen face some challenges, but the ORGANIZATION have had success with PERSON, who also fits that profile. PERSON is an adequate defender, but, as with PERSON, it'll be up to his bat to carry him to the big leagues.",0
"The 2014 Conference USA player of the year after hitting .368/.442/.626, PERSON went in the second round and signed for $1.1 million that June as a catcher with offensive potential. He didn't do much at the plate in his first three pro seasons -- fracturing bones in his face when he got hit by a knee while trying to break up a double play in 2016 didn't help -- but has started to drive the ball more consistently this year.PERSON's strength and the loft in his right-handed swing could translate into 15 homers per year at the big league level. He makes consistent contact but hasn't shown the same plate discipline he did at ORGANIZATION, so he may not hit for a high average. His offensive package profiles well enough to be a big league regular as a catcher, though he's hopelessly blocked in GPE Francisco by PERSON GPE.PERSON's arm has gotten stronger and his release has gotten quicker since he has turned pro, and he recorded the best pop times (1.85 seconds) in the ORGANIZATION during the offseason. His receiving and blocking have improved as well. He has gotten some time at first base this year, enhancing his versatility if he winds up a backup to GPE.",0
"For the second time in six GPE, scouts are flocking to see a left-hander at GPE (Ill.) High. PERSON landed late third-round money ($426,000) after dropping to the 15th round because he needed PERSON surgery. PERSON hasn't had any health issues and could go in the top five rounds this June as clearly the top prospect in the state of Illinois.PERSON usually operates at 88-91 mph and tops out at 93 with his fastball. He commands it well, generates some armside run and should have a plus heater once his 6-foot-4 frame adds muscle. He does a good job of selling his fading changeup, which shows signs of becoming a plus pitch.PERSON exhibits much more feel for his changeup than his slurvy breaking ball. It's more of a soft curveball at this point, and he may be better off working with a harder slider in the future. More strong than athletic, the ORGANIZATION State recruit repeats his delivery and lives in the strike zone.",0
"PERSON's power potential was evident when he was an GPE high schooler, but he lasted until the ORGANIZATION took him in the 34th round of the 2015 Draft because he was coming off PERSON surgery and had a firm commitment to GPE. He played in just 41 games during his first two college seasons while dealing with the effects of multiple concussions. Finally healthy, he has broken out in a big way in 2018, leading ORGANIZATION Division I in slugging (.944) and ORGANIZATION (1.456) and all D-I Draft-eligible players in homers (22) through the end of the regular season.PERSON's 6-foot-5, 210-pound build gives him strength and leverage, which combined with his solid bat speed produces prodigious raw power. A right-handed hitter, he excels at crushing the balls to the opposite field, though some scouts wonder how he'll have the same success against quality inside fastballs in pro ball. His size adds length to his swing and his aggressiveness leads to strikeouts, so he'll hit more for power than average at the next level.Though he plays first base for the GPE, PERSON is a good athlete for his size and should be capable of playing the outfield corners. He has average speed and will flash solid run times on occasion, and his arm earns similar grades. The best-case scenario is that he profiles as a right fielder.",0
"PERSON has shown some of the best stuff in the system ever since the ORGANIZATION made him the first pitcher they selected in the 2015 Draft and signed him for an over-slot $320,000 in the sixth round. But he saw his first two pro seasons end prematurely because of a recurring stress fracture in his elbow and also missed the first three weeks of the 2018 season. PERSON shifted him to the bullpen in order to keep him healthy, and he not only stayed on the mound but also posted the best numbers of his career.PERSON had four legitimate pitches as a starter but focuses on two as a reliever. His upper-80s cutter is his bread and butter, and he plays it off a 92-95 mph fastball that can hit 97 with some modest life. His downer curveball showed flashes of becoming a plus offering when he used it more in the past season, and his fading changeup had its moments as well.Working in shorter stints, PERSON demonstrates better control and command than he did as a starter. He has a strong, athletic frame and a sound delivery, so he should be durable, but the ORGANIZATION didn't have him pitch on consecutive days in 2018. He proved he could handle a heavier bullpen workload this year and made his big league debut in April.",0
"The ORGANIZATION doubled up on GPE prep hurlers in the 2014 Draft, taking left-hander PERSON in the first round followed by PERSON in the 12th. While PERSON was the more highly touted prospect at that time, it's been PERSON who has enjoyed the most success as a pro. He impressed during his full-season debut in the Class A ORGANIZATION and built on that performance in 2017 Class A Advanced GPE, posting a 2.51 ERA that paced all GPE League hurlers with at least 100 innings pitched. With PERSON's arrow pointing in the right direction, the ORGANIZATION acquired him, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON from PERSON for outfielder PERSON. PERSON has seen his stuff and overall pitchability improve in each of his four seasons. He compensates for being undersized with a high-spin-rate fastball that sits 89-93 mph and induces whiffs in and above the zone. PERSON's breaking ball is his best secondary pitch, flashing plus at times with late downer action, and he exhibits feel for a promising changeup. His entire arsenal plays up because he's a good strike-thrower, though he's likely to be challenged in that regarded against upper-level hitters.PERSON's swing-and-miss fastball, combined with his two average-or-better secondary offerings, gives him a chance to be successful against hitters on both sides of the plate, which he was in 2017. That he's an undersized righty who lacks a plus pitch leads some to peg PERSON as a future reliever, but he's passed every test in his career thus far.",1
"Despite playing with a right hand injury eventually diagnosed as a broken hamate bone, PERSON led PERSON to its first-ever ORGANIZATION USA regular-season title in 2016, earning league player-of-the-year and defensive-player-of-the-year recognition along the way. The first college shortstop drafted in 2016 and the highest pick in school history, he went 51st overall and signed for $1.1 million. His hamate injury hampered him early in his debut but he hit .320 with four homers in his final two weeks, and then he missed most of the first three months of the 2017 season with repeated hamstring issues.Taller than most shortstops at 6-foot-4 and possessing just average speed, PERSON nevertheless should be able to stick at the position. His quick first step and his instincts enhance his range, and he has the strong, accurate arm to make any throw necessary. If he does have to move, he has enough bat to still profile as a regular at second base.PERSON has a track record of making consistent contact and could produce solid batting averages if he improves his patience at the plate. He has more raw power than the typical shortstop, thanks to the leverage in his right-handed swing, and should be good for double-digit home runs and plenty of doubles on an annual basis. He's not a threat to steal but runs the bases well.",0
"GPE PERSON had a string of first rounders -- PERSON and PERSON in 2009, PERSON in 2010 and PERSON in 2011 -- broken in 2012, but PERSON looks like a good bet to get the ORGANIZATION back in the top 30 picks.A big, strong left-handed-hitting third baseman, PERSON has good projection to his frame, meaning heâs likely to grow into more power as he matures. Heâs a polished hitter, one who stood out on the GPE this past summer, and he should be able to stay at the hot corner defensively.In his second straight summer in the GPE, PERSON led the summer circuit in ORGANIZATION with 42 and played in his second consecutive GPE Cod League All-Star Game, where he went 1-for-5.He may not go as high as his uncle, former No. 1 overall pick B.J. PERSON, but he should be one of the earlier college bats to come off the board.",1
"PERSON GPE has had five outfielders selected in the top three rounds of the past six GPE, and PERSON should go in the same territory in June. A semi-regular as a freshman and a left fielder in deference to gifted defender PERSON on the ORGANIZATION' 2015 College World Series team, he's the center fielder and offensive catalyst on their '16 squad.PERSON is well suited to bat atop a lineup, as he has a patient contact-oriented approach and the plus speed and know-how to steal bases. His flat left-handed swing doesn't yield much power, but his on-base skills rank among the best in college baseball. PERSON has performed well during two summers in the ORGANIZATION League.Though he hadn't played much center field for ORGANIZATION before this spring, PERSON's speed and instincts make him at least a solid defender there. His arm strength is below average, but it isn't considered a liability.",1
"As GPE struck out more and more during his final few seasons as a shortstop, he frequently appeared despondent, sullen, and visibly affected by his struggles in ways that were often obvious and concerning. He struck out in at least 30% of his at-bats every year since the ORGANIZATION acquired him from GPE as part of the ORGANIZATION deal. While his defensive actions remained enticing (they were, especially around the bag, some of the smoothest and quickest some scouts had ever seen), GPE also became error-prone. He seemed a mess, a potential ORGANIZATION candidate. 
This spring, GPE has moved to the mound. His first bullpen session, which took place in front of a very small contingent of ORGANIZATION front office folks, was electric. The first fastball was clocked by PERSON at 97 mph, and a few fastballs later, GPE touched 100.4 mph. He has been working, an inning at a time, twice a week in GPE Spring Training. PERSON saw him shortly before publication, and he was 95-98 with natural cut at times (in the linked video you can see how his fastball's spin axis is somewhat slidery) and had pretty impressive slider feel for someone who has only been pitching for a few weeks. He'll likely head out to an affiliate in the next week or so (probably PERSON). GPE seems comfortable and confident on the mound, and he's going right at hitters with that fastball. He'll move as quickly as his strike-throwing and slider allow him to, and PERSON has incentive to move him along because GPE is on the 40-man. We may see him on the mound at ORGANIZATION this season.",1
" A strong finish to his junior season at ORGANIZATION helped PERSON move into the sandwich round. He has a live arm that can deliver fastballs up to 97 mph, and he has a slider that should be a very good secondary pitch in the future. PERSON has a changeup, but itâs behind the fastball-breaking ball combination. Heâs not the biggest guy in the world and has had some command issues in the past, though not during his summer debut in the ORGANIZATION. With his power stuff and size, some see a future in the bullpen, but the ORGANIZATION sent him out as a starter and may give him the chance to stick in a rotation for the time being.",1
"PERSON is very polished for a prep pitcher, and it showed when he spun three consecutive no-hitters in March and April, three shy of the national high school record. He may not get drafted high enough to lure him away from a commitment to GPE, where he could make an immediate impact as a freshman.PERSON's pitchability stands out more than his pure stuff, though he does have a pair of solid pitches in his fastball and slider. He works from 87-91 mph with his heater, which features some riding life, and he can throw his slider for strikes or use it as a chase pitch. His changeup will need more work.He's a good athlete who does a nice job of repeating his easy, balanced delivery, though scouts wonder how much more velocity PERSON has in the tank. He's not extremely physical and lacks standout arm speed. Should he attend college, he'll be Draft-eligible as a sophomore in 2018.",0
"An offensive lineman in high school, ORGANIZATION lost a ton of weight to get in baseball shape. That helped him reach the fourth round of the 2014 Draft. The down side of that transformation was that he tired during his first full season of pro ball, though there is a good amount of offensive upside to be had here.ORGANIZATION had primarily played third as a pro heading into 2016, though he mixed in some first. That's where he played nearly exclusively during the 2016 season. He's a below-average fielder at both corner infield spots.In the end, though, it will be ORGANIZATION's bat that carries him up the ladder. Finding that happy medium between too slimmed down and offensive lineman should help him reach his offensive ceiling.",0
"It's growing more difficult to reconcile PERSON' obvious physical tool with his complete lack of performance, even though he has been young for his level since his pro debut. He put on a show during PERSON (though, somewhat suspiciously, everyone did), he has visually evident feel for contact supported by his lower strikeout rates, he runs well-enough to stay in center field. But in three pro seasons now he's hitting a collective .253/.315/.351 and it's starting to make teams antsy. When we passed around initial drafts of our Top 100, all but one source providing feedback on PERSON' ranking told us to move him down, some indicating he should be off, entirely. We still think he'd go somewhere in the first round were he draft eligible and that he has everyday tools, but so far as his stock throughout the industry is concerned, the clock is certainly ticking.",0
"PERSON electrified ORGANIZATION fans in 2012, when he did a backflip on ORGANIZATION right after getting drafted 13th overall and played well at two Class A stops at the end of his debut. He still shows glimpses of the high ceiling that earned him a $2,475,000 bonus but has struggled for much of his four full pro seasons. In the last two years in Double-A, he has had trouble making consistent contact and missed time with finger, foot and oblique injuries.PERSON' bat speed and strength give him jaw-dropping raw power, but it remains to be seen whether he'll be polished enough as a hitter to make the most of it. His right-handed swing can get out of control at times and his plate discipline regressed in 2015 after improving the year before. He may never hit for a high average but could produce 25 or more homers per year at GPE Cellular Field if he can refine his approach.Coming out of high school, PERSON had solid speed and arm strength. He since has lost a step as he has matured physically and his throwing motion is a bit stiff, so he now fits best in left field after playing primarily in center field in his first two pro seasons.",0
"A one-time Miami area high school standout who tripled off of current ORGANIZATION power-hitting prospect PERSON at ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION, PERSON is one of those players whose whole exceeds the sum of his parts.None of PERSON's tools jump off the page, yet the ORGANIZATION thought enough of his makeup and instincts to send him to the ORGANIZATION in 2014 at age 20. While it might look like he lacks the arm strength to stay at shortstop, he tends to make up for any deficiencies with outstanding fundamentals, with excellent footwork, a quick release and an accuracy. His solid-average defense is ahead of his offense as of now. He has a line drive approach and uses the whole field, is a solid bunter and runs well. He needs to improve his approach at the plate and work counts more, but given his baseball smarts, that should come with time and experience.PERSON is still way ahead of the curve in terms of age and the level he's playing at. His feel for the game and natural confidence should continue to allow him to play above his tools.",0
"PERSON is still a under-the-radar as a prospect: he wasn't a top pedigree amateur prospect, signing for $300,000 when the ORGANIZATION were in the international penalty box, and has only played in the ORGANIZATION as a very limited participant in instructional league. He made quite an impression on the scouts who have been able to see him for his loud tools: plus batspeed, running speed, and arm strength, along with a chance to stick at shortstop. PERSON has put on about 20 pounds since signing, with one scout comparing his frame and toolset to PERSON's, though the skills and feel for the game are obviously not even close to that. He also has a good plate approach but can play out of control at times, especially at shortstop. PERSON likely will head to ORGANIZATION in 2019 at age 19.",0
"GPE has a great swing and thunderous raw power. He also went from having one of the worst approaches in baseball last year to having an average one. We don't think he fits at third base, but his stock is up as we're more confident he'll have the offensive skills to profile in left field.",0
"GPE homered 10 times in his final 16 games at ORGANIZATION, winning LOCATION tournament ORGANIZATION honors after going deep five times in five days, including a three-homer game against GPE. He finished with 20 homers after totaling six in his first two years with the ORGANIZATION, bashing his way into the sixth round of the 2017 Draft. After signing for $260,200, GPE homered in three of his first four games as a pro.As a first baseman with big left-handed power along with swing-and-miss concerns, GPE earns comparisons to a poor man's PERSON. With his bat speed and the size and leverage his 6-foot-3, 235-pound frame provides, he can crush the ball out of any part of the park. While GPE may never hit for a high average, he has shown a greater willingness to use the entire field and has made more contact in 2017.All of GPE's value comes from his bat. A high school catcher who played some right field as an ORGANIZATION sophomore, he'll be limited to first base as a pro because of his well-below-average speed. GPE can become an adequate defender but will need to improve his consistency.",0
"GPE high schools haven't produced a big leaguer since PERSON, who the ORGANIZATION drafted in the second round in 2002, but PERSON should end that drought if he can build on the success he had at the end of last season. Signed for $225,000 as an 18th-rounder in 2012, he saw his stuff tick up last year and allowed just two runs over his last four starts in high Class A.PERSON's fastball has improved from 85-88 mph in high school to 88-94 these days, and he can ride a four-seamer up in the strike zone or sink a two-seamer in the lower half. He also can spin a curveball that creeps into the low 80s, keep hitters off balance with a solid changeup and mix in a cutter.PERSON's arsenal plays up because he throws all his pitches for strikes and generally keeps them down in the strike zone. He has a ceiling of a No. 3 starter but projects more as an efficient No. 4.",0
" It's become somewhat standard of late for the ORGANIZATION not to have a first-round Draft pick, and 2012 was no different, with PERSON being their first selection, in the second round. The GPE high school product is big and strong, with a low-90s fastball that has good movement. He could have a plus heater when all is said and done. His slider could end up being his best pitch, with excellent bite to it. He has a feel for a changeup, though it needs some work, not uncommon for prep pitchers. PERSON's solid pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, albeit brief, should leave ORGANIZATION fans wanting to see more.",1
"  An elite athlete, PERSON is a three-sport star in high school. The same athleticism that allows him to throw down dunks on the basketball court has helped him develop into a coveted right-hander. PERSON' fastball sits in the low 90s and tops out at 95 mph with excellent life. His sharp slider is his best secondary offering and has the potential to be a swing-and-miss offering. His changeup and curveball give him two more pitches that have the chance to be average or better. PERSON, a GPE recruit, has a loose, easy delivery and repeats it well. His long, lean build leads scouts to believe he could add more velocity as he gets stronger and focuses solely on baseball.",0
"PERSON jumped on scouts' radars during 2014 Cape Cod League and then followed it with an even better junior season at ORGANIZATION, leading to his selection in the fourth round of the 2015 Draft by the FACILITY. Despite pitching well in his professional debut -- half of which he spent in the full-season LOCATION League -- the FACILITY traded PERSON and right-hander J.B. Wendelken to GPE in December for PERSON Lawrie.PERSON has the makings of three average-or-better pitches, each of which plays up due to his advanced command. His 6-foot-5 frame and long arms help him create an angle to the plate and also lend to his deception, allowing him to sneak up on opposing hitters with his 88-90 mph fastball. The left-hander's ability to command his heater throughout the zone helps set up his curveball and split-changeup, with both offerings showing above-average potential. While some scouts view PERSON as a future No. 5 starter, others believe he could jump on the fast track to the ORGANIZATION with a move to the bullpen given his command, ground-ball tendencies and solid track record against both right- and left-handed hitters.",0
"GPE is twitchy, has a plus arm and flashes shortstop-worthy actions. He lacks much physical projection but, if he can stay at short he might make enough contact to profile as a utility man.",0
" PERSON continues to be the youngest regular wherever he plays and, as a result, heâs taken some lumps along the way. He struggled for much of the 2012 season in the ORGANIZATION, though he rallied to finish off the year well. He does have the ability to hit for average and power when heâs locked in, but he needs to pick up breaking stuff better for him to find consistency at the plate. He has an outstanding arm and the skills to stay at third long-term. The ORGANIZATION will need to be patient in letting PERSON develop. Theyâve pushed him fairly aggressively so far, but even if things have to slow down for him, he has plenty of time to get the reps he needs in the Minors.",1
"Low-slot, three-pitch righty. Up to 95, slider is out pitch.",0
"The ORGANIZATION were cautious at first with PERSON -- their 2011 first-rounder -- but they let him loose in 2013. He responded by pitching his way from PERSON to Double-A Pensacola by the end of the year, moving him into the upper levels of PERSON's system.PERSON throws his fastball in the mid-to-upper 90s, and he can touch 100 mph. He also throws a big breaking ball and a solid changeup, giving him three pitches with the potential to be above-average offerings. PERSON has smoothed out his delivery as a professional, leading to an improvement in his command. He throws all of his pitches for strikes, and he has an advanced understanding of his craft.PERSON combines the size, stuff and makeup to be a front-line starter in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"If your team of attractive thieves needs a grease man for The Big Heist, then consider PERSON, who is an acrobatic, top-of-the-scale athlete who has on-job robbery experience. A plus runner, PERSON's speed and athleticism help hide some of the circuitous routes he takes to fly balls, and he has the physical talent to be a plus defender in center field as he refines those. He tracks pitches well, walks a lot, and has terrific bat control, which leads to low-lying, all-fields contact. He's a potential leadoff hitter with a plus glove in center, a potential first-division regular. Some clubs think he'll eventually hit for power, but that would require a drastically different approach/style of hitting than PERSON currently employs, and there are a host of other things to refine before the ORGANIZATION tweak a thing PERSON currently does pretty well. He'll be a 19-year-old at Hi-A all season, and could be a top 100 prospect by mid-summer.",0
"PERSON GPE (PERSON, Ga.) is a baseball powerhouse, winning three state titles, sending seven players to the big leagues and getting six players drafted in the top three rounds. PERSON entered 2018 as a good bet to increase that last number to seven, but he hasn't thrown as well as he did on the showcase circuit last summer. While he still offers more upside than the typical prep left-hander, clubs don't think they can take him high enough to sign him away from his PERSON commitment.After sitting at 92-93 mph and touching 95 at times with angle and run on his fastball last summer, PERSON has seen his velocity drop 2-3 mph for much of this spring. His slider has similarly regressed, losing some power and bite and rarely looking like the potential plus pitch he flashed in the past. His changeup wasn't quite as deceptive as it had been previously, though he has the makings of an average third offering.PERSON has a strong frame and the athleticism to throw strikes, though his control also has wavered this year. His delivery is clean but also somewhat slow and gives batters a good look at his pitches. He has a ceiling as a mid-rotation starter but will need plenty of patience and development to get there.",0
"PERSON signed for $500,000 (late third, early fourth round money) as a fifth round high schooler in 2017. He has a four-pitch mix headlined by a slider/cutter and his 88-92mph fastball plays up because it approaches hitters at a tough angle. He'll likely make his full-season debut in 2019 and projects as a No. 5 starter.",0
"For the third year in a row, the ORGANIZATION took a high school position player with their first pick in the ORGANIZATION and this time it was PERSON, whom many thought to be the best pure prep hitter in the 2013 ORGANIZATION class. The ORGANIZATION first baseman has the chance to be an above-average hitter and should add more power as he develops. While he's a quality defender at first, he is limited to that position, so how much pop he does add will determine just how well he profiles at the corner infield spot. Most are confident, however, that his bat should carry him to the big leagues.",1
"One of two lefties the ORGANIZATION received from the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION deal prior to the 2015 season, PERSON certainly made a good first impression on his new organization, pitching across two levels and finishing in the top five in the system in ORGANIZATION, wins, strikeouts, ORGANIZATION and batting average against. He continued to pitch well in Triple-A in 2016 and was called upon to make his big league debut in a spot start in early July.PERSON uses a combination of athleticism, deception and a feel for pitching more than pure stuff to get hitters out. His fastball grades out as average, but plays up because it sinks and he commands it well. He's simplified his breaking ball, going to a slider that is effective. PERSON worked on his changeup a lot in 2015 against right-handed hitters and that's allowed that offspeed pitch to improve. While both secondary pitches are Major League-average offerings, the ORGANIZATION are pleased with how they progressed in 2015. He's all the more effective because he pounds the strike zone.PERSON's ceiling might be somewhat limited, with a No. 4 or 5 starter career ahead of him. But he's also a pretty good bet to reach that ceiling, and in the near future.",1
"PERSON signed for a lot of money ($4.5 million) and amid a lot of controversy in February 2012. He presented a different birthdate than he had previously, a move that some clubs believed was designed to free him from the international bonus restrictions arising from the new Collective Bargaining Agreement. MLB eventually decided that it couldn't determine his birthdate, allowing the ORGANIZATION to keep him but also suspending him until July 2013.PERSON has barely played as a pro, breaking the hamate bone in his left hand 17 games into his debut last summer. He'll need plenty of polish and time to develop, but he also possesses the two tools every team looks for in a right fielder. He has above-average power, thanks to his bat speed and the leverage in his swing, and a cannon for an arm.PERSON will need to make some adjustments at the plate, where his long swing and pull-happy approach hamper his abilty to make consistent contact. He runs well for a big man and should be at least an average defender.",0
"PERSON looked like the prototypical pitchability college lefty after two strong seasons at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, including a starring role in the ORGANIZATION World Series. He backed that up by pitching most of his first full season of pro ball in Double-A after the ORGANIZATION took him in the fifth round of the 2015 Draft. A combination of so-so performance and injuries have caused him to stall a bit.PERSON does have a good feel to pitch and knows how to move the ball around the zone. But he tends to nibble too much and work off the plate, leading to a much higher walk rate than is desirable from a finesse lefty. He has average stuff across the board, with a fastball that sits around 90-91 mph and works best when he keeps it down in the zone to get groundball outs, an average slider and a changeup that usually has good fade to it. The ORGANIZATION have preached to him about being more efficient and force contact earlier in counts because he is not overly physical and long innings will make it harder for him to hold up as a starter. He did have two disabled list stints with a forearm strain in 2017.PERSON made up for some lost innings and pitched largely in relief in the ORGANIZATION, throwing better during that limited stretch. He doesn't really have the stuff to be pitch out of the pen, so he'll have to make strides in attacking hitters to reach his potential as a back-end starter.",0
"Since he was drafted in 2010, people thought PERSON looked like a future reliever. Maybe it was the bloodlines -- he is the son of former closer PERSON, after all -- and maybe it was the stuff.After missing a year following PERSON surgery and another one trying to get innings under his belt as a starter, PERSON moved to the bullpen in 2013, and he took off. After starting a bit slowly, he really progressed in the second half, earning a promotion and then finishing with a strong performance in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's fastball is back up to touching the mid-90s, and he's replaced his curveball with a much better slider.With renewed confidence, PERSON used that ORGANIZATION showing as a springboard. Just 22 for all of the 2014 season, he reached the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION' PERSON season and made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in June.",1
"Though he was a swingman on a loaded GPE pitching staff in 2016, most clubs had no trouble projecting Dunning as a mid-rotation starter. He was in a group of players the FACILITY considered taking with the 26th overall pick in the 2016 Draft before they opted for a different college right-hander in GPE. He went three choices later to the ORGANIZATION, then wound up in GPE anyway as part of a three-prospect package for PERSON Eaton.Dunning's fastball can hit 96 mph in short stints but usually sits in the low 90s when he starts. His heater still plays as a plus pitch because it features heavy sink, as evidenced by his 3.1 groundout-to-flyout ratio in his pro debut. He has a pair of solid secondary offerings in his changeup, which he has full trust in, and his slider, which can lack consistency but has power and depth.Dunning has an athletic, durable build and a fresh arm, so he should be able to handle a starter's workload. He fills the strike zone so easily that he ranked sixth in ORGANIZATION Division I in K/BB ratio (7.3) in his Draft year. His combination of stuff and polish should allow him to move rapidly through the Minors.",0
" After producing a supplemental first-round pick in both 2012 (PERSON, GPE) and 2013 (ORGANIZATION, GPE), ORGANIZATION has a similar talent coming through its pipeline. PERSON helped the ORGANIZATION win the 2012 national title as a sophomore and was part of another championship at the 18-and-under World Cup in GPE in September. He beat GPE in the final game of pool play -- then had his appendix removed the next day.At various times, PERSON will show three pitches that can grade as better than average. His fastball often sits at 90-92 mph and has peaked at 94. He shows aptitude for throwing his changeup, an upper-70s offering with good movement. His curveball is his third-best option at this point yet is a plus offering when he throws it with more power in the high 70s.Though PERSON lacks size, he uses a high three-quarters delivery to drive is pitches down in the strike zone. He's athletic and repeats his delivery well. He originally committed to GPE before changing his mind and opting for PERSON.",0
" While any discussion of GPE is mostly about projection, the GPE thought enough of him after his 2011 GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION that they sent him to the full-season ORGANIZATION in 2012 at age 19. He may not have taken the league by storm, but the switch-hitting infielder-turned-outfielder did have double-digits home runs and more than 20 stolen bases. Heâs still learning how to hit, but has the chance to be a pretty good all-around hitter. If he can add some strength, there might be a little power down the road. If he refines his approach a bit, his plus speed could work at the top of the lineup and as a future above-average defender in center field.",0
"Relatively projectable, ORGANIZATION sits in the 89-92 range with curveball feel and could develop enough of a changeup and control to pitch at the back of a rotation.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have a reputation of late for producing professional-level pitching talent, and for good reason given the five arms that were taken in the top four rounds a year ago as well as PERSON, who could be a top pick this coming June. But a player like PERSON, with a track record of success in the ORGANIZATION and ORGANIZATION bloodlines, should not be overlooked.The son of long-time big league hurler PERSON, PERSON brings considerable knowledge of the game to the field daily. He has more value if you believe he can be an everyday shortstop and he is a solid defender there, one who knows how to position himself and whose instincts should let him stay there. The biggest question might be about his arm, which was solid-average before he needed a procedure to move a nerve in his elbow, keeping him out of fall activities. An above-average runner, PERSON does have some gap power and an advanced approach at the plate.Teams will undoubtedly be concerned about his size and whether his 5-foot-11 frame will hinder him at the next level. With a dearth of college position players, a team that believes he can indeed stick at short will consider him early.",0
" Joining the A's organization by way of ORGANIZATION III Birmingham-Southern, ORGANIZATION is now the de facto top catching prospect in the system since PERSON was shipped off to GPE. Left-handed hitting catchers are always a premium, and ORGANIZATION has the chance to hit for average and power as he progresses, thanks to a solid approach at the plate. He has the arm for the position, throwing out 33 percent of would-be base stealers during his debut, almost entirely in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League, but that number dropped to 16 percent in 2013, between the ORGANIZATION and ORGANIZATION. He's not the most athletic receiver you'll see, and there are some who aren't sure if he'll be able to stay behind the plate. He started out there, though, with the A's hoping he can develop into an offensive-minded regular backstop at the big league level.",0
"The best junior college prospect in the 2016 Draft, PERSON likely will fall just short of becoming the highest selection in GPE A. Logan (Ill.) CC history, a distinction that belongs to FACILITY Sox 1994 second-rounder PERSON. After the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the 29th round last year, he spent the summer adding strength, which has led to more dominant stuff this year. He went 12-1, 1.22 in 13 starts with 117 strikeouts in 103 innings, ranking third in wins, fifth in ORGANIZATION and seventh in whiffs among national junior college pitchers entering the ORGANIZATION World Series.After topping out at 93-94 mph in 2015, PERSON now consistently works at 91-94 mph with his fastball and has hit 98 in short stints. His slider has gotten harder and sharper as well, showing flashes of becoming a solid pitch. He also has made strides with his changeup, enhancing his chances of remaining a starter.With his 6-foot-6 frame and three-quarters delivery, PERSON creates good angle with his pitches. The ORGANIZATION recruit has no problem filling the strike zone, though he'll need to improve the command of his fastball and the consistency of his secondary pitches to make it as a big league starter. If he can't, he has promise as a late-inning reliever.",0
"Finding college bats with power seems tough to do these days, so when a hitter at a good college program not only has it, but shows he can use it in games, teams will take notice. PERSON was among the nation's leaders in home runs in 2015, a breakout season at just the right time.PERSON's power from the right side of the plate is not in question, with home run pop to all fields, and not just in batting practice displays. He has a solid approach at the plate, though some evaluators have concern about his ability to hit better pitching. The biggest worry, though, is about PERSON's throwing arm, which is well below-average. He's played third and the outfield in the past, but it seems like first base, where he's played this spring, is his only future position.Regardless of defensive inadequacies, PERSON has hit in the ORGANIZATION and then carried it over to his junior season. Someone is bound to buy the bat in the top four rounds.",0
"PERSON had one of the strongest arms among catchers in the 2016 Draft, but worries about his bat and signability pushed him to the Reds in the 28th round and eventually to GPE. He hit just .222/.313/.290 in his first two seasons in GPE, and his lack of offensive production relegated him to backup duty between 2018 Marlins fourth-rounder PERSON. He has shown significant improvement as a hitter and receiver this spring, putting him in position to get selected in the same range as Fortes.Any discussion of PERSON still starts with his arm, a well above-average cannon that regularly registers sub-1.9-second pop times and helped him erase 45 percent of basestealers during the 2019 regular season. He has worked hard to improve his receiving and blocking, which had been subpar in the past but now elicit average to solid grades. His overall defensive game is good enough to project him as at least a big league backup.While scouts still aren't sold that PERSON will hit enough to be a regular in the Majors, he has gotten better. He has a more selective approach, is putting together more competitive at-bats and is making better contact. He's stronger and his right-handed swing looks quicker, giving him a chance to produce close to average power.",0
"A toolsy outfielder as well as an outstanding closer at ORGANIZATION State PERSON, PERSON might be one of the more intriguing prospects from the 2013 Draft class because the Reds are going to continue, in some capacity, to allow him to be a two-way player. He began his pro career solely as a pitcher and could make a beeline to the big leagues as a short reliever thanks to his plus fastball and a hard breaking ball that could be above-average in the future. Both that curve and his command should improve if he were to focus solely on pitching. PERSON has been inconsistent at times with the bat, though he does have some raw tools to hit and run well.",1
"PERSON has arguably the best hitter's traits in the entire draft. His bat is quick, he can move the barrel around and square pitches in various parts of the strike zone, he generates good extension through contact and has already started to grow into the power necessary to profile at firts base. PERSON also has mature ball/strike recognition and often displays visible contempt for umpires who lack it. He's a good athlete and potential defensive asset at first with good hands, footwork and an above average infield arm.",0
" PERSON is a perfect example of a high risk/high reward type prospect. The raw tools are undeniable; whether he can put them to consistent use remains to be seen. He has a lot of work to do at the plate -- he didn't exactly light the world on fire in his performance in the ORGANIZATION in 2013 -- but there are the skills to perhaps be an average hitter with average power. He has a strong arm that works fine at shortstop, but it's unclear what his long-term defensive home is. The future fielding grade is based on him at third base, though the Twins have PERSON at the same level and PERSON above, and many feel PERSON will end up in the outfield. If his bat can develop as hoped, the organization will find a spot for him when the time comes.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 21, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON landed two All-Tournament team awards in 2014 and '15, and he earned the GPE 24-5A Newcomer of the Year award in '15. PERSON parlayed a stellar junior season into an offer and a commitment to the ORGANIZATION of GPE at FACILITY. The PERSON outfielder was a unanimous choice to win GPE 24-5A Offensive MVP last season and also recorded an All-Tournament team honor at the 17U ORGANIZATION Championship.",0
"PERSON hit everywhere he'd ever played before a surprising summer slump with the GPE collegiate national team. It carried over to a slow start during his junior year at ORGANIZATION, though he turned it up a notch and went back to showing an ability to swing the bat well. There are those who believe PERSON has one of the best bats in the 2015 college class. He was named the 2014 ORGANIZATION of the Year as a sophomore, after leading the league in all three slash stats at .351/.472/.557. PERSON has a quick left-handed stroke, strength and patience. He has plus raw power but he doesn't fully tap into it because he bats from an extreme crouch and has a flat swing. He might hit 20 homers per season if he stands more upright and adds some loft. Though he's listed at 6 feet and 230 pounds, he's a better athlete than his build might indicate. An all-state running back at FACILITY (PERSON, Fla.), an athletic powerhouse that produced PERSON and several other pro and Olympic athletes, PERSON has close to average speed. He has good instincts as a runner and defender, though a below-average arm limits him to left field.",0
"Since moving to the bullpen in July of 2018, PERSON has struck out more than a batter per inning in what are almost always multi-inning appearances. After a dominant month at Hi-A to start 2019, the ORGANIZATION moved PERSON to Double-A and atrted to vary his workload, and first asked hiim to throw on back-to-back nights at the end of July. He's being groomed for a relief role, one that will likely be fastball-heavy. His fastball has life at the top of the zone and PERSON really hides the ball well, so he's able to slip it past hitters at the letters. His secondary stuff is average on pure stuff but plays well off his heater. He profiles as a middle reliever.",0
"The ORGANIZATION made PERSON a sixth-rounder in 2012, one year after his brother, GPE, went in the seventh round to the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION quickly made the younger PERSON a second baseman, where his range and arm will likely make him a solid defender. At the plate, PERSON has an advanced approach and consistently barrels up balls. He doesn't have much power and he gets the most out of his average speed. Some scouts believe PERSON has a higher ceiling than his older brother. He began his first full-professional season in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"The first position player selected by the ORGANIZATION in the 2015 Draft, PERSON gave up a Stanford commitment to sign for $1 million as a second-rounder. His debut didn't go well, as he hit just .201/.281/.282 in the Rookie-level PERSON and left several scouts wondering whether his left-handed swing would play in pro ball. He made quality adjustments before his second season, however, and is looking more like the player the ORGANIZATION hoped they were getting.After producing a lot of weak contact last summer, PERSON now has a more consistent approach, is getting in better position to hit and has more leverage in his stroke. He's exuding much more confidence at the plate, tinkering a lot less and not rolling over on weak grounders as much as he did a year ago. He still needs to tighten up his plate discipline, but he could hit for a decent average with 15-20 homers per season.Though PERSON isn't especially quick out of the batter's box, he has close to plus speed once he gets going. He has played all three outfield positions in pro ball and has seen most of his time in left field, where his fringy arm fits best. His overall game has drawn him comparisons to PERSON and PERSON.",0
" Depending on when you saw PERSON, GPE's left-handed closer, you saw a potential late-inning reliever with a power arm or a southpaw with poor command and less than explosive stuff who looked more like a specialist. The ORGANIZATION clearly saw enough of the former to make him their third-round selection in the 2015 Draft.At his best, PERSON has a plus fastball from the left side, one that will touch 96 mph on occasion. He'll more typically sit in the 89-92 mph range, leaving some wondering if he has the capacity to hit the mid-90s with more consistency in the pro game. His curve is fringy at times, better when he stays on top of it. He has a quick arm and his delivery does add some deception. The effort in that delivery does make it a bit more difficult for him to find the strike zone more consistently. If PERSON can unlock that plus velocity more consistently, he could evolve into lefty setup man. At worst, PERSON does have the deception to be a specialist down the line.",0
"After spending his first two college seasons at first base, PERSON made the move behind the plate during the summer in the ORGANIZATION and was named an All-Star in the elite summer college circuit.During his junior year, PERSON saw some time behind the plate for the GPE, while also playing first base and right field. He has the skills to stick as a backstop, with a solid average arm and quick release. He's very athletic and runs well for a catcher or first baseman. He doesn't get cheated at the plate, and his combination of bat speed and strength should mean he hits for average and some power at the next level.PERSON's value obviously is higher if he's behind the plate, and the team that believes he can develop there will take him in the first few rounds.",0
"PERSON's ORGANIZATION stock steadily improved during his senior year at ORGANIZATION, where he posted a 1.07 ERA with a 0.85 ORGANIZATION and 11.8 strikeouts per nine while leading the program to a third-place finish in the 2014 ORGANIZATION World Series. The ORGANIZATION made him their fifth-round pick that June. After two pedestrian seasons to begin his career, the right-hander broke out in 2016, earning All-Star honors in the ORGANIZATION before a second-half promotion to Double-A. He's continued his ascent towards the Majors in 2017, posting strong numbers back in the LOCATION en route to a Triple-A promotion late in May.Big and physical, PERSON generates a plus fastball that sits at 93-96 mph and at times touches higher, all the while working on a downhill plane that fuels his impressive ground-ball rate. He has a pair of promising secondary pitches in a curveball and a changeup, with the latter currently grading as the better offering. Meanwhile, PERSON showed improved strike-throwing ability last season after working with the ORGANIZATION to simplify his delivery.PERSON was one the more improved players in the ORGANIZATION' system since the start of 2016, and they believe he has the ingredients to start at the highest level. If not, the right-hander's power arm could make him an effective late-inning reliever.",0
"Acquired from GPE as part of the ORGANIZATION Pressly trade, PERSON has reached Double-A as a starter despite having been projected as a reliever for almost his entire pro career. Fastball control and a viable changeup have both been elusive, and you could argue PERSON's issues repeating/locating also impact the way his slider plays, though it does have nasty late bite. He throws really hard -- typically in the mid-90s, peaking above that -- and has a great build. It makes sense to give him starter reps until he's needed in the majors, since it means more chances for him to refine his secondary stuff and control. He's a high-probability middle reliever, but he has a set-up man's arm strength.",0
"PERSON joined the D-backs along with PERSON last Trading Deadline, the return for PERSON. The D-backs had drafted the lefty out of high school in 2011, but didn't sign him, so they were happy to land him three years later and watch him pitch very well in six post-deadline starts in his new organization.PERSON worked in a piggyback system with the Brewers during his first taste of full-season ball, with mixed results. But he really took off after the trade, showing much better command and a better understanding of how to use his three-pitch mix. His fastball is a tick above average now, touching 93 mph with good life, and there might some more in the tank. His curveball is an average breaking ball and his changeup shows glimpses of being an above-average secondary pitch. The left-hander misses bats, but before his six-start revelation with the D-backs, throwing strikes consistently had been elusive.PERSON's success in those areas carried over to his first full season with the D-backs and it's looking like he might have the ceiling of a No. 3 or 4 starter.",1
"On a ORGANIZATION staff loaded with hard-throwing right-handers, no one throws harder than PERSON. He usually deals at 92-95 mph, tickles the upper 90s and has peaked at 99.PERSON's fastball lacks life and command, however, so it gets hit more than its velocity suggests it should. As a result, the ORGANIZATION have used him mostly as a set-up man, which is also his likely ceiling as a pro.PERSON's second pitch is a hard curveball with 11-to-5 break. He's not especially tall, so he needs to stay on top of his pitches with his overhand delivery to achieve some downhill plane. Otherwise, his stuff becomes vulnerable when he leaves it up in the strike zone.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the seventh round of the 2012 Draft and went over pick value to sign him away from attending PERSON, they knew the right-hander was a bit of a long-term project as a position player who emerged as a pitching prospect during his senior year of high school. It took until his fourth summer to reach full-season ball, but he's been moving at a steady clip since, heading to Double-A for the 2017 season.PERSON always had a tall and projectable frame and he's grown into it. He throws his fastball in the 90-95 mph range and he's shown an ability to use his 6-foot-5 frame to throw it downhill and get groundball outs. He throws both a curve and a slider, with the former a bit ahead of the latter. His changeup continues to improve the more he throws it. He's generally around the strike zone with all of his pitches.While PERSON has been in pro ball for six years, he might still have some upside while getting close to being ready to knock on the door as a back-half of a rotation type starter.",0
"PERSON began to ascend the fall after his freshman year, when he looked like one of the two most talented PERSON players during fall practices in GSP. He then broke out as a sophomore, and further separated himself from the rest of the top talents with an electrifying 2018 postseason. He held the top spot, wire-to-wire, during the subsequent 12 months, which included him hitting .427/.584/.772 as a junior. It's because GSP is good at everything. Remarkably mobile for someone his size, he comfortably has the skills to not only stay at catcher, but excel there. He's an agile ball-blocker, he can throw, and he's a con artist pitch-framer who gets umpires booed because fans are convinced they're all strikes. On top of that, this is a switch-hitter with both power and feel for contact from both sides of the plate and an intense, earnest, vocal leader. He is arguably the best draft prospect of the last half decade, a polished, complete player with star-level physical tools.",0
"PERSON was a projection prep arm from GPE whose price was just high enough to get him to GPE. He had a big freshman year there and then had a national coming-out party as the ace of ORGANIZATION USA that summer. PERSON continued at about that level for the next two seasons, slinging in a heavy, 91-96 mph sinker from a low slot with a deceptive, crossfire delivery. He threw strikes and had a plus slider. Scouts who weren't as enthusiastic about PERSON's changeup, or arm slot, or the length of his arm action saw a reliever. His stuff would flatten out and his command would back up as he fatigued into the late stages of some starts. The ORGANIZATION had PERSON change his delivery and arm action for the first half-dozen or so starts in 2018, focusing on a more traditional four-seam fastball approach. It didn't work, and GPE let PERSON go back to what he had been doing later in the year, and his dominant final two months of 2018 reflect his comfort with this approach. We think the likely outcome here is a multi-inning power reliever who dominates righties with strikeouts and groundballs, though some see a starter in the mold of PERSON. Either way, PERSON should move quickly, especially if he's only asked to face a lineup once or twice per outing.",0
"PERSON is PERSON's all-time saves leader. He was 93-96 with an above-average slider almost every time out as a ORGANIZATION, but began experiencing wild fluctuations in velocity during his early time in pro ball. But in 2017, his stuff returned to its collegiate form; the ORGANIZATION traded him for ORGANIZATION bonus space, and PERSON sped to the majors. He profiles as a standard, two-pitch reliever, but the velo fluctuation and 2016 injury dilute his FV a tad.",1
"PERSON was raw and lanky when PERSON signed him as an 18-year-old out of GPE in 2009. It took him some time to figure things out on the mound, and the ORGANIZATION were rewarded for their patience, as he took a big step forward in 2014, earning a spot on the World team at the ORGANIZATION XM All-Star PERSON Game.PERSON stands out the most for his powerful fastball, which has been clocked up to 100 mph and typically sits in the mid-90s. He combines it with a sharp hard slider that is an above-average offering at its best.Like many tall pitchers, it has taken PERSON some time to smooth out his delivery. He still likely will never pitch with great control, but his stuff is good enough to make him effective at the back of a bullpen.",0
"PERSON doesn't have prototypical size for a starting pitcher, but he makes up for it with arm strength. He was PERSON' ace as a junior and excelled in the role. PERSON's fastball typically sits in the low-90s and routinely reaches the mid-90s. His curve is a potential out pitch, with a hard, sharp break to it, and his changeup has the chance to be an average offering as well, though he has to become more consistent with his arm speed. PERSON goes right after hitters, and his bulldog mentality would serve him well if he ever moves to the bullpen. The ORGANIZATION will develop him as a starter for now, and he has the tools to give him a chance to stay in the rotation.",0
"PERSON declined to sign with the ORGANIZATION as the 21st overall pick in the 2011 Draft, then became the 18th player ever taken in the first round twice when the ORGANIZATION popped him at ORGANIZATION. 14 last June. After helping ORGANIZATION win the ORGANIZATION World Series, he signed for $2,613,200. When he's on, PERSON has three plus pitches and the look of a frontline starter. He can throw his 92-97 mph fastball past hitters or throw them off balance with his lively changeup. He also has a power curveball, though he lost his feel for it at the end of the college season.With his strong, athletic build, PERSON maintains his stuff into the late innings. He had a history of struggling to repeat his delivery and losing his control and command at times, but he has been much more consistent in his first full pro season.",0
"LOCATION has never had a pitcher taken in the top five rounds of the GPE, with only outfielders PERSON and PERSON going that early. PERSON, who began the year as the ORGANIZATION' Tuesday starter but worked his way to being their Friday night ace en route to being a ORGANIZATION semifinalist, has the chance to become the first.PERSON has a solid three-pitch mix that points to a future as a starting pitcher at the next level. He'll throw his fastball in the 90-94 mph range and maintains his velocity, able to reach back for that 94 late in starts when he needs it. His breaking ball is close to a 12-to-6 curve with late and sharp break to it and he throws an effective mid-80s circle change that has the bottom fall out of it. He commands all three pitches well and has thrown a lot more strikes, while missing more bats, this year compared to his sophomore season.PERSON has a limited ceiling, that of a No. 4 or 5 starter. But his performance in his GPE season has had more than ORGANIZATION voters take notice, giving him a good chance to become the first LOCATION pitcher to go in the top six rounds since the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in 2008.",0
"GPE parlayed his impressive turn in the 2014 Cape Cod League with a strong junior year at ORGANIZATION into a second-round selection in the '15 PERSON. The ORGANIZATION gave the right-hander a $1,108,000 bonus as the ORGANIZATION. 55 overall pick, and GPE quickly rewarded the organization by pitching well at ORGANIZATION A Wisconsin in his pro debut. A right forearm strain suffered early in 2016 led to a two-month disabled-list stint, and GPE was ineffective when he finally took the mound. PERSON healthy in 2017, GPE finally furthered his development, pitching well over 22 starts (3.38 ERA) with PERSON and then finishing his season on a high note in Double-A.Listed at 6-foot-6, 265 pounds, GPE has an imposing presence on the mound. He's sacrificed some of his velocity for better command, though he still sits comfortably in the low 90s and at times higher, with an upper-80s cutter enables him to effectively attack left-handed hitters under the hands. His changeup is below average because he throws it too firmly, albeit it with fastball-like arm speed. His curveball, though still slurvy at times, has improved as a professional and receives average grades from evaluators. He throws all four pitches for strikes, and knows how to utilize his height to drive the ball down in the zone.GPE's strikeout rate backed up in 2017 as he focused on throwing more quality strikes and working deeper into games. While he still needs to refine his secondaries and fastball command, as well as answer some lingering questions about his durability, GPE has all the ingredients needed to become a big league starter.",0
"PERSON projected to go in the middle of the first round of the 2014 Draft, yet the FACILITY Sox were able to get him with the 44th overall choice in the second round. If his pro debut (which included a 59/4 K/BB ratio) is any indication, he could be a bigger steal than PERSON was with the ORGANIZATION. 3 overall pick.PERSON has a promising four-pitch repertoire that starts with a low-90s fastball that tops out at 96 mph with good sink. His hard slider gives him a potential second plus pitch, while his curveball and changeup show the makings of becoming solid offerings. Add in his control and makeup, and PERSON has a high floor to go with his lofty ceiling. One of the most athletic and projectable pitchers available in the 2014 Draft, he's a former three-sport star who easily repeats a loose, effortless delivery.",0
" Ever since the ORGANIZATION took him and gave him a way above-slot bonus in 2010, PERSON has hit his way quickly up the organizational ladder, reaching Double-A in 2012 and winning PERSON MVP honors along the way. He can flat-out hit, adjusting extremely well to any and all pitching. He drives the ball to all fields and while he hasn't shown too much in the way of home run power to date, there is definitely pop in his bat that will come. PERSON started his pro career as a third baseman and could have been an average defender there, but he moved to the outfield in 2012, largely to find the quickest path to the big leagues for his bat. There isn't a spot waiting for him just yet, but don't be surprised if he hits his way into PERSON's plans in the near future.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"A good get for $150,000 in the ninth round of his draft, PERSON is a slightly atypical teenage projection arm with feel for spin. PERSON to the way PERSON was viewed by a minority of teams, some clubs thought PERSON's measurables were misleading as to his projectability and that his frame was so slight that there was nowhere to put extra mass. So far PERSON's fastball is up a little bit from high school but still south of the average big league heater, and we now have quantifiable verification that he can spin his breaking ball well (about 2500 rpm on average). If the velocity suddenly pops, he'll shoot up past the relief-only types on this list as PERSON will have a better chance of starting.",0
"There are gothic cathedrals in GPE that have smaller gaps between their ceilings and floors than PERSON, who had some of the most explosive but unkempt talent in the 2018 draft class. PERSON's special bat speed and ability to rotate are both evident to the naked eye, and he also has remarkable bat control for a player who takes such high-effort swings. But everything about his game is very raw and he'll likely require years of polish before he's ready for the majors. This is especially evident in his footwork in the box, where PERSON's stride length and direction are both highly variable. At times, this enables PERSON to turn on pitches on the inner half; at others it wrecks his swing's balance and composition entirely. There's also a wide range of potential defensive outcomes for PERSON. He may end up on the middle infield or in center, depending on how his body and infield actions develop, or possibly in an outfield corner. The good news is that PERSON was one of the youngest players available in the 2018 draft and he didn't turn 18 the middle of October. There's a lot of time for both him and the ORGANIZATION to figure this stuff out, and he has some unteachable talents (the bat speed and bat control) that could drive an offensive profile befitting any position if he transforms into a hitter instead of a swinger.",0
"The best teenaged prospect to come out of GPE since PERSON in 2011, PERSON sparked a bidding war among teams that landed him a $31.5 million bonus from the ORGANIZATION. That's the largest bonus ever given to an amateur player, eclipsing the $16.25 million (deferred over 11 years) Aroldis PERSON got from the Reds in 2010. Factor in the matching $31.5 million penalty that PERSON had to pay for exceeding its international bonus pool, and the total outlay for his services was $63 million.PERSON offers more offensive potential than most middle infielders. He's a switch-hitter with electric bat speed who makes consistent hard contact from both sides of the plate. He could deliver a .280 average and 20-25 homers on an annual basis, and he also has the well above-average speed to be a significant basestealing threat.PERSON primarily played second and third base in GPE while also seeing time at shortstop and in center field. His strong arm can play anywhere on the diamond, and the consensus among scouts is that he fits best at second base. He's young and may need a couple of years in the Minors, but he looks like a star who will be worth the wait.",1
"Undrafted out of ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, GPE), PERSON spent two years pitching for the ORGANIZATION in the independent Frontier League before inking a deal with the Marlins in July 2016. He's since climbed quickly through the Minors, opening his first full professional campaign with PERSON, where he was a ORGANIZATION State PERSON, and reaching Double-A roughly a year after signing.PERSON may pitch with a tick below average velocity, but his fastball plays up because he creates a good downhill angle to the plate with a deceptive delivery. His changeup is above average, features good velocity separation and is effective against hitters on both sides of the plate. A fringy curveball gives PERSON a third pitch that club officials say has improved in his first full season.PERSON gets the most out of his three-pitch mix because he's a consistent strike-thrower who has feel for changing speeds and keeping hitters off balance. And while his stuff may not be overpowering, it hasn't stopped the right-hander from piling up his share of whiffs early in his pro career. He profiles as a back-of-the-rotation starter or a long reliever.",0
"GPE school players from western PERSON often need some time to adjust to the pro game, with the level of competition at the amateur level there not particularly high. The ORGANIZATION are willing to be patient with PERSON because they see a toolbox just waiting to be opened.PERSON certainly looks the part, a big, strong physical outfielder with power and speed. The power was on display in his second summer of pro ball when he led the LOCATION in home runs with 11. He also struck out nearly 47 percent of the time and, simply put, he'll need to put balls in play more to tap into that power. PERSON runs well and plays a better center field than anticipated, with good jumps and routes to go along with a solid arm, giving him a chance to stay up the middle long-term.PERSON is still a project, one far away from the big leagues. If he can learn to control the strize zone more, he could unleash a lot more power and run production in the future.",0
"  An athletic, toolsy outfielder when the ORGANIZATION drafted him in 2012, PERSON turned that promise into production in a breakout 2014 season. He was named the ORGANIZATION of the Year after posting a .905 ORGANIZATION, collecting 153 hits and scoring 87 runs in 130 games between Class A Quad Cities and Class A Advanced Lancaster. In his first two years in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON looked more like a top-of-the-order hitter thanks to his patience, contact-oriented approach and speed. A tweak to his swing allowed him to tap into newfound power this season. After not homering in his first two years as a professional, he hit 17 in 2014, including a stretch where he homered in five straight games. He's an above-average runner, giving him an intriguing power-speed combination. PERSON' speed gives him a chance to stick in center field, though some scouts think he's better suited defensively for right field. His strong arm will play well at either position.",1
"PERSON became a full-time catcher in the summer before his senior season at GPE (GPE) High and showed enough promise to earn top-five-rounds consideration in the 2013 Draft, though he went unpicked because he was strongly committed to GPE. He was the regular catcher on the ORGANIZATION' 2014 College World Series team as a freshman and has split time behind the plate the past two years while also seeing action at first and third base.PERSON's most impressive tool is his plus raw right-handed power, which he generates with a combination of bat speed and strength. The question is how much he'll be able to tap into that pop in pro ball because he often tries to do too much at the plate and pull every pitch out of the park. He has hit .169 with wood bats in two summers in the ORGANIZATION and will have to tone down his approach to handle pro pitching.GPE has played PERSON on the infield corners more because of team need than any lack of ability at catcher. His receiving and blocking skills are fine, and he has a solid, accurate arm. Though he's a bottom-of-the-scale runner, he moves well enough behind the plate.",0
"Players taken in the 28th round of the GPE, even athletic two-sport standouts like ORGANIZATION, don't enter pro ball with a ton of expectations. ORGANIZATION signed for $100,000 back in 2013 and has consistently outperformed his GPE status, including hitting his way across three levels up to Triple-A in 2017 and earning a spot on the 40-man roster. That led to his first big league callup in 2018.After a slow start to his pro career, things really started to click for ORGANIZATION in 2016 when he hit over .300 and got on base more than 40 percent of the time. He kept hitting and showing an advanced approach at the plate in 2017, earning two promotions in the process. He continued to draw walks, and while his strikeout rate went up, he doesn't chase very often and showed some more extra-base pop, especially late in the season. He's always had good speed and used it with much greater success a year ago, leading the organization in stolen bases.ORGANIZATION continues to see time in all three outfield spots, though he's played more center field than anywhere else. His future is likely to be that of a very valuable fourth outfielder, but if his defense and baserunning continue to improve, the ORGANIZATION are not ruling out the 23-year-old developing into more of an impact type of big leaguer.",1
"PERSON had a huge sophomore year at ORGANIZATION's, then followed up with a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION, making him one of the better college catching options heading into his Draft year in 2017. But a rough junior year hurt his stock, making him available in the fifth round for the ORGANIZATION, who signed him for just below pick value. Whatever problems PERSON had at ORGANIZATION's weren't apparent during his pro debut as he made the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League All-Star team.Since beginning his ORGANIZATION career, PERSON has gotten back to what worked for him before his rough junior campaign. He has shown the ability to make hard contact and the power that was on display as a sophomore and on the ORGANIZATION has come back, especially to the pull side, though there is some swing and miss to his offensive game. He's a decent receiver, with decent hands and blocking ability, though his arm is below-average at this point. The ORGANIZATION like his leadership behind the plate.There's work to be done on PERSON's defensive game, but the ORGANIZATION are committed to allowing him to develop behind the plate. If he can progress there, he has the makings of an offensive-minded backstop who can at least be a serviceable backup at the highest level.",0
"Once a walk-on at ORGANIZATION, PERSON has become one of the more well-rounded catching prospects in the minors. He has always had near elite arm strength but because he didn't catch much pro-quality stuff in college, his receiving and ball-blocking were undercooked for a college prospect when he first entered pro ball. Those aspects of his defense have vastly improved, and he's now an average defender with a chance to be above, and his arm douses opposing baserunners. 
PERSON also has plus raw power, though he hasn't typically hit for it in games for various reasons. In college, a broken hamate likely masked his power and was part of the reason he fell to the 2016 draft's third round. In pro ball, his swing has been very compact, relying on PERSON's raw strength rather than efficient biomechanical movement to deliver extra-bases. He broke his other hamate last year. PERSON's nearly .500 SLG at ORGANIZATION is above what we expect moving forward, and instead think PERSON will be a high-contact bat with doubles power, which would be an above-average regular behind the plate.",0
"PERSON didn't make an immediate impression after signing for $75,000 out of the ORGANIZATION (P.R.) JC in 2015, batting a combined .223/.317/.319 in his first two pro seasons. Then he opened eyes in the GPE PERSON in 2016-17, leading the circuit in on-base percentage (.393) while ranking second in hitting (.330) and ORGANIZATION (.806). That proved to be a prelude to a breakout last season, when he topped the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION in batting (.310) and hits (144). PERSON's hand-eye coordination and penchant for making hard contact suggest that his hitting ability is very real, even if a right thumb injury has affected his numbers this year. He began to tap into his solid raw power more often in 2017, and he could do so even more if he adds some loft to his right-handed stroke because he hits a lot of ground balls. He also walks infrequently because he puts the ball in play so easily.One of the best all-around players in the ORGANIZATION system, PERSON also offers quality defense at third base. He's agile, has sure hands and a strong arm, though he needs to cut down on his errors after leading ORGANIZATION third basemen with 21. He has fringy speed but runs the bases aggressively.",0
"GPE hit for average but not much power in his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION and in the ORGANIZATION, and his prospect stock didn't take off until he hit 13 homers last spring. He earned Mid-American player of the year honors and went in the third round to the FACILITY, signing for $719,100. He continued to produce after turning pro, earning a promotion to low Class A after a month.One of the better college athletes available in the 2016 Draft, GPE has a chance to develop average or better tools across the board. He doesn't have the smoothest right-handed swing, but he manages the strike zone extremely well and makes consistent hard contact. He might top out around 15 homers per season, though that might be enough to make him a regular considering his hitting and on-base ability.GPE has solid speed out of the batter's box and is a plus runner once he gets going. He's quick enough to steal a few bases and GPE has made him a full-time center fielder after he manned right field for ORGANIZATION. He has the plus arm to play there in pro ball and his ability to handle all three outfield spots will help him if he winds up as a reserve.",0
"The ORGANIZATION took PERSON with the ORGANIZATION. 35 overall pick after his junior year at ORGANIZATION. Rather than sign, the right-hander bet on himself and headed back to school for his senior season. That decision didn't go as well as planned and after an uneven season, he ended up landing in the fourth round of the 2016 Draft. While injuries have slowed PERSON's progress, it still looks like the ORGANIZATION got a serious bargain. He pitched his was up to the ORGANIZATION State League in his first full season and would have reached Double-A if not for a bout of elbow inflammation. The elbow wasn't a problem for PERSON in 2018, but he did suffer a broken foot (while walking on an uneven sidewalk) that ended his season in late July after he had made two starts in Triple-A. When he's healthy, PERSON will sit in the low 90s and can reach back for 95 mph. He has a trio of secondary pitches that receive average grades from evaluators. PERSON's slider continues to be ahead of his fringy curveball, though he does land the latter for strikes and uses it in any count. He's made progress developing a changeup to the point where it's regarded as an average big league offering, with room to improve. Facing Double- and Triple-A hitters for the first time last year led to a regression in PERSON's control, but he's generally around the zone with all four pitches, with feel for sequencing that leads to weak contact and a solid number of whiffs. Despite his season-ending injuries in back-to-back years, PERSON still has been able to move through the ORGANIZATION relatively fast and will open 2019 on the cusp of the Majors. A strong performance back in Triple-A should help him get there, while further improvements to his secondary arsenal and command could help him reach his potential as a mid-rotation starter.",0
"A 33rd-round pick out of a GPE high school by the ORGANIZATION in 2016, PERSON made an instant impact at ORGANIZATION. He led the LOCATION and all ORGANIZATION Division I freshmen with 10 wins and helped the ORGANIZATION advance to the first super regional in program history in 2017. He has improved throughout his college career and could factor in the first five rounds of the Draft.PERSON employs a low arm slot and opens early in his delivery, which doesn't thrill scouts but creates tremendous sink. He has averageish velocity on his fastball, ranging from 88-95 mph, but well above-average life that generates a lot of swings and misses as well as groundballs. He also commands his heater well, and the net result is that it plays as a plus pitch.PERSON has a sweepy slider that's effective because it moves in the opposite direction from his sinker. His fading changeup is a reliable third option and can be a solid pitch at its best. A dogged competitor, he has a ceiling of a No. 4 or 5 starter and could have value as a multi-inning reliever.",0
" PERSON has two legitimate pitches and a history of success against top competition, so the PERSON felt comfortable drafting him in the seventh round, then giving him second-round money to sign him away from ORGANIZATION State.The Arkansas high school right-hander doesn't have much projection remaining in his 6-foot-1 frame, but he can hit 96 mph with his fastball and he generates a lot of sink and groundouts when he works at 88-93. He also has good feel for spinning a curveball, giving him a second solid pitch. His fading changeup should continue to get better as he uses it more often at the next level.Though he's not projectable, PERSON has a strong frame and repeats his sound delivery well, which bodes well for throwing strikes and staying healthy.",0
"  GPE to a strong showing with PERSON in 2013 and the following spring at ORGANIZATION, PERSON appeared to be on his way to becoming a top 10 pick in the 2014 GPE until he underwent PERSON surgery that May. Despite the injury, he didn't fall far on GPE day, as the ORGANIZATION grabbed him 18th overall.When healthy, PERSON usually deals fastballs at 91-93 mph, topping out at 97, and the pitch plays up because it has nice life, and he can locate it where he wants. His low-80s slider can be inconsistent but should give him a second plus pitch down the road. He also shows flashes of having a useful changeup.The ORGANIZATION have had success helping young pitchers through PERSON rehab, including PERSON, their top prospect and 2012 first-rounder. Once PERSON returns to full health, he has the potential to give the ORGANIZATION system another premium arm.",1
" After two years as a little-used two-way player at FACILITY, PERSON transferred to LOCATION. He went undrafted as a junior first baseman/closer, and was one of the first seniors taken in 2015 when the ORGANIZATION signed him for more than $400,000 below pick value at the start of ORGANIZATION B.PERSON ranked among the ORGANIZATION II leaders in home runs and slugging percentage, but his future is on the mound. He was working at 93-95 mph and reaching 97 with his fastball. His 82-86 slider gives him a second plus pitch at times, though it can get slurvy. PERSON has a physical, durable frame that allows him to maintain his velocity even when he pitches on consecutive days. He has a decent delivery that he repeats well, allowing him to throw strikes. He'll probably be a late-inning reliever in pro ball, though he flashes an average changeup in bullpen sessions and could get a look as a starter, especially given the ORGANIZATION' penchant for developing college relievers into rotation members.",0
"GPE burst onto the national scene last summer hitting 100 mph at multiple events and flashing two plus breaking balls. That alone is enough to go on the first day if the health checks out, which GPE's does. The neutral aspect is that he's a maxed-out 6-foot-2, 200 pounds. The negative aspect is a very long arm stroke and as you might guess, a power approach rather than fine command. No prep prospect can be everything as an 18-year-old but GPE's velocity was 95-98, touching 100 this spring in early starts with lots of rest and was more 92-96 touching 97 when on normal rest. Pitchers lose velocity as they age, so many teams prefer a more conventional delivery and arm stroke, and a pitcher with average stuff and good feel who can grow into power stuff, rather than a power pitcher who has to learn feel only when his stuff declines. The recent track record of prep pitchers who hit 98-100 before the draft is riddled with injuries and command regression. With prep pitching being so subject to specific team tastes to try to avoid busts and attrition, many teams are out on GPE on Day 1 and others, particularly the more progressive clubs that value velo, spin rate, high octane stuff in shorter stints, and area control with that stuff, are interested in the 20s and 30s.",0
" Some scouts look at PERSON and see ORGANIZATION third baseman PERSON at the same age.Like the young GPE, PERSON is a hard-hitting infielder with a good projectable body and a strong arm. The infielder runs a 6.8-7.1-second 60-yard timed run and will likely end up as an average runner. It is his bat, arm and power that's expected to carry him through the ORGANIZATION ranks and to the big leagues one day.At the plate, PERSON has a good rhythm and a short, compact swing with plus bat speed. He has a chance to be an above-average hitter with above-average power. There's still some room to grow and get stronger, which leads some evaluators to think PERSON will eventually move from shortstop to third base and still develop into an above-average defender. He's been praised for his solid actions on defense and good body control. PERSON is from ORGANIZATION, GPE, and trains with PERSON. The ORGANIZATION are the favorite to sign the young infielder.",1
"GPE is the oldest player on The ORGANIZATION and he's only here, despite a career rife with injury and inconsistency, because his stuff is so good. He's among the hardest throwers in professional baseball and also one of the best at spinning the baseball. He is wild and the quality of his secondary stuff is inconsistent, but at times he looks unhittable. He struck out 33 in 23 big league innings last year, but he's currently on the ORGANIZATION with a forearm strain. He could one day pitch his way into high-leverage innings as long as he has this kind of stuff, which he has maintained despite the many maladies.",0
"The FACILITY Sox have been rebuilding their Latin GPE program since a bonus-skimming scandal ruined it in 2008, and their biggest move since then came in July 2013. PERSON landed PERSON, ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION. 2-ranked international prospect, for $1.6 million. He's still just 18, and scouts inside and outside the organization speculate that he could have been the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in the 2015 Draft if he were a GPE high school senior.Adolfo has immense power potential that results from bat speed, long levers, good loft in his right-handed swing and projectable strength. He's still learning at the plate, as evidenced by his Rookie-level ORGANIZATION League-leading 85 strikeouts in 46 games in his pro debut. He'll need to improve his pitch recognition to fully tap into his all-fields pop.Adolfo's arm strength is nearly as impressive as his raw power, making him a natural for right field. That's where he played in his debut, though he showed the aptitude for center field during instructional league and will get time more there in 2015. Presently a solid runner, he figures to lose a step once he matures physically.",0
"One of the taller and more projectable pitchers in the 2019 high school class, PERSON performed well while hitting most of the major stops on the showcase circuit last summer. Like most prep arms from the LOCATION, he's far from a finished product, but his potential is obvious. The ORGANIZATION clearly saw that, spending nearly twice the pick value in the third round with a bonus of nearly $1.25 million to sign the right-hander away from his commitment to the ORGANIZATION of Virginia.PERSON has an 89-93 mph fastball that tops out at 95 with riding life up in the strike zone. His 6-foot-6 frame and high-three-quarters arm slot provide plenty of downhill plane, and his size also creates extension that adds to the quality of his fastball package. He has high spin rates and good depth on his mid-70s curveball, which could be a hammer once he gains more velocity.PERSON has some sink on his changeup and while it's often too firm, it should improve as he throws it more often. Many tall, young pitchers have trouble keeping their deliveries in sync, but he repeats his mechanics well and provides strikes.",1
"The only player to appear on three world championship teams for ORGANIZATION, GPE, as a draft-eligible sophomore at FACILITY, was viewed as one of the more well-rounded college shortstops in the 2016 Draft. The ORGANIZATION selected him with the ORGANIZATION. 87 overall pick in the third round last June, signing him for $700,000.GPE does a lot of things fairly well, though no single tool is plus. He has a solid approach and makes consistent contact from the right side of the plate, albeit without power, and he can steal some bases now and again. He's a capable defender at shortstop, though most believe he'll need to move over to second base, where his below-average arm strength is a better fit, to have the chance to be an everyday player. He saw time at both middle-infield positions during his pro debut in the LOCATION, and that continued with the move up to full-season ball in 2017.The ORGANIZATION intend to give GPE the chance to stick at short, but his ability to play second should work in his favor and ultimately could help him carve out a role as a quality backup at both spots.",0
"Though PERSON was a left-handed pitcher with a fastball that could reach 94 mph, the ORGANIZATION preferred him as a hitter and spent $800,000 to sign him as a sixth-rounder out of a GPE high school in 2011. He fractured his right kneecap in his first pro game and missed all of 2012 after it didn't heal properly, though he made his way to Triple-A by age 22. The ORGANIZATION made him the ORGANIZATION. 2 overall pick in the 2015 Rule 5 Draft yet couldn't keep him, and GPE's glut of outfield prospects forced him to begin each of the last two seasons back in Double-A, but he has continued to persevere.While PERSON doesn't have a plus tool, he also doesn't have a glaring weakness. He has hit for average throughout the Minors, making consistent hard contact and using the entire field. After hitting just 11 homers in his first three full pro seasons, he has done a better job of using his lower half to generate power and set a career high for homers in 2017 despite missing most of the first month recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in March.PERSON's solid speed and average arm allow him to play all three outfield positions. After spending most of his time in center field earlier in his career, he has gotten most of his action in left field the last two years. While he may have a hard time claiming an everyday job with the ORGANIZATION, he could be a useful fourth outfielder.",0
"PERSON racked up 40 saves during his four years at ORGANIZATION and dominated for two summers on the Cape before signing with the ORGANIZATION as a 10th-round pick in 2017. He's enjoyed similar success in the professional ranks so far and began to move quickly in 2018, ascending three levels to reach Double-A in his first full season. The ORGANIZATION assigned him to Triple-A to open 2019, though early struggles in the ORGANIZATION led to a demotion back to Double-A Binghamton in June. PERSON' fastball is below-average from a velocity standpoint, sitting mostly in the upper 80s, but he consistently gets it past hitters thanks to deception created by his low arm slot. Said slot gives his effective slider broad sweeping action, while his changeup drops off the table as it approaches the plate. The change is the better secondary offering, one that receives above-average grades from scouts, and was instrumental in him holding left-handed hitters to a .167/.254/.294 clip in 2018. He's an adept strike-thrower with all three pitches, demonstrating above-average control and command against hitters on both sides of the plate.But perhaps what's most intriguing about PERSON is that he can induce whiffs with relative ease. Working 66 2/3 innings in his first full season, he struck out 37 percent of the hitters he faced while averaging 13 strikeouts-per-nine. PERSON doesn't fit into a neat box as a big league reliever, but there's something to be said about his sustained dominance, and it would surprise no one in the organization if he continued his accelerated climb towards the Majors.",0
"The ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON as a left-handed pitcher in the 31st round in 2014 out of GPE (Mo.) JC, where he was a two-way player, but he turned them down to transfer to PERSON. He had more success as a hitter with the ORGANIZATION and signed for $100,000 when the ORGANIZATION popped him in the 15th round as an outfielder in 2015. He led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with 83 RBIs during his first full pro season and ranked second in the high Class A GPE League with 92 last year while also hitting 21 homers and stealing 37 bases.He's a tooled-up, left-handed-hitting right fielder, prompting one club official to compare him to PERSON, though PERSON isn't nearly as polished at the plate as the greatest hitter in franchise history. His extra-large frame gives him an extra-long swing that resulted in 359 strikeouts in his first 320 pro games. He has 20-20 potential, with plus raw power that he began to tap into more last year when he began hitting more fly balls and the speed to match.Though he runs well enough to at least fill in as a center fielder, PERSON fits better in right. His arm delivered 88-92 mph fastballs in college and gives him a third plus tool.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have a terrific young catching tandem in PERSON and ORGANIZATION, who we project to play a glove-centric second fiddle to PERSON's bat for the next half decade. ORGANIZATION has been lauded for his defense since high school, and he remains excellent back there, and has a plus arm. He has struggled in the past to lift the ball, and while he showed some movement in that regard last year, it's unlikely that ORGANIZATION hits enough to profile as an everyday catcher.",1
"PERSON was a ""famous name"" entering the summer showcase circuit last year, one with major raw power at the plate, but whose future is most certainly on the mound. He was a bit inconsistent last summer, and then was pitching better for his GPE area high school to put an up arrow next to his name. A mild shoulder strain that shelved him for a while did put a damper on his spring.The 6-foot-4 southpaw has the ideal pitcher's body, with room to fill out and see his stuff tick upward, especially once he stops being a two-way player. His velocity fluctuated over the summer, but was up to 94 mph this spring with good arm-side movement. He'll flash an excellent slider, though he can get underneath it at times, impacting it's consistency, and he has good feel for an above-average changeup as well. While he was stronger this spring, PERSON still throws from a lower slot than some scouts would like. He struggles repeating his release point, which can lead to command issues.That arm slot does create deception in his delivery, though, often making him tough to hit. PERSON willing to take him early and sign him away from his ORGANIZATION of GPE commitment would have to believe there's more in the tank and that they can work with the lefty to clean up his delivery once he becomes a pro. But he was shut down for a period of time leading up to the GPE, leading many to believe he could end up heading to GPE.",0
"Sometimes, young prospects struggle when they make their GPE debut. PERSON, on the other hand, stood out immediately as a 20-year-old in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in 2014, then really took off in 2015 pitching across two levels of Class A ball and earning the organization's ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year honors. The jump to Double-A in 2016 proved to be a little more challenging.What makes PERSON's year stand out even more is the fact he did it while largely putting his best pitch in his back pocket. The right-hander has always been a strike-thrower with an outstanding changeup, but he bought into the ORGANIZATION' plan for him and focused on his slider all year, which undoubtedly hurt his strikeout rate. He'll show an average slider at times and the work he put into the pitch in 2015 should pay off in the future, moving it closer to his plus fastball and offspeed pitch. Clearly willing to do whatever it takes to make him a more complete pitcher, PERSON is learning what he needs to work on to succeed at the upper levels. The ORGANIZATION are excited to see what he can do there, with the hope they have a mid-rotation starter on their hands.",1
"May is on the way to becoming the third big leaguer in his family, following his grandfather PERSON and great-uncle PERSON, whose power made them All-Stars. PERSON's tools are similar to those of his father PERSON, a 1986 first-round pick of the ORGANIZATION who topped out in Triple-A. May reached that level in 2016, though he scuffled while battling an early-season oblique injury.One of the best athletes in a system loaded with toolsy outfielders, May is a switch-hitter whose game is built around plus-plus speed. He has some strength and hit eight homers in 54 games at ORGANIZATION A during his 2013 pro debut, but he has focused more on making contact since and went deep just four times in 2014-15. He's more effective from the right side of the plate and will need to draw more walks to fit at the top of a big league lineup.May has the speed and instincts to create havoc on the bases, and he stole 18 bases in May 2015 before he sustained a concussion after colliding with teammate PERSON while chasing a popup. His quickness also helps him in center field, where he has improved his route-running since entering pro ball. His arm is below average but not a liability in center.",0
"PERSON spent his first year plus at ORGANIZATION Poly coming out of the bullpen, but when he moved into the rotation 2017 during his redshirt sophomore year, teams sat up and noticed and his ORGANIZATION stock soared. Looking like a potential future big league starter, he landed in the second round and signed for below pick value with the ORGANIZATION, then impressed with his stuff during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League.The ORGANIZATION limited him innings-wise during that debut, but definitely opened some eyes by striking out 12.7 per nine over the summer. By the end, he was sitting 93-95 mph with explosive finish in the strike zone that allowed his fastball to play as well as anyone's in the system. He has an above-average slider and a solid cutter, and while his changeup is below-average he does have some feel for it. The right-hander generally threw strikes in college, though he struggled a bit with his control during his pro debut.PERSON's first impression with PERSON has the organization excited to see what he does for an encore. He attended strength camp last fall, with everyone eager to see what he can do when lengthened out over his first full season.",0
"Released by ORGANIZATION after a just over a year in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON is now an interesting, bite-sized arm strength prospect. The ORGANIZATION seemed to have lowered his arm slot this year and he's throwing really hard and throwing strikes. He's likely a relief prospect, but it makes sense to develop him as a starter in hopes that either his curveball or shangeup become an out pitch.",0
"PERSON possesses the footwork, actions and arm strength to remain at shortstop. He lacks any modicum of present strength at the plate and scouts need to project heavily on PERSON's body to see anything more than a bottom of the order hitter here, but some think the frame allows for it.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON committed to play for the ORGANIZATION after excelling for his PERSON team. A two-sport star, PERSON earned All-State honors in football as a defensive back, as well as All-Southern PERSON All-Stars honors and all-conference accolades on the diamond. The young infielder batted .465 with a slugging percentage over .700 for his high school and has played in numerous showcases. PERSON's arm is his best tool. He doesn't always get his foot down in time at the plate, but the ball jumps off his bat quickly when he makes contact.",0
"  After going undrafted out of high school, PERSON broke out during his sophomore year at ORGANIZATION. He became the ORGANIZATION ace and earned a spot on the GPE national team last summer.  PERSON primarily relies on his sinker, which sits around 90 mph with heavy life. He mixes in a slurvy slider and a changeup. He throws a lot of strikes and comes right after hitters with his fastball.  PERSON pitched out of the bullpen with the national team and could move quickly in the ORGANIZATION if he returned there. But with his feel for pitching and three offerings that have a chance to be at least average, he could develop into a Major League starter.",0
"Then with PERSON, GPE got red hot during the early part of 2017 and looked like he might be turning a corner. PERSON saw him as multi-positional infielder with good feel for contact, but were forced to revisit that evaluation when GPE had a long stretch during which he was also hitting for power. He was promoted, his performance regressed, and he was traded to PERSON for PERSON just before the 2018 season. It seems as though the upper levels of the minors have begun to take advantage of GPE' epicurean pitch selection, as his numbers continued to decline in 2018. His tools still indicate a utility and pinch-hitting role is possible, but GPE hasn't hit for a year and a half now, so we're less confident he gets there.",0
" Since coming out of the junior college ranks in 2010, GPE hasnât really been able to get going. Injuries havenât helped, as he missed most of the 2012 season following hip surgery. Some of the raw tools are there, particularly his speed, but he hasnât shown a consistent approach at the plate to get on base enough to use that speed. Heâs willing to work counts and take a walk, but heâs also struck out too much in the early stages of his career. More of a slap and run type, thereâs still hope he can develop into an average hitter who can play a good center field. Heâs young enough, but he needs to stay on the field and start making adjustments.",0
"PERSON won the gold-medal game for PERSON at the 2012 world 18-and-under championships, a prelude to becoming the third of three ORGANIZATION first-round picks a year later. Signed for $1,650,100 as the 33rd overall pick, he missed most of his pro debut with a sprained ankle but finished his first full pro season in Class A Advanced. He missed the 2015 regular season with elbow issues, however, before returning in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON has regained the low-90s fastball he had when he was fully healthy in 2014, but he doesn't have the same plus curveball. His changeup is now his best secondary offering, and he also has added a slider that rivals his present curve. Known for his precocious feel for pitching, he's throwing more strikes than ever this year.Though PERSON pitched just 80 innings in his first three pro seasons, he has surpassed that total in 2016 and is still advanced for his age. If he can stay healthy, he could start to move quickly and eventually become a mid-rotation starter.",0
"The ORGANIZATION gave PERSON a $160,000 bonus in November 2011 because they believed in his bat. He spent the first three years of his career in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION before making his GPE debut this spring. He broke out in May with eight home runs -- two more than he totaled in three ORGANIZATION seasons. PERSON's carrying tool is his left-handed power to all fields. While he does have some swing and miss in his game, he also has promising feel for hitting and a willingness to draw walks when pitchers try to work around him.PERSON began his pro career as a corner outfielder before seeing action at first base in 2013 and moving there full-time the following season. He's not especially quick but has some softness to his hands and some arm strength.",0
Max-effort player with lift-friendly swing. Likely to stay in the infield.,0
"The ORGANIZATION controversially signed PERSON to a $4.5 million bonus in February 2012 after he presented a different birthdate than he had previously, a move some clubs believed was designed to circumvent international bonus restrictions coming in the new Collective Bargaining Agreement. ORGANIZATION couldn't resolve his birthdate and decided to allow the transaction to stand but suspended him until July 2013. He had only sporadic success in his first two-plus pro seasons before finishing 2015 on a second-half tear, but he's struggling worse than ever in high Class A this year.PERSON earned his hefty bonus primarily because of his massive right-handed raw power, which he creates with bat speed and the leverage in his 6-foot-6 frame. He began to translate it into result more easily when he began to mature as a hitter while repeating low Class A last year, as he wasn't as pull-happy and did a better job of handling breaking pitches. He'll always have a long swing because has long arms and he has yet to show much plate discipline, which restricts his ability to hit for average.While PERSON runs well for his size, he won't be a basestealer and still is learning proper reads and routes on the outfield corners. He has a cannon arm that fits well in right field but his throwing accuracy needs to improve. He's a classic high-risk/high-reward ORGANIZATION prospect, and whether he'll pay off is a long way from being determined.",0
"It's easy to see why scouts like PERSON. He's a good runner with quick hands, a strong arm and the defensive tools that could make him an everyday shortstop one day. PERSON also like PERSON's footwork, his polished actions and his range to both sides. He makes all of the plays and has a good feel for the position.At the plate, PERSON makes consistent hard contact from both sides of the plate. He has shown good bat speed and a solid hitting approach. What's more, PERSON is a line-drive hitter now, but he could develop some pop as he grows and his body matures. His overall offensive game is expected to improve once he signs with a big league team and receives professional instruction daily. PERSON also like PERSON's makeup.PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION for $3 million in July but had his contract voided due to concerns with his physical, which were reportedly vision issues. He is trained by PERSON in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"GPE ORGANIZATION typically has a flush crop of high school pitching to consider every Draft year. The Class of 2016 is no different and while PERSON isn't the prototypical tall and projectable right-hander, his stuff has made scouts sit up and take notice.Just because PERSON isn't as big as some of the prep arms near the top of this list, that doesn't mean he lacks upside potential. He has seen his velocity spike this spring, firing his fastball up to 93 mph at times. He backs it up with a solid average curveball. Like with many high schoolers, PERSON's changeup is his third pitch. He has shown some polish and a repeatable delivery, with the hope that his feel for pitching should allow him to develop that third pitch. PERSON has been inconsistent with his fastball at times over the course of the spring, but there is room for him to add strength and he should be able to maintain velocity in the future.PERSON threw fairly well down the stretch, giving him a little boost. His stuff might have a ways to go, but his clean delivery and projectability has moved him solidly into top three round consideration.",0
"Like his fellow countryman PERSON, PERSON received a seven-figure bonus when the ORGANIZATION singed him out of GPE in July 2012. PERSON also made his professional debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2013 and held his own as a 17-year-old. He throws his fastball in the low 90s and mixes it with a changeup and curveball. His changeup is his best offspeed offering, though his curveball is improving. PERSON is athletic for his size and has shown the ability to make necessary adjustments already in his career. His loose, easy delivery should allow him to command all of his pitches well as he gets more experience on the mound.",1
"Signed out of GPE in 2013, GPE had a solid, albeit unremarkable debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2014. So when the infielder hit over .400 during his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION, then kept on raking after a bump up to the GPE, he surprised more than a few people.An offensive-minded middle infielder whose bat is a little bit ahead of his glove, GPE can really impact the baseball. He has some potential at the plate to hit for average and good extra-base pop, even if that doesn't mean a ton of home runs. He makes consistent hard contact with a fairly advanced approach. He's likely going to be an average runner once he physically matures and he has a chance to stay at shortstop with a plus arm and future average range. Still maturing, it's unclear how big GPE might get, but if he can't stay at short, he could be a good defender at second.For now, there's no talk of moving GPE to another position, though with shortstops like PERSON and PERSON also in the system, eventually something is going to have to give.",0
" PERSON is not PERSON, but that's the big league player he could resemble the most if all goes according plan. The 6-foot-2, 180-pound outfielder covers a lot of ground in the outfield, and he has the potential to hit for some power when he matures and receives regular instruction at a team's academy. PERSON like the teenager's big frame. PERSON is thin, but the belief is that he will fill out his body as he gets older. He projects to stay in center field.On offense, PERSON is known for showing quick hands, good balance and aggressiveness at the plate. Like many prospects his age, he needs to work on his approach against offspeed pitches and breaking balls, but evaluators who like him are confident he will get better with experience.A quick study, PERSON has only trained with PERSON at the ORGANIZATION and PERSON for just over a year. He is from GPE de los PERSON, GPE, and has been scouted heavily by several teams, including the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's brother PERSON is a Minor League pitcher for the ORGANIZATION.",0
"They say that youth is wasted on the young. In the case of GPE, who took a small step back developmentally in 2014, it looks like it could be a good thing as he's bounced back with a more productive 2015 season. The GPE left-hander is still a teenager, and was showing he learned lessons from 2014 while repeating the short-season LOCATION in 2014. The pure stuff is still very much there, so GPE has plenty to work with. He has a fastball that touches the mid-90s, his power breaking ball has the chance to be at least PERSON average and he has a decent feel for his changeup, especially given his age. GPE had a reputation as being much more polished than your typical teenaged pitcher, but his control and feel for pitching all regressed in 2014. Still, GPE is a big, strong lefty, albeit one who will have to watch his conditioning, with power stuff across the board. If he were pitching as an amateur at a junior college at this age, scouts would be flocking to watch him pitch. PERSON is still the key here for the ORGANIZATION.",1
"Following the same path top prospect PERSON did -- starting high school in the GPE, but then moving to the ORGANIZATION and signing as an international free agent -- PERSON's GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2015, followed by an even more successful jump to full-season ball in 2016, has the Cardinals thinking their $400,000 investment in 2014 was money well spent.PERSON lit up radar guns last summer, throwing his four-seamer in the 94-99 mph range and touching triple digits on occasion. But the teenager is more than just a thrower, with a solid feel for pitching. He'll throw a two-seamer with pretty good sink and shows an advanced feel for his changeup, an offspeed pitch that could be plus in time. His third pitch is his slider, which is fairly new to him. PERSON throws it with tight spin, but it's still inconsistent.His ability to command his fastball and changeup alone should allow him to succeed at some level. If the slider improves, PERSON has the chance to be a pretty special starter. If not, his power stuff certainly would work out of a bullpen. PERSON's combination of stuff and pitchability gives him the most upside of any pitcher in the system after PERSON.",1
"It hasn't been the quickest path to the big leagues for PERSON, a 2011 first-round pick out of the LOCATION high school ranks. Some of that has been because of how slowly he's developed and some of it is a result of the Reds not wanting to rush the hard-throwing right-hander, like they did with PERSON has always impressed stuff-wise, with execution -- specifically, command -- often holding him back. While his average velocity seemed to dip in 2015, it was more a result of him ramping it down too much in an attempt to find better control of a heater that still can touch the upper-90s. PERSON will still show flashes of a plus curveball, but vast improvement in his changeup has made that more of a go-to pitch.More than anything, it comes down to fastball command for PERSON. When he hits his spots, he still looks like a future frontline starter with three plus pitches at his disposal. Just 23 for all of 2016 and with PERSON in rebuilding mode, there's no reason to rush PERSON or to change his developmental path as a starter, though he was called upon to make his Major League debut in April.",1
"A three-year starter at ORGANIZATION, PERSON has probably had his worst season, statistically, in this, his junior season. But the speedy outfielder has shown enough where teams that covet college performers will still have interest in the top five ORGANIZATION's not that PERSON, a two-time Cape Cod League player, has been bad this spring; it's just that he set the bar high by winning the Big GPE's Freshman of the Year in 2016 and then Player of the Year in 2017. He's proven he can really hit, albeit from an unorthodox crouch from the left side of the plate. There is some raw power, but he doesn't tap into it consistently, focusing on line-drive contact and drawing a lot more walks than strikeouts. He's a plus runner who can handle center field with below-average arm strength, one who could one day hit near the top of a big league lineup.Even in his ""down year,"" PERSON has gotten on base at an impressive clip and stolen bases. That skill set, not to mention his track record, has kept him fairly high on GPE boards.",0
"King stood out as one of the best pitchers at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship last October, generating buzz as a potential first-rounder. He hasn't quite lived up to that billing this spring, though his powerful right arm still has attracted plenty of attention and helped keep GPE (GPE) atop the national high school rankings for much of the year until the ORGANIZATION lost in the state 6-A regional semifinals.After King threw several 94-95 mph fastballs at the ORGANIZATION event, scouts hoped he'd pitch there more consistently as a senior but he has worked mostly at 89-93. With his projectable frame and his quick arm, he eventually could operate in the mid-90s and approach 100 mph. His heater has running and sinking action that generates groundouts when he keeps it down in the zone.King's slider also was harder and sharper last fall but still shows flashes of becoming a solid offering. The ORGANIZATION recruit shows aptitude for a changeup with some fade as well. There's some effort in his delivery and he lands with a stiff front leg, which could compromise his health and his command and eventually lead him to the bullpen.",0
"PERSON profiles as a center fielder, and the belief is that he has the tools to keep him there.He's already a good runner -- he's consistently clocked in the 6.4- to 6.5-second range in the 60-yard run -- and he's expected to add strength to an already strong arm. He's displayed good instincts in the outfield and has impressed evaluators with his routes.PERSON is an aggressive hitter with some pop and he drives the ball to all fields. The ball jumps off of his bat now, and he is expected to have even more power in the future. PERSON still could end up in one of the corner outfield positions because of his size and overall skill set.The teenager is confident in his tools and scouts like his makeup. He has been compared to a young version of former big leaguer PERSON Rios.PERSON is from ORGANIZATION, GPE, and trains with PERSON. The ORGANIZATION are the favorite to sign him.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION traded PERSON to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON in mid-2013, GPE GM PERSON went on record to say that he didn't want to part with the right-hander. Pound for pound, there are few prospects who throw harder.Though he's just 5-foot-11 and 175 pounds, PERSON can pump consistent 92-95 mph gas as a starter. His fastball has reached 100 mph and features riding life. He also has three other pitches that can be average or better, with his mid-80s slider outclassing his curveball and changeup.PERSON started throughout his first three years as a pro but moved to the bullpen in June. He seemed destined to become a reliever because there's effort in his crossfire delivery and he lacks control and command. A fierce competitor, he could be a closer with an upper-90s fastball and an overpowering slider.",0
"PERSON was seen as a football-first prospect until late GPE 2018. He played at a couple of showcase events in the summer of 2017 and had some raw tools, but wasn't yet under consideration for the top few rounds of the baseball draft. He was, however, a top 100 football recruit, set to head to GPE to play wide receiver, where his father was on the coaching staff. Then in GPE, PERSON had a coming out party at the heavily-scouted ORGANIZATION tournament near his high school, fulfilling the rosiest hopes some had of him eventually putting it together on the baseball field, as multiple scouts from all 30 teams watched him against strong competition for a few days. Scouts were hesitant at first, worried they might be overreacting, but eventually came to think that PERSON' only athletic peer in recent draft history was PERSON. 
PERSON is a true 80 runner with raw power who projects to be a 60, and who flashed body and bat control that reminded scouts of PERSON. All of this excitement came with almost zero track record, and PERSON didn't face much strong competition after ORGANIZATION, meaning drafting him would be based purely on old-school scouting, as there weren't years of video of and performance from this flourishing incarnation of PERSON. Once teams became enthused enough that multiple millions of dollars were in play, it appeared clear that baseball could overtake football. Several ORGANIZATION, including the ORGANIZATION' GM PERSON, were in after ORGANIZATION to see PERSON for themselves, and after ORGANIZATION and PERSON were their top pick in consecutive years, rival executives now view this risk/upside kind of prospect as GPE' type. That trend appears to be more the result of opportunistic good fortune than a deliberate strategy, since there's an argument to be made that PERSON (who went to GPE sixth overall in 2017) had less upside and a similar performance record to PERSON; if the industry had simply seen PERSON play in an ORGANIZATION-style setting for a couple more weeks, he could have been a top five pick candidate, just like PERSON or PERSON were after a strong summer of performance. This is all to say that the sky is the limit for PERSON, and if he performs well in Low-A in 2019, he'll shoot up this list.",0
"The son of former 11-year Major Leaguer Fernando PERSON ranked 30th on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 prospects list for the 2015-16 international period before signing for $700,000 with the FACILITY, who shipped him to the Padres the following June as part of the PERSON trade. He made an immediate impact in his pro debut, finishing the season as a 17-year-old in the Class A Short-Season LOCATION, and then emerged as a top-flight prospect in 2017 as he became the first 18-year-old in ORGANIZATION history to post at least 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases. Perhaps even more impressive was how PERSON handled himself after making the jump directly to Double-A PERSON in GPE, and he continued to draw raves in his return to level in 2018 before undergoing season-ending surgery for a fractured thumb in late July.PERSON has all the ingredients to become an offensive force in the Majors, as his bat speed, leveraged swing and overall capacity to make adjustments all portend a future plus hitter with plus power. He proved vulnerable to spin and sequencing early in the year but tightened his approach as the season progressed en route to pacing the ORGANIZATION with 75 walks. Many evaluators believe PERSON is merely scraping the surface of his offensive potential, as he still has considerable room to grow into his tall and athletic frame. That larger frame doesn't currently impede PERSON's abilities at shortstop, where he makes highlight-reel plays on a daily basis thanks to his athleticism, range and rocket arm, though further physical development could ultimately force him to third base. Even if that's case, PERSON's bat gives him the ceiling of a perennial All-Star, possibly even an ORGANIZATION candidate in his prime.",1
"GPE, durable and on the smaller size, PERSON has a lot in common with players like PERSON and PERSON when the big leaguers were teens.Don't be fooled by PERSON's stature, this teen can play, and he has power now with the potential for more in the future. Among his biggest assets are his approach at the plate and his good bat speed through the strike zone. He consistently makes hard contact and he drives the ball to all fields. PERSON praise his smooth swing and hitting mechanics.The teen is plus runner who has the type of speed that can make defense rush their throws. He has the type of baseball instincts that can turn an errant throw into extra bases. On defense, he has the potential to be an above-average center fielder with an above-average arm. He already plays with confidence and performs well in games.PERSON trains with PERSON and participated in the ORGANIZATION in GPE.",0
"A two-sport star in high school, PERSON's pro baseball career was in doubt for a moment when the GPE discovered a stress fracture in his back during his physical after the draft. After the issue was resolved, PERSON took things slow for a while at the GPE complex in GPE, limited to activities like ORGANIZATION while others played in actual games. The sound of the ball off his bat during those ORGANIZATION side sessions was very distracting. PERSON stayed in GPE during the spring of 2017 and was much more physical than most of his ORGANIZATION peers. PERSON had statistical success there and in the ORGANIZATION League the following spring, before finally scuffling at Hi-A. 
Though he has above-average raw power, PERSON's in-game cut is more contact-oriented, geared for contact to the opposite field and back up the middle. During instructional league, PERSON was awkwardly swinging without a stride, likely not a swing change, but perhaps an exercise that forces him to clear his hips and improve his ability to pull the ball with power. There's a non-zero chance PERSON stays in center field but it's more likely that he moves to a corner. He has the physical ability to profile as a regular there.",0
"PERSON felt forearm tightness while throwing live batting practice to PERSON in late February, and five days later Dr. PERSON was reconstructing his ORGANIZATION. It was the first of several season-ending injuries Rays prospects would sustain early in the year, and it delayed PERSON's run at a potential Rookie of the Year award. A creative sequencer, PERSON's deep, unique repertoire is unlike any other pitcher in the minors. Though his fastball touches 98, his stuff is so diverse that he never has to pitch off of it. He can lob his curveball in for strikes, induce weak contact early in counts by throwing a cutter when hitters are sitting fastball, and he'll double and triple up on the changeup. What you see listed in PERSON's tool grades as a splitter is actually a screwball. It wobbles home in the 79-82 mph range, while his true changeup is usually a little harder than that. The screwgie is more than a gimmick and can miss bats, though itâs best in moderation because it's a little easier to identify out of his hand, and hitters are able to recognize it after seeing it multiple times in the same at-bat. PERSON's delivery is pretty violent and his TJ was not his first injury, but he's ready and has No. 2 or 3 starter stuff if it comes back after the surgery. He has been throwing off a mound since early December and should be pitching in games before April is through.",0
"A boiler plate middle relief prospect, PERSON was added to the 40-man this offseason and may debut in 2019. Though he has been developed as a starter to this point, command and repertoire depth limitations have scouts universally projecting PERSON to the bullpen. He has a slightly cross-bodied delivery, and he muscles up and slings in mid-90s fastballs and tilting, two-planed breakers. His changeup is firm, but continued reps in a rotation should help improve his feel for it and better prepare him to deal with left-handed hitters in the big leagues.",1
"After struggling so much at ORGANIZATION A Asheville that he was demoted to short-season Tri-City in 2012, PERSON returned to the LOCATION League in '13. All he did the second time around was win the ORGANIZATION and the batting title with a .343 average.An improved swing was crucial to PERSON's turnaround. With his mechanics smoother than before, he has begun driving the ball more and tapping into his raw power. PERSON is a switch-hitter and hits for average well from both sides, but his power mostly comes as a left-hander.PERSON has also improved defensively. Still, most scouts believe he will eventually outgrow shortstop. PERSON has played some third base already and could also fit at second base if he does have to change positions.",0
"The Phillies have been aggressive with the teenaged outfielder's assignments, and while PERSON's numbers don't jump out, the organization is pleased with his development.The main thing holding back PERSON's production has been his physicality, or lack thereof. He just needs to add strength, and he has been working tirelessly to do just that. When PERSON matures, he can then tap into his considerable tools. He has a fairly advanced approach at the plate and makes consistent contact. PERSON can cover a lot of ground in the outfield and has a strong arm, and he should be able to use his speed on the bases more effectively in the future.PERSON just needs time, and considering the ORGANIZATION will spend nearly all of the 2014 season at age 18, it is definitely on his side.",1
"PERSON (pronounced KIZ-ner) began his college career as a third baseman before moving behind the plate as a GPE PERSON sophomore. The ORGANIZATION, with a strong track record of finding college talent in the later rounds, nabbed PERSON in the seventh round of the 2016 Draft and signed him for $185,300. He made the jump directly from PERSON A to Double-A during his first full season, hitting .302 overall between the two levels, and then capped his year off with a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION. He followed it by hitting .313 and reaching Triple-A in 2018, earning a ORGANIZATION Game selection along the way. PERSON has shown a knack for barreling up the baseball as a pro, making lots of hard, line-drive contact to all fields en route to a .310 average in 242 games during his first three seasons. While his aggressive approach results in few walks, he also doesn't strike out much. PERSON's right-handed power is still developing and he should clear more fences as it does, though it's likely that he'll always have a hit-over-power profile.PERSON is athletic behind the plate but still learning the nuances of the position, especially in terms of his receiving and calling a game. His arm strength is only average but plays up because he's accurate, and he stands to improve his pop times even more with better footwork. With PERSON no longer in the picture after he was dealt to GPE in an offseason trade, PERSON seems poised to back up PERSON in the short term, with the potential to eventually succeed the veteran behind the plate.",1
"PERSON was a polished prep lefty with command of an advanced changeup and breaking ball, as well as an 88-92mph fastball that spiked into the mid-90s during his senior spring. Soon after his velo ticked up, PERSON got hurt and needed PERSON. The ORGANIZATION drafted him, gave him an over slot $1.4 million, and then traded him to Oakland the following year. PERSON has remade his physique and his pre-surgery surge in velocity has been retained. He was up to 98 at times last year, sitting 90-95 with advanced command. His changeup and breaking ball should mature into above-average pitches, and PERSON should move quickly through the minors as a potential mid-rotation starter.",0
"PERSON seems to have moved past a tumultuous first few chapters of his GPE tenure and settled into a seventh and eighth inning role. He blows upper-90s heat past hitters at the top of the zone and above it, and he generates flaccid swings at his slider when working away from righties. Once developed as a starter, the return of a third pitch might enable PERSON to be an elite reliever down the line, if he doesn't already have high-leverage stuff. He's under team control until 2025 and has unusually high trade value for a single-inning reliever, especially for teams unconcerned about his early issues.",0
"Seen as a safe pick, PERSON garnered some consideration for the first overall pick of the 2013 Draft before landing with the Marlins at ORGANIZATION. 6 overall. He was having a solid, if unspectacular, first full season when PERSON sent him to GPE in the ORGANIZATION deal.PERSON comes from a baseball family (his uncle, B.J. PERSON, and his brother, PERSON, have both played professionally), and he has a good understanding of the game. He is a pure hitter with an advanced approach. PERSON wonder how much power he will have, however, as his swing is more geared to produce line drives than home runs. PERSON is a below-average runner, but it doesn't hold him back defensively. He is sure-handed, and he has a strong arm.While PERSON's power will likely determine his impact, few doubt he will become a solid Major Leaguer.",1
"GPE for the 2011-14 Drafts but unpicked each year, PERSON has moved quickly since turning pro for $10,000 as a seventh-round senior sign from GPE in 2015. He reached Double-A less than a year after making his pro debut and has recorded a 3.02 ERA with 152 strikeouts in 134 innings in his first two pro seasons.While PERSON doesn't wow hitters or scouts with his stuff, he nevertheless has been effective. His fastball sits in the low 90s and maxes out at 95 mph, playing up because of his ability to sink and command it. He has a pair of average secondary pitches in a short slider and a changeup that helps him combat left-handers.PERSON helps his cause by throwing a lot of strikes and keeping the ball down in the zone. A prospect with more of a high floor than a high ceiling, he could fill a middle-relief role in GPE in the near future.",0
"PERSON PERSON threw the only perfect game in GPE history in 1987, and 31 years later his son PERSON joined him in the school record books with 18 strikeouts in one game. That's also the most whiffs in an ORGANIZATION Division I game this year and the performance gave another boost to his already rising PERSON stock. The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON as a 19th-rounder in 1989, while his son should go about 15 rounds higher this June. An unheralded recruit out of a ORGANIZATION high school, PERSON has added about 50 pounds in college and his stuff has gotten stronger as well. His fastball usually ranges from 91-94 mph and tops out at 97. But the key to his success is his low-80s slider, which can be a sharp, plus pitch at its best but also lacks consistency.PERSON's changeup is decent if a bit firm and should improve as he uses it more. He repeats his delivery well for a big guy and has no trouble filling the strike zone. His huge frame should lend itself to durability and adds to his profile as a potential innings-eating starter in the middle of a rotation.",0
"GPE has a big frame, smooth arm action and has run it up to 97 mph along with an above average curveball, so the starter traits and solid health indicators are there, but the lack of a plus secondary pitch has him in the second tier of prep arms.",0
"ORGANIZATION was a likely top-10 pick in the middle of the spring when his velocity jumped to 93-96, touching 97 mph, but he's fallen apart since, now sitting around 90 mph with no crispness and diminished command. Teams are worried he may be injured, but the ORGANIZATION camp will not be providing medical information to teams.",0
"The PERSON video is from when I scouted his second appearance in front of scouts back in February, also the last open showcase for ORGANIZATION IF PERSON before he got $62.5 million. PERSON wasnÃ¢â¬â¢t a big name in GPE and never played in their top pro league. I heard rumors after his first appearance for scouts two weeks prior to my look that he hit 98 mph, but you take that type of buzz with a grain of salt in the international market. He hit 98 mph again in the outing I went to on one scoutÃ¢â¬â¢s gun, hit 97 mph multiple times on every gun, sitting at 93-96 mph over his two innings. As you can see in the video (from his second inning when I moved down to get a closer look) the slider is plus and the changeup is surprisingly good, flashing 55, and PERSON used it multiple times in two strike counts and against right-handed hitters. While the command isnÃ¢â¬â¢t all the way there yet, heÃ¢â¬â¢s only 18 with new velocity that heÃ¢â¬â¢s still adjusting to, while the delivery, arm, frame and athleticism are all solid to very good with some flashes of feel to pitch already.

He projects as a starter, but the risk here is due to the uncertainty. PERSON has been throwing this hard for less than a year, scouts haven't seen him go deep into games or face high end minor league hitters. Sometimes young arms with velo spiking develop injuries or simply can't command it and we haven't seen enough to know if this sort of thing will happen to PERSON. He checks all the boxes for a pitcher of this age and youÃ¢â¬â¢d obviously like to see more than what scouts have seen, but that's the way this market works and PERSON will get paid even with little track record. It would be an unnecessary risk to expose himself to, and teams would rather handle his throwing program themselves than have an agent do it. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s too early to really know what heÃ¢â¬â¢s capable of, but the raw talent here is comparable to the top teenage arms in the world.

The buzz is PERSON already has a deal in place for $16 million with the ORGANIZATION and this type of buzz is sometimes wrong, but very often ends up pegging the right team and the right general range for the bonus. The ORGANIZATION' heaviest of hitters, president PERSON and ORGANIZATION were sitting about 20 feet behind me while I shot the video, were the highest-ranking scouts at the event and have already signed the other elite player that was on the field in GPE. PERSON projects as a potential frontline starter that would go in the top half of the first round in the domestic draft, but the uncertainty here is much higher than comparably-aged domestic prospects due to the lack of track record. After ten starts in pro ball, PERSON could be one of the top pitching prospects in the world, or just another teenage pitcher with a talented arm and feel issues to sort out at the lower levels of the minors.",0
"Left-handed hitting third basemen are always a hot commodity, so when PERSON carried over a strong Cape Cod League season into his junior year at FACILITY, he became a sure-fire first-rounder, one who could eventually man the hot corner for the ORGANIZATION in the GPE. He has legit pop, showing it with wood in the Cape as well, and should hit for both average and power in the future. While some worried about his ability to stay at third in the past, PERSON showed good defensive improvement in 2013 and answered some of those questions. The ORGANIZATION certainly had no plans to move him and he should fit the profile of a run-producing third baseman very well.",0
"Signed for $400,000 by the ORGANIZATION out of the ORGANIZATION in 2012, PERSON made quite an impression in his professional debut the following summer as he led the ORGANIZATION in batting average (,348) and ORGANIZATION (1.023). He continued his success as he made his GPE debut in 2014, reaching Class A LOCATION as an 18-year-old. After the season, the D-backs acquired him in the three-team trade that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON has an advanced approach for such a young player, showing deft control of the strike zone and the ability to hit line drives all over the field. As a bonus, he's a switch-hitter, and he has the potential to produce double-figure home run power once he adds strength. An average runner, PERSON fits best at second base but has also played shortstop in the ORGANIZATION. He has good defensive instincts and reliable hands to go with average arm strength and range.",1
"As a ORGANIZATION high schooler in 2013, PERSON turned down seven-figure overtures from big league clubs and passed when the ORGANIZATION took him in the 31st round so he could attend GPE. After looking like a potential future first-rounder during his first season and a half with the ORGANIZATION, he blew out his elbow and needed PERSON surgery in mid-2015. He sat out the entire 2016 season, turned down GPE again (this time in the 21st round) and returned to GPE and reasserted his status as a prospect this year en route to a second-round selection by the ORGANIZATION.PERSON has regained his velocity after having his elbow reconstructed, working at 92-95 mph and hitting 97 with nice sink. His curveball can be a plus pitch, thrown with power and depth when it's on, and he also can miss bats with his slider. His changeup shows some promise of becoming another solid offering, though it too requires more consistency.PERSON has a history of throwing strikes and had no problems regaining his command this spring. His large frame earns him PERSON comparisons, and while he's not terribly athletic, his delivery works well. The ORGANIZATION may bring him along slowly given his medical history and spring workload, but PERSON has the size, stuff and feel to develop into a mid-rotation starter.",0
"There is no question PERSON's glove is good enough to play in the big leagues. What kind of player he'll be in the long run will likely come down to how much the offensive side of his game develops.Signed out of GPE in 2011, PERSON is the best defensive shortstop in the system currently and perhaps in recent memory. He has a very strong arm and outstanding range to both sides. He's worked hard to improve his running, with his modest strength gains helping in that regard, and he's become a basestealing threat. With a smallish, lean frame, there's a limit to what he's able to add, but more good weight and strength will be necessary for him to hit at higher levels. He does have a good swing and barrels up balls fairly consistently, so if he can get stronger, he has a chance to hit enough.With his defensive ability, he doesn't need to hit a ton. Showing he's not going to have the bat knocked out of his hands might be enough for him to be a glove-first everyday shortstop in the big leagues.",1
"PERSON had a spectacular breakout 2017 campaign, hitting 32 homers and 32 doubles split between Hi and Double-A, prompting GPE to give him a look in the Majors in September. His hands are electric and allow PERSON to turn on just about everything, and he tries to, which prompted big league pitchers to work him down and away. It may take an approach adjustment for PERSON to max out his offensive potential as he's overly aggressive and his style of hitting may be exploited in the Majors. But he has bat speed and power and should play an above average right field (or be better than PERSON in center) fairly soon.",1
"Signed out of GPE in 2010, PERSON spent two seasons in the ORGANIZATION before finally making his stateside debut as a starter in '13. The ORGANIZATION hoped that a move to the bullpen the following year at ORGANIZATION A PERSON might accelerate his development. Instead, the right-hander's control problems worsened, ultimately limiting him to just 51 2/3 innings over 35 appearances from 2014-15. PERSON put all of that behind him in 2016, when he enjoyed a breakout campaign in the ORGANIZATION A Advanced California League and then added to his workload in the ORGANIZATION, where his fastball was consistently 97-100 mph and touched 102. His power curveball in the low 80s has come on strong in the last year as well, giving him the necessary two pitches to profile as a late-inning arm in the big leagues. The gains PERSON made last season with his control may have been significant, but his overall efficiency, especially in terms of getting ahead of hitters, leaves much to be desired. That being said, even a modest improvement in that department could help PERSON, who's already on the ORGANIZATION' 40-man roster and likely to begin the season at ORGANIZATION, surge towards the Majors in 2017.",1
"GPE tied a GPE high school record by hitting 25 homers in 2011. He has hit 31 long balls in three seasons at ORGANIZATION while playing three different primary positions: third base as a freshman, catcher as a sophomore and shortstop (because the team needed him there) as a junior this spring.GPE has two tools to bank on: raw power and raw arm strength. He has a short, handsy stroke and a mature approach at the plate, which should allow him to tap into his pop in pro ball. Though he had a long release as a catcher, he still threw out 51 percent of basestealers in 2013, when he capably handled first-round pick PERSON Gonzalez.The downside to GPE catching is that he wore down behind the plate and his offense suffered. He's definitely not a shortstop, because he lacks quickness and throws from a low slot while there, though to his credit he made just two errors in 56 games this season. Some scouts think he might be able to make it as a power-hitting second baseman, and his work ethic will help him wherever he winds up.",0
"It's possible PERSON would have been PERSON's best everyday option at catcher toward the end of last year, but a desperate need for pitching depth facilitated his trade to PERSON for PERSON. PERSON is an athletic catcher with a plus arm, average receiving skills, and some feel to hit. After struggling to perform with the bat during the first several years of his career, PERSON has two straight season of league-average offensive performance at ORGANIZATION and Triple-A. He has a pull-and-lift style of hitting, but not enough raw power to optimize that kind of approach. He's a safe bet to be a quality backup and has a non-zero chance to hit a little more than we expect and be a low-end regular.",0
"PERSON has a long track record of producing at top amateur events, including getting two hits off GPE's PERSON (now with the ORGANIZATION) in the gold-medal game of the 2014 15-and-under World Cup. He led Deerfield-Windsor High (PERSON, Ga.) to state 3-A titles in 2015 and 2016 and to the semifinals this spring. A club that believes he can stay behind the plate could take him as high as the third round, though there are enough questions about his defensive ability that he could wind up sliding far enough to follow through on his commitment to Auburn.There aren't many worries about PERSON' offensive ability. With his sound left-handed swing, bat speed and strength, he could hit for both average and power. He has enough offensive upside that he could profile at an outfield corner or first base if he doesn't make it as a catcher.PERSON has the strong arm and the desire to make it as a catcher, but his receiving will need a lot of improvement. Some teams wonder if he'd be better off focusing on his hitting and moving to the outfield. He has enough arm for right field, though his below-average speed might make him a better fit in left.",0
"He could have gone in the top three rounds in 2016 had he been signable as a GPE high schooler, but PERSON withdrew his name from the ORGANIZATION because he wanted to attend PERSON. He has performed capably for three years with the ORGANIZATION, though he never has dominated as much as hoped. He ascended to the front of ORGANIZATION's rotation this year but got knocked around in GPE Coast Conference play.PERSON can display four pitches that earn solid or better grades at their best. As a starter, he works at 90-92 mph and reaches 94 with his fastball, creating some armside run with some crossfire in his delivery. He uses his high-three-quarters arm slot to stay on top of an upper-70s curveball that is often his best pitch, and he also can manipulate it into a harder, more lateral-breaking slider in the low 80s.PERSON also has at least an average changeup with some fade and is doing a much better job of throwing strikes in 2019, enhancing his chances of remaining a starter in pro ball. He has a high floor as a potential No. 4 starter with a fallback of becoming at least a seventh-inning reliever. He has reached 97 mph with his fastball coming out of the bullpen and could have a more consistent plus curveball in shorter stints.",0
"Counting a big league contract for since-traded Hector PERSON, bonuses and tax penalties for blowing past their allotted pool, the ORGANIZATION agreed to pay more than $150 million to sign international players in 2015. Their spending spree continued into November, when they landed PERSON for $15.5 million (plus a matching amount in tax penalties). That was just GPE' third-biggest outlay of the year for a GPE defector, behind $62.5 million for PERSON and $32 million ($16 million bonus plus matching penalty) for right-hander PERSON Alvarez.PERSON hit .348/.448/.440 in 2014-15 as an 18-year-old in GPE's top league, the ORGANIZATION, and was the favorite to win PERSON of the Year honors before he defected in April before the award was given. His most impressive attribute may be his hand-eye coordination, which combined with his quick right-handed bat, allows him to barrel balls. He mainly focuses on lacing line drives from gap to gap but has the strength to provide some power if he opens up his approach. A good athlete, PERSON has plus speed and solid arm strength. He should be able to stick in center field and is capable of playing all three outfield spots.",0
"PERSON spent two summers in the ORGANIZATION after signing out of the GPE in 2011. The slightly undersized right-hander didn't disappoint in his highly anticipated stateside debut in 2014, when he showed the ability to miss bats with electric stuff en route to recording 10.1 strikeouts per nine innings in the Rookie-level PERSON. The ORGANIZATION expected big things from him in 2015, though he was unable to take the next step as an avulsion fracture in his elbow limited him to just 20 innings. He finally made his full-season debut in 2016, pitching as part of a loaded piggyback starting rotation at ORGANIZATION A Wisconsin. In December, he was selected by the Twins with the first pick in the Rule 5 Draft, only to be traded to GPE.  When healthy, PERSON's lightning-quick arm generates a fastball in the mid-90s with late movement from a high three-quarters slot. His slider, thrown in the 75-77 mph range with good lateral action, has the chance to be an out pitch if he can throw it for strikes. His changeup lags behind his two other offerings, but club officials believe it will become an effective third pitch for him once he creates better velocity separation relative to his heater. He has the ability to miss bats naturally, though his control and command require refinement, as does his mechanics. PERSON's elbow injury required subsequent surgery, but he was not limited by the injury in 2016. Although the ORGANIZATION may continue to develop him as a starter, his fastball-slider pairing gives him undeniable upside in a late-inning bullpen role.",1
"PERSON signed with the D-backs for $1.85 million at the outset of last year's international period after he had ranked as the ORGANIZATION. 19 prospect in his class. He impressed evaluators as a GPE amateur with a combination of athleticism and overall tools that could help him stick in center field. PERSON has a pair of standout tools in his speed -- he was clocked at showcases in the 6.6- to 6.7-second range in the 60-yard run -- and arm strength that might have been the best among players in his class and is expected get even stronger as he develops. Projecting his impact at the plate will require more time, as PERSON won't make his pro debut until 2019, but he shows the signs of having the requisite athleticism and skills to develop a promising speed-power combo. PERSON is all projection right now, but he has the type of athletic body scouts covet, not to mention defensive abilities that could keep him on the field even when he struggles at the plate.",1
"GPE PERSON has sent two dozen players to the big leagues in the ORGANIZATION era but has never had a first-round pick, a void that PERSON will fill in June as one of the first college position players selected. Undrafted and lightly regarded as a ORGANIZATION high schooler, he reached double figures in homers and steals as a sophomore in 2016. He also impressed with PERSON last summer, with some scouts considering him the best position prospect on the squad, and continued to show all-around tools this spring.PERSON is an on-base machine thanks to his speed (which earns well-above-average grades from some evaluators) and patient approach. A left-handed hitter, he does swing and miss a bit much for a player with a leadoff profile because he can get overly aggressive at times, especially against breaking pitches. Though he didn't go deep in 64 at-bats with wood bats on PERSON, he packs some sneaky power in his athletic frame and could produce 20 or more homers per season in the big leagues.PERSON also uses his quickness well to steal bases and track down balls in center field. He throws better than most players at his position -- his fastball reached 92 mph when he was a high school pitcher -- and his makeup is another positive in his favor. The most common comparison is PERSON, though PERSON had less pop and more speed at the same stage of his career.",0
"ORGANIZATION went from two homers as a ORGANIZATION sophomore to 18 (fourth in ORGANIZATION Division I) as a junior in 2015, and his power surge propelled him into the sixth round. He has continued to mash as a pro, smacking 51 homers in his first two full seasons while reaching Triple-A. Unfortunately for him, he's blocked by All-Stars Cody Bellinger and PERSON at his two best positions.With strength and solid bat speed, the left-handed-hitting ORGANIZATION creates power to all fields that plays against both lefties and righties. Though he's very aggressive and doesn't have much of a gameplan at the plate, his hand-eye coordination allows him to make consistent hard contact. He may never walk much, but he can hit for power and average.ORGANIZATION has a strong arm but lacks speed and quickness and thus defensive value. He spent most of his first two years as a pro at third base but had limited range and was error-prone. He works hard enough to become adequate at first base, where he saw more action in 2017, when he also looked better than expected if not particularly rangy on the outfield corners.",0
"There's nothing like a no-hitter at a Regional to raise your profile a bit. Truth be told, PERSON would be high on radar screens anyway with his pure stuff, though some inconsistent performances during his junior season kept him from being among the top few college pitchers on this list. He has a plus fastball that can touch 96 mph and throws a hard breaking ball to go along with it, a combination he used well for PERSON over the summer. PERSON is strong with a good delivery and arm action. As big as his stuff is, though, he will have to learn to soften it up somehow in the future. Everything he throws is hard, and the ability to change speeds more effectively will be a necessary skill to refine going forward.",0
"PERSON entered last summer as perhaps the top player in the entire class, and certainly among the high school set. A combination of a relatively pedestrian summer showcase performances and an extremely high expectation bar, a trend that has continued this spring, caused his star to fade, though he's still one of the better prep players in the nation.PERSON does everything fairly well, though a lack of a true plus carrying tool is one reason why scouts were a bit down on him. Most feel he has the chance to be a plus hitter with an advanced approach at the plate using a high-contact, line-drive spray kind of approach. With a lean frame, there is some question about how much strength he'll add, with believers thinking power will come. Most feel he is a long-term shortstop, though some don't see it as a slam dunk. Some feel PERSON suffered more from being seen for so long that he was bound to get knocked simply for not being the best player on the field at all times. Others haven't seen him dominate the way they feel a top-of-the-Draft prospect should in high school. He is committed to ORGANIZATION, which could become an issue depending on when he's selected.",0
"PERSON went to ORGANIZATION planning to play both football and baseball, but the school's football program was shut down when he got to campus, and he was drafted and signed by PERSON before it was reborn. He practiced with the team, but never suited up for a football game. 
2018 was his first year of full-time baseball and he hit .307/.378/.552 with 17 homers and 29 steals, albeit as a 22-year-old at Low-A. His strength/raw power and straight-line speed are what you'd probably expect from a college wide receiver, but PERSON's compact, in-game swing prioritizes contact. He's predictably raw and somewhat stiff rather than graceful and coordinated but he has physical ability, he plays really hard, and there's a chance some of the skill-based parts of the game come to him in his mid-20s.",0
"There are amateur shortstops that can stay up the middle. Then there are those who will likely need to move to third base. PERSON fits in the latter category, but it looks like he has the profile for the hot corner.Big and strong, PERSON was putting up gaudy numbers during his junior season to move up ORGANIZATION boards as the spring progressed. The ball jumps off of his bat, and he projects to have plenty of power for the position. He has good defensive reactions, which should work just fine at third, and he has a very strong arm.PERSON looks the part, a tall and lean athlete who used to play quarterback in the GPE high school ranks. He's not among the few elite college bats in this class, but he's not too far behind them, either.",0
"GPE's early-season domincane of Double-A should be taken with a grain of salt as he was significantly older than is usual for prospect at that level. As a left fielder, his bat might fall just shy of profiling and he could be best used as a utility or platoon option.",1
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 4, 2017 - PERSON, Calif.Favorite MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON commit, PERSON is touted as a catching prospect, though he has played multiple positions in high school. He was named to the 2016 Underclass 2nd Team and has played in two ORGANIZATION World Championships in the past.PERSON has a high leg kick at the plate and will over-swing at times, but he makes decent contact, and scouts note his aggressive approach. In the field, he has a slightly below average arm, but it should get better as he has more time to develop.",0
"PERSON has done nothing but impress since the ORGANIZATION signed him for $225,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2013. In his stateside debut last season, the 18-year-old tore up the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League to force a promotion to Class A Short-Season Auburn, where he was the youngest everyday player in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League. PERSON' stock has continued to soar this year in his full-season debut, as he was promoted to Class A Advanced Potomac after just 64 games with PERSON. PERSON is a potentially special talent who showcases all five tools along with elite athleticism on a daily basis. He shows the makings of a plus hit tool, thanks to his compact but explosive swing and feel for using the whole field, and scouts rave about his advanced approach and strike-zone judgment. A plus-plus runner, PERSON' speed enables him impact games on the bases as well as in center field, where he has range for days in all directions and arm strength that's among the best in the Minors at the position.Beyond the athleticism and physical tools, the ORGANIZATION love PERSON' makeup and overall baseball aptitude, both of which make him a leader in the clubhouse. He might still be a few years away from reaching the ORGANIZATION, but there is reason to be excited about the kind of player he could become.",1
"After his freshman year at GPE, PERSON seemed like a sure-fire top-of-the-Draft prospect for 2017. An inconsistent 2016 season, combined with a lack of work behind the plate, leaves his status a little bit more up in the air.The son of one-time big league pitcher PERSON, J.J. still has tremendous offensive potential. He's shown he has raw power to all fields. While there was swing-and-miss to his game in 2016, he also showed a willingness to work walks and get on base. He has the tools to catch, with good hands and a solid average arm, but he hasn't, and won't, catch that much because of PERSON's presence on the ORGANIZATION. PERSON went to the Cape last summer to catch, but he left after 13 games due to a minor injury.If PERSON gets some time behind the plate and shows he can catch, that will obviously help his value. But even if not, if his bat returns to freshman form, he could be one of the first college position player to come off the board.",0
"PERSON capped his trip through the showcase circuit in the summer of 2010 with an ORGANIZATION performance in the ORGANIZATION All-America Game at FACILITY. After a slow start to his professional career, he advanced to full-season ball for the first time in 2013.PERSON's power is his best tool. He creates good bat speed and he can drive the ball to all areas of the field. PERSON is a below-average runner, but he takes advantage of opportunities to be aggressive on the basepaths.PERSON made big strides on defense in 2013. Combined with his strong arm and his good makeup, the improvements PERSON made to his receiving give him a chance to be at least an average defender. With his power, that would make PERSON an all-around threat.",0
"One of the best on-mound athletes in the 2018 AZL, PERSON is a converted shortstop with a delivery that looks an awful lot like PERSON's. The ORGANIZATION acquired him on 40-man crunch day from GPE for depth starter, PERSON. PERSON sits only 88-92, but that should tick up as he physically matures. His fastball has natural cut, and at times, he throws what looks like a true cutter in the 84-87 range. He also has a 12-to-6 curveball that flashes plus. 
PERSON could develop in a number of different ways. PERSON could make a concerted effort to alter his release so PERSON is more behind the ball, creating fastball life/rise that would probably play better with his curveball. Alternatively, they might nurture his natural proclivity for cut, and see what happens. Either way, this is an exciting athlete with workable stuff who'll be 19 all summer. He has a chance to start, which is why he's ahead of several other arms on this list who throw harder/are closer.",0
"A 20th-round pick who signed for $20,000 out of ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION.) PERSON in 2012, ORGANIZATION enjoyed a breakout year in 2014. He earned ORGANIZATION honors at the low Class A ORGANIZATION All-Star Game and boosted his numbers after a promotion to Class A Advanced, though he then was suspended for 50 games after testing positive for an amphetamine. He came back to perform well in the ORGANIZATION before the ORGANIZATION acquired him in a trade that sent PERSON and ORGANIZATION to the A's in January.While ORGANIZATION draws praise for his ability to play bigger than his size and his tools, his physical ability shouldn't be sold short. He has solid speed and center-field skills, and he has controlled the strike zone very well in pro ball.The biggest concern scouts have with ORGANIZATION is that his swing tends to get long and they wonder how it will work against better pitching. He doesn't have much power and his arm is just fringy, yet he could fit the center-field profile well if he can continue to get on base.",1
"Five years after PERSON went No. 1 overall in the PERSON, PERSON has another hard-throwing right-hander poised to go in the first round. Unlike PERSON, PERSON was a prospect in high school, too, though signability knocked him down to the 41st round in 2011. He can light up a radar gun like no other college arm in this year's PERSON, as he's capable of working in the mid 90s and hitting 98 mph with his fastball, with triple-digits within reach in shorter stints. PERSON has a lot of moving parts in his delivery and still is learning to control his 6-foot-6 frame, so he lacks consistency with the rest of his pitches as well as his control and command. His low-80s slider has the most potential of his secondary offerings, and he also throws a curveball and a changeup. PERSON moved to the bullpen this spring and was throwing well as PERSON's closer. If he can't develop a reliable second weapon and do a better job of locating his pitches, that could be his long-term role at the next level.",0
"GPE and lean with dream-worthy frame, GPE is raw in all facets of baseball but at times shows glimpses of a future at shortstop and the body allows for projection on his bat.",0
"PERSON had been a reliever during his junior year at ORGANIZATION when the ORGANIZATION took him in the third round of the 2012 Draft, but GPE developed him as a starter. After moving incrementally in that role, a return to the bullpen in 2015 had PERSON really pointing in the right direction when GPE sent him to the D-backs in the ORGANIZATION trade. PERSON gave him one start at the very end of the season.As a starter, PERSON would try to mix in four pitches, with a fastball, slider, curveball and changeup. As a reliever, he leaned largely on his fastball and slider, both of which are PERSON average offerings. He still mixed in a changeup on occasion to keep hitters honest. PERSON has always had solid control, but it ticked up a notch when he was throwing shorter stints. The 25-year-old right-hander doesn't have the stuff to close, with a middle relief role more likely if he sticks in the bullpen. For now, though, the D-backs are planning on giving him another crack at pitching in a rotation.",0
"It's uncommon for a college hitter to have more walks than strikeouts during his career but PERSON' ratio during his junior season at PERSON was exceptional. He walked 52 times and struck out just 16 while also swiping an ultra-efficient 25 bases in 26 attempts. He's a nearly plus-plus runner and capable middle infield defender (probably at second) with premium hand-eye coordination and bat control. There was some concern that PERSON beat up on small conference pitching his entire career, and that he may not replicate that performance against pro pitching, but we're buying it. Once poised to perhaps move quickly through the system, PERSON had posterior labrum surgery in late-March and will miss much of the season.",0
"Projectable frame, great body control and arm strength. Looks likely to stay at shortstop and might be plus there. Plus bat speed, has some swing and miss tendencies.",0
"PERSON signed for $500,000, which puts him behind the top tier of signees in the 2017 class for the ORGANIZATION. But his tools are arguably just as exciting, though more riskier. He's 6-foot-5 or 6-foot-6 depending on whom you ask and is only listed at 205 pounds, but is north of that and will get bigger. If he doesn't have 80 raw power now, he will in the next few years, and he's actually an average runner underway, though his first step isn't great and he'll lose a step or two with maturity. PERSON has the arm to profile in right field, but down the road, he'll likely be an average glove there at best. There's obvious leverage to his swing and he hit 10 homers in 44 games in the ORGANIZATION as a 17-year-old, so it's not like he's sushi raw at tapping into his best tool. PERSON had similar tools at this stage, so that's one way this can go. Another would be former Tigers prospect PERSON, who played last year in GPE. There are also two massive corner outfielders with 80 raw power currently in the big leagues for the ORGANIZATION, so you know what PERSON looks like if everything goes perfectly, but a 42% strikeout rate in GPE ball isn't the best starting place from which to get there.",0
"The younger brother of ORGANIZATION prospect, and 2015 third-round pick, PERSON, PERSON has been a bit of a pop-up prospect in northern GPE, with cross-checkers and scouting directors running in to see him as reports of his athleticism came in.A football standout who had verbally committed to play on the gridiron as a preferred walk-on at his brother's alma mater, the ORGANIZATION of GPE, PERSON changed courses before the spring and decided to commit to PERSON for baseball, where a scholarship is waiting. The way he's shown at times this spring, he may never get there. At 6-foot-4, 190 pounds, scouts love his athletic body and his power-speed combination. He can really fly, both on the bases and in the outfield, though a below-average arm might push him to left field. He has some ability with the bat as well, with some power potential, all of which could be unlocked if and when he focuses solely on baseball.PERSON is the kind of high-ceilinged athlete teams can dream on. With that potential does come some risk, but it's one several teams will be interested in taking in June.",0

A GPE ORGANIZATION All-Star in 2015, the GPE Rican-born backstop appeared to be having a breakout season in the PERSON League in 2016.When PERSON was drafted, he was known mostly for his raw power. He would often sell out for power, trying to pull everything with an all-or-nothing swing from the right side of the plate. He's improved his overall approach, cutting down his strikeouts considerably while trying to use all fields more consistently. Strongly built, PERSON's work behind the plate has also improved in 2016, a year after he was charged with 14 errors. He's throwing out baserunners at a higher rate while working to improve his receiving and game-calling skills.If the 22-year-old can continue to show improvement on both sides of the ball, his prospect stock will continue to rise.

His strong arm and defensive skills give him the chance to man all three outfield spots.",0
"After a strong sophomore season at ORGANIZATION, scouts were excited to see what PERSON could do to raise his profile as a power-hitting third basemen. He's still considered one of the better college bats out west, but after transferring to PERSON in the ORGANIZATION, it's become a bit tougher to evaluate his performance.The left-handed hitter reminds some of a young Chase Utley in terms of body type. There is some pop in his bat as he reached double-digits in home runs as a sophomore and had easily surpassed that with PERSON in 2016. At times, he's looked like a middle of the order corner bat, while there are other instances where he hasn't been as consistent and figuring out how his bat will play is more difficult while watching him against ORGANIZATION competition. He is athletic and should be able to stay at third, with a strong arm that fires 93-94 mph fastballs as PERSON's closer.A team that takes PERSON early will be one that believes in the bat based on what he did at ORGANIZATION as well as with PERSON this year. A lack of impact bats at the college level will undoubtedly help his stock.",0
"Typically, pitchers who are college senior signs are who they are, without much projection or upside. But as much as PERSON fits the bill as a smart right-hander from the ORGANIZATION of GPE, the surprising strides he's made since the 2011 Draft have made him a more intriguing prospect.PERSON's velocity has improved over time, and he'll now throw his fastball in the 91-94 mph range, with hard sink. He throws a slider and a changeup, both of which are now PERSON average pitches. He throws a lot of strikes, with a 2.3 BB/9 ratio in his career entering the 2015 season, thanks to a mechanically sound delivery he repeats well. His best grades are given for his makeup, which is described as ""off the charts.""The hard-working PERSON really knows how to pitch and has been very durable, with a chance to be a back-end starter in the near future.",0
"A senior sign out of GPE taken in the 13th round of the 2014 Draft, GPE maximized his stuff with tremendous movement and command to reach the highest level of the ORGANIZATION' system in 2016, finishing fourth in the organization in ORGANIZATION. PERSON sent him to the D-backs last February in return for infielder PERSON and he spent most of 2017 in Triple-A, but struggles in PERSON led to a move down to Double-A for the final month of the season.Based on velocity alone, GPE's fastball wouldn't even grade out as an average pitch, topping out at 90 mph. But the right-hander throws it with plus sink, which allowed him to post a 1.53 groundout-to-flyout ratio in his pro career. GPE complements his fastball with a plus slider that can miss bats and also leads to weak contact on the ground. He is capable of commanding both pitches well and is smart on the mound.Because of the lack of velocity and no real third pitch, GPE likely profiles best as a ground ball-inducing reliever, but he had success as a starter prior to 2017, so he could still get a shot at helping out GPE in the back end of the rotation if needed.",0
"The D-backs weren't able to land GSP out of high school in the 2011 Draft after taking him in the 33rd round, and the lefty went on to GPE PERSON and joined the ORGANIZATION as a 10th-rounder a year later. When the opportunity arose to bring GSP into the fold at the ORGANIZATION in 2014, the D-backs didn't miss a second time, getting the southpaw as part of the ORGANIZATION deal with PERSON. GSP blossomed with the D-backs and earned his first taste of the Majors in 2017, only to be traded for the second time in his career during the offseason when he was shipped to the ORGANIZATION in a three-team trade with the ORGANIZATION. GSP pitched across two levels, reaching Triple-A in 2016 while leading the organization in strikeouts and finishing second in ORGANIZATION, though he struggled to repeat those results in 2017, both in Triple-A and the ORGANIZATION. He has had success with a solid, if unspectacular, three-pitch mix, commanding all pitches fairly well. His fastball is above-average, thrown in the 90-95 mph range, and he's shown the ability to reach back for more when he needs it. His curveball has developed into a plus pitch and he has good feel for his changeup. When he's on his game, he executes his gameplan better than most.There could be more in the tank for GSP, an encouraging sign for a guy who already is on the cusp of a big league job. His 150- and 147 2/3-inning seasons in 2016-17 are a pretty good predictor of what kind of workhorse starter he is going to be in the big leagues.",1

He's been compared to a young PERSON Ramirez.The 6-foot-1, 175-pound middle infielder is known for his strong and athletic body. He has a good arm with soft hands and playable range on defense. He can make the routine plays and the occasional extraordinary play. PERSON is also considered a strong runner.What's more, PERSON is considered an offensive-minded player who shows good bat speed and features a slight uppercut swing. He makes lots of hard contact during batting practice and has the ability to show the power in games. There's the belief that PERSON could be better suited for third base or a corner outfield position, but he'll likely get every opportunity to show that he can stay in the middle of the diamond on defense as he develops.PERSON is trained by PERSON in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"The ORGANIZATION emphasize athleticism when they look for catchers, so PERSON was an obvious target for them in the 2017 Draft. He started at shortstop as a ORGANIZATION freshman before shifting behind the plate for his final two years before GPE selected him in the third round. After hitting 11 homers in his first two college seasons, he hit 12 in his third and then 19 in high Class A during his first full year as a pro.PERSON displayed some wiry strength but used more of a controlled approach at ORGANIZATION before turning his right-handed swing loose in pro ball. He aggressively looks to drive the ball now and does to all fields, though he'll need to make some adjustments after striking out at a 32 percent clip in 2018. He spent this offseason working to learn which bat path will give him the best production.PERSON has solid speed and is faster than most catchers, which will remain true even if he slows down due to the rigors of catching. He's agile and quick behind the plate, though he's still polishing his receiving and throwing because he's relatively new to the position. Extremely versatile, he spent time at second and third base last season.",0
"If ever there were an athletic contest in which players from across multiple leagues had to compete against one another in all of their respective sports, PERSON would be a top five pick. An athletic deity in high school, PERSON was a star in every sport. He was an <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaSwX9pJsI0' target='_blank'>acrobatic dunker</a> and a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8qRgoGQX2M' target='_blank'>dominant open-field runner</a>, who was signed away from a football commitment to GPE for $1.8 million. For much of his pro career, PERSON has either been hurt or underperformed. Aside from his .270/.350/.480 season in 2017, he has struggled to make contact, especially in 2018, when he struck out in 37% of his plate appearances, and a minor league leading 215 times. Despite this, PERSON nearly posted yet another 20/20 season and improved so much as a defensive player that he's now considered plus in center. The PERSON sent him to the ORGANIZATION with a desire to see some kind of bat-to-ball improvement. PERSON responded by ditching his leg kick. His strikeout rate in GPE was 25% -- better than the summer, but still not great -- and he hit for almost no power there. His issues with strikeouts weren't, in our opinion, caused by excessive movement in his swing but rather by things like breaking ball recognition, bat path, and hand-eye coordination. Those aren't things that can be remedied by mechanical changes, and we'd rather an athlete like this be moving a lot at the plate to help ensure he's getting to as much of that power as possible, even if it means living with a lot of strikeouts. There's a wide range of outcomes possible for a talent like this, ranging from PERSON to PERSON to B.J. PERSON to PERSON to PERSON. PERSON is a premium athlete with good makeup who should get plenty of opportunity to cure his own ills at the big league level. We think he's likely to be frustrating, but reasonably valuable, and possibly have some star-level seasons in his late twenties.",0
"A converted outfielder, PERSON was up to 100 during extended and has mostly been sitting in the mid-90s with movement. He'll flash an occasionally nasty slider but it's not consistent right now, nor is his strike-throwing, but of course he hasn't been pitching for all that long. He's a 2020 40-man add and will have to developpretty quickly to merit a 40-man spot next winter, but PERSON has had success developing pitching lately and this guy has big ceiling if things click which, based on his build and athleticism, they might.",0

"In the four-prospect package obtained from the ORGANIZATION for PERSON at the 2016 Winter Meetings, the FACILITY Sox not only landed the consensus top prospect in baseball at the time (ORGANIZATION), but also a guy on the short list of the best pitching prospects (GPE). Signed for $1.5 million as the 33rd overall choice in the 2014 Draft, he dominated upper-level hitters in his first two years in GPE's system and made his big league debut this August, allowing a total of just one run in his first three starts. But after his fourth, he was diagnosed with a torn ulnar collateral ligament that will necessitate PERSON surgery and sideline him until 2020.GPE throws as hard and is as difficult to hit as any starter in the ORGANIZATION, which has prompted comparisons to PERSON. His fastball, which sits at 96-99 mph, repeatedly hits triple digits with late run that keeps it off barrels. Hitters who try to sit on his heater get embarrassed by his upper-80s slider, which features two-plane break and is a plus-plus offering at its best.GPE just needs some refinement before he's ready to pitch at the front of a big league rotation. He'll flash a plus changeup with sink, though it's inconsistent and often more of a fringy offering. He walked 4.5 batters per nine innings through his first four years as a pro and has had control problems this season when he gets too quick with his lower half in his delivery, though he's often able to power his way out of self-created jams.",1
"It's taken Altherr a little while to sharpen his considerable raw tools for consistent on-field performance, but things started to click with a move up to the ORGANIZATION State League in 2013. He has the ability to do just about everything on the field. He's capable of making good, consistent contact and he's continued to grow into his raw power, though he still needs to refine his approach and cut down on his strikeouts. He runs very well and should be able to steal some bases and cover ground in the outfield. Alther might end up in a corner spot full-time, but he should hit enough to profile well there. He still has a very high ceiling.",1
"PERSON was a well-known prospect in high school due to his bloodlines (father PERSON and older brother ORGANIZATION 1st rounder PERSON Jr.), his big tools (plus raw power) and his loud, max effort swing. Many teams didn't take him seriously as a top-2 round prospect, partly souring after his brother busted with a similar swing, but PERSON has rare bat and body control along with good enough pitch selection to make his approach work, something his older brother did not. PERSON is playing shortstop now and likely will not at higher levels, with second base the most likely fit, but he has the tools to play any corner position and his bat profiles anywhere.",1
"  PERSON was picked 14th overall by the Brewers in 2010, but when he was diagnosed with Type 1 GPE, he headed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE Diego to learn how to pitch with the disease. It's now under control, and PERSON was once again a legitimate Draft prospect in 2013. He can run his fastball up to 94 mph, sitting in the 90-91 mph zone with some heavy life. His power curveball is a solid average offering with the potential of being an out pitch, his changeup gives him a third usable weapon and he even has a slider to boot. He goes right after hitters and is especially effective when he can keep his fastball down in the zone. PERSON didn't breeze through the college ranks, but he has the tools to be a middle-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"PERSON had an up-and-down career at ORGANIZATION because of injuries, missing most of 2014 with an elbow injury then sitting out for close to a month with a broken left hand in 2016. The ORGANIZATION liked his top-of-the-order potential enough to take a chance on the redshirt junior in the eighth round, and he's gotten off to a solid start to his pro career.PERSON has solid tools, led by his above-average speed. He is a basestealing threat, and should become more of one as he learns the craft. PERSON's wheels help him defensively in center field as well, and he could stay there, though he sees time in all three spots. He has good on-base skills and is working on things like bunting to further take advantage of his speed. The ORGANIZATION have been very happy with PERSON's work ethic and makeup. They aren't ruling out him developing into a big league regular, but a career as a fourth outfielder might be a bit more realistic.",0
"PERSON passed on an opportunity to turn pro as the ORGANIZATION' 33rd-round pick in 2013 and instead honored his commitment to GPE, where he enjoyed a breakout campaign as a sophomore and then continued to star during the summer for the GPE collegiate national team. As a result, PERSON ranked as the ORGANIZATION's top position prospect entering 2016 based on his combination of hitting and athletic ability, and he backed up that title by hitting 15 homers with 44 steals as a junior. The ORGANIZATION made him the fifth-overall pick in June, gave him $4,125,000 -- the largest bonus in club history -- and then an aggressive assignment to the ORGANIZATION State League for his pro debut.With a quick left-handed bat and a knack for making hard contact, PERSON projects to hit for both power and average from the left side of the plate. There's 20-homer potential in his bat, perhaps even more if he can become more comfortable driving the ball the other way. PERSON did a better job of managing the strike zone last spring and then during his pro debut, but he still struggles at times to recognize spin, resulting in some swing-and-miss tendencies. PERSON's plus speed makes him a consistent threat on the basepaths and also serves him well in center field, where he spent his entire pro debut after manning right field exclusively at ORGANIZATION suffered a torn meniscus in his left knee during instructional league and underwent subsequent surgery in October, which delayed the start to his 2017 campaign. Though he's struggled this season back in the ORGANIZATION State League, PERSON's combination of power and speed could help him to jump on the fast track to the big leagues once everything clicks.",0
"The ORGANIZATION were pleasantly surprised that PERSON, considered to be perhaps the best pure defender in the entire 2014 PERSON, was still around when they picked in the third round. He didn't disappoint with the glove during his pro debut and even surprised some with his work at the plate. PERSON takes great pride in his defense and loves to play shortstop, a position he will undoubtedly be able to man long-term. He has above-average range, plus hands and instincts and a solid and accurate arm. PERSON' bat is well behind the defense, but the ORGANIZATION were encouraged with some of the glimpses he's shown, both in the ORGANIZATION League a year ago and in 2015 with solid contact and on-base skills. It was thought PERSON would be more a project in terms of developing his offensive game, and while he'll always be defensive-minded, there's hope there might be more there than initially met the eye.",0
"Signed by the ORGANIZATION out of GPE in June 2012, GPE has checked all the necessary boxes during his climb through the ORGANIZATION despite little fanfare. That's been especially true in 2017, with the right-hander excelling in Double-A early in the season to receive a promotion to Triple-A, where he's served as one of the ORGANIZATION's most consistent hurlers.GPE lacks a plus pitch but knows how to get the most out of his three-pitch mix. He'll operate at 92-94 mph with his fastball, imparting sinking action that nets him plenty of ground-ball outs, and he does a good job of keeping hitters off balance with his slider and splitter, both of which grade as at least average.Plus control is GPE' greatest strength, as he's consistently around the zone with his entire arsenal and seldom issues walks. That allows his stuff to play up, and it gives him a chance to serve as a back-end starter in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON was regarded as one of the top prospects in GPE when PERSON signed him in 2008. Now, after slow but steady progress through the ORGANIZATION, he is close to realizing that potential and helping the Indians in the Majors.Defense has always been the strongest part of PERSON's game. His arm, glovework, range and ability to make plays while coming in all make him an above-average defender at third base.At the plate, PERSON isn't quite as advanced, but he has made strides recently. His hand-eye coordination makes him difficult to strike out, even though he is something of a free-swinger. PERSON has a good feel for hitting, and he makes good use of his solid raw power.",1
"PERSON ORGANIZATION (PERSON, GPE) is known as ""Quarterback High"" after producing PERSON winners PERSON and PERSON and college stars PERSON and PERSON. ORGANIZATION played QB there but knew his future was brighter in baseball, so he signed for $1,327,600 as a 2013 second-rounder with the ORGANIZATION, who have drafted a long list of passers that includes PERSON, PERSON Holliday, PERSON and ORGANIZATION. ORGANIZATION experienced adversity for the first time in 2016, batting .242/.325/.399 with 161 strikeouts in Double-A, but has recovered to post the best numbers of his career this year.ORGANIZATION was learning a new position and had to endure a season-long road trip because of ballpark construction problems in GSP, but his previously smooth left-handed stroke also got loopier and more uphill. He did make adjustments and improved in the second half, learning that he doesn't need to sell out for power because the natural loft in his swing will take care of that for him. There are mixed opinions about his ability to handle quality pitching, though he does have some feel for hitting and some patience to draw walks.He has the hands and arm and enough athleticism to be at least an average third baseman, but footwork issues have contributed to his 100 errors in 368 games at the hot corner during his first four pro seasons. With PERSON entrenched at third in GPE, the ORGANIZATION had ORGANIZATION divide his time equally between first and third base last year. They also introduced him to second base this season and are pleased with the initial results there.",1
"There are lots of different ways to frame arguments about GPE. On the one hand, he's a switch-hitting middle infielder who has made lots of contact -- GPE is a .285 career hitter -- over six pro seasons. On the other, he has been hurt a lot -- shoulder surgery, most recently -- and may be painted into too small a defensive corner to be rosterable if he doesn't hit enough to be a regular. It's important to be mindful of prospect fatigue creeping in here, as GPE really broke out during the summer of 2014 when as a teenager, he hit a combined .323 in the ORGANIZATION and PERSON. He was sent to GPE as part of the three-way, PERSON Gregorius-headlined trade that offseason, had a bad 2015 in the ORGANIZATION, bounced back in 2016, and has basically been hurt since. 
Because of GPE's size and lack of power, he has to keep making high-end rates of contact to profile as an everyday player. If he lacks sufficient arm strength for shortstop coming out of the shoulder surgery, it puts even more pressure on the hit tool, because a bench role is less feasible for someone without defensive versatility.",1
" A two-way standout in high school, PERSON only wanted to hit at the next level, and the ORGANIZATION were more than happy to oblige. PERSON's best tool is his plus raw power, and he tapped into it enough during his pro debut to set an ORGANIZATION record for home runs. He takes a good amount of walks, but he also strikes out a great deal and will have to cut down on the swing and miss to consistently hit as he moves up the ladder. A pitcher who hit the mid-90s in high school, PERSON has a plus arm at third, but whether he'll be able to stay there long-term defensively remains to be seen.",1
"It's often said that the jump to Double-A is what separates a prospect, and seeing a player duplicate success once out of the hitting-friendly GPE League and in the much more pitching favorable LOCATION is a very good sign. If that's the case, then the D-backs have a very good prospect on their hands here in GPE handled the jump more than capably. He was named to the ORGANIZATION and the LOCATION All-Star Team, was tabbed as the organization's ORGANIZATION of the Year and made his big league debut. PERSON's hit tool keeps improving and he's cut his strikeout rate three years in a row. He has strength and power to come as he continues to refine his approach. PERSON has excellent speed which plays on both sides of the ball, and he hasn't lost any of it as he's gotten stronger. He covers a ton of ground and continues to get better on his reads and routes in center, while also having the plus arm teams covet for right field.PERSON is as tooled out as any offensive player in the D-backs' system, and he seems to be figuring out how to use those tools on a consistent basis, giving him the chance to be a big league regular.",1
"GPE's professional debut was delayed until 2013 because of a broken wrist that kept him out almost all of '12 and required surgery to repair. Once he got back on the field, he showed the same kind of power that the ORGANIZATION expected.GPE has an incredible amount of raw power, but how much of it he's able to utilize remains to be seen. There's a lot of swing-and-miss in his game, and he'll need to improve his pitch-recognition skills to make more contact.GPE is a capable left fielder, but his defense doesn't add much to his value. It'll be up to his powerful bat to carry him to the ORGANIZATION.",0
" If you wanted to build a prototype of what a big, strong, projectable pitching prospect should look like, starting with PERSON might not be a bad idea. The ORGANIZATION had aggressively stockpiled young arms via the Draft in recent years. Some of them were used as trading chips, but PERSON remains, and for good reason. His pure stuff is outstanding, with a plus fastball and an outstanding curve to give him as good a one-two punch as any pitching prospect. His changeup projects to be at least an average offering. He throws downhill and there's room for him to add some strength.

"GPE tops this year's list of college performers, homering more than he has struck out and posting an OPS up around 1.000.

"The son of former ORGANIZATION defensive lineman PERSON, PERSON also has a football build that has prompted physical comparisons to seven-time All-Star PERSON. He opened last summer as the consensus top high school pitching prospect before getting passed by fellow GPE product PERSON. PERSON has passed them both among PERSON prepsters this spring, and while PERSON won't be the first prep arm selected, he still could fit somewhere in the back half of the first round.PERSON usually pitches at 92-96 mph with his fastball and can reach 98, showing hard sink on occasion and generally commanding it well. There are times when his heater gets hit harder than expected, usually when it straightens out and he leaves it up in the zone. His shoulder opens early at times, giving batters a good look at his fastball, but he's athletic enough to adjust his delivery and hide the ball better.PERSON generates power with a quick arm and little effort, something that's also evident when he snaps off a wipeout slider in the mid-80s. It needs more consistency, as does a changeup that should become at least average, but he has all the makings of a quality three-pitch repertoire. He's part of a loaded ORGANIZATION recruiting class that also includes PERSON.",0

"Over the years, PERSON has been a veritable factory producing right-handers who really know how to pitch and compete without premium stuff. In 2015, PERSON went in the second round to the ORGANIZATION. Two years later, the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the third round. This year, it's PERSON's turn and he's hoping to join his predecessors in the top three rounds. The 6-foot-3 right-hander has been a solid college performer, with a highlight being throwing PERSON's fifth no-hittter in history in late March. As a freshman, he was touching 94 mph with his fastball, but hasn't gotten back there since, typically sitting in the 89-92 mph range. Early this season, PERSON used a plus changeup with tremendous success and showed a below-average breaking ball. Over the course of the spring, his curve has bounced back and flashes above-average, but his changeup has regressed. He's a strike-thrower, but not quite with the precision PERSON or PERSON showed during their days anchoring the Titans rotation. PERSON missed a good chunk of his sophomore season with elbow inflammation and has not pitched over the summer in either of the past two years. He's shown no ill effects this year, though, and a team that believes he could have two above-average secondary offerings to go along with his feel for pitching could snag him early as a back-end starter type who could move quickly.",0
"PERSON, who was named Mr. Baseball in the state of GPE in 2010, had a solid college career at the ORGANIZATION of GPE. The ORGANIZATION drafted him in the 13th round in 2013, and he spent his first full professional season with PERSON. PERSON moved up to Class A Advanced ORGANIZATION in 2015 and emerged as a ORGANIZATION State PERSON, before an even more productive second half at ORGANIZATION Jacksonville.PERSON is an aggressive hitter with a short swing that helps him make consistent contact and limits his swing-and-miss. He has average speed and showed more pop during his time in the LOCATION, where he tallied five home runs in 44 games after failing to homer in 45 games at ORGANIZATION. More power could be on the way, too, as PERSON is likely to continue to add strength to his wiry frame.Though PERSON was a second baseman in college and played mostly third base to begin his pro career, the ORGANIZATION gave him a chance to play shortstop full time last season, and they were pleased with his progress. However, because the athleticism, hands and arm strength are all clean fits across the infield, many scouts believe he may end up in a utility role.",0
"The ORGANIZATION aren't afraid to buck the industry consensus in the GPE, and they did so by spending the 25th overall pick in the 2013 GPE and a $1,866,500 bonus to land PERSON. He won ORGANIZATION honors in the Rookie-level PERSON in his debut, then shook off a rough first month in low Class A and a thumb injury to finish second in the short-season LOCATION batting race (.333) in 2014.An accomplished amateur hitter who was named ORGANIZATION as the 18-and-under world championships in 2012, PERSON has tremendous hand-eye coordination and understands the strike zone, allowing him to repeatedly barrel balls. He's more of a pure hitter than a slugger, though he has enough bat speed to produce 15 homers per season. PERSON has just fringy speed and average athleticism, so most scouts outside the organization give him no chance to stay at shortstop. PERSON thinks he has underrated quickness and a chance to stick there. He probably profiles best as a third baseman and has the solid arm strength for the hot corner.",1
"Long one of the more intriguing position prospects in GPE's system, PERSON missed all of 2013 following PERSON surgery but returned to make his big league debut the following year. However, his chances of securing a spot in the ORGANIZATION' outfield were diminished with the club's offseason trades for PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, and he spent the entire 2015 season back in Triple-A. In January, PERSON was acquired by the Brewers after being designated for assignment by GPE.PERSON is a multitalented player with at least average tools across the board and the versatility to play all three outfield positions. His bat speed gives him power to all fields, though it's mitigated by a free-swinging approach and a propensity to chase breaking balls that also depress his batting average.PERSON is a solid runner who knows how to steal bases and with the upside of a 20-20 player. Though he fits best in right field with his strong arm, PERSON presumably will have to compete with right-handed-hitting corner outfielders PERSON, PERSON and PERSON for playing time in GPE next season.",1
" At 6-foot-5 and 205 pounds, and having cashed in on a signing bonus worth more than $3 million, the only thing left to catch up with PERSON is his age. The tall lefty out of the ORGANIZATION signed at age 16 and already has a swing worthy of a spot in the lineup. He takes the ball to all fields with a long, effortless stroke, good bat speed and solid raw power. His makeup, work ethic and aptitude for hitting also come as highly praised as his offensive prowess. Defensively, he's already made the move to first base due to a below-average arm and lack of speed, but the ORGANIZATION aren't worried because, well, the kid can hit.",1
"PERSON PERSON has produced its fair share of big league talent, though the bigger names, PERSON and PERSON, have come on the mound. PERSON, born on the island of GPE PERSON and named after ORGANIZATION great PERSON, has a chance to be the best position player (and shortstop) to come from the school since PERSON was a supplemental first-round pick of the Phillies in 2006.PERSON has had a very good spring in the GPE area to raise his profile quite a bit. He's a solid defensive shortstop with good range and a tick above-average arm. PERSON love the way he swings the bat, consistently barreling up balls, and he has very good power, especially given his size. He should grow into more over-the-fence power and his baserunning acumen will allow him to pick up extra bases when he hits the gaps. While he's just a slightly above-average runner, PERSON is very aggressive on the basepaths and likes to steal bases.PERSON like PERSON' aggressive style of play and the self-confidence he displays whenever he's on the field. He definitely had some helium as the spring unfolded, moving him up boards considerably. He's committed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE.",0
"PERSON was on the cusp of the ORGANIZATION in 2012 and earned a callup just before the All-Star break in 2013. He pitched 4 1/3 relief innings for the GPE, registering a 4.15 ERA with four hits allowed and four strikeouts. He was especially effective in the Minors, pitching to a 2.48 ERA over 29 innings. When healthy, PERSON attacks hitters with a sinker-slider combination. His fastball sits in the low-90s, and his slider generates swings and misses. While PERSON has no real weapon against left-handers, if he can improve his command, he'll continue to profile as a setup man.",0
"Evaluators look at PERSON and see a prospect with lots of options and tons of upside.Will PERSON develop into a power-hitting shortstop or will he grow into a shortstop that hits for average? Could he end up in center field?This much is certain: PERSON is big, athletic and loaded with talent. He moves well around the infield and has impressed scouts with his smooth defensive actions and strong arm. PERSON has already displayed above-average bat speed and projects to have above-average raw power in the future. He's a solid runner -- clocked in the 6.6- to 6.7-second range in the 60-yard run -- and shows good instincts on the bases.PERSON is an aggressive hitter, but like many young prospects, he is still learning how to recognize pitches and manage the strike zone. He has toyed with hitting from both sides of the plate, but he will hit solely from the right side for the team that signs him. The teenager has played in plenty of games in the GPE, primarily with PERSON's Latin ORGANIZATION for prospects.PERSON is from PERSON, GPE, and trains with PERSON. The Rays are the favorite to sign him.",0
"The ORGANIZATION targeted high-ceiling players in the 2014 Draft, and PERSON might have been the best athlete in the class. He turned down a chance to play two sports at ORGANIZATION and signed for nearly $700,000 over slot value, and then led the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION in stolen bases in his pro debut. He struggled in his introduction to full-season ball in 2015, hitting just .148 with a disconcerting strikeout rate, but he managed to right the ship once he moved down to the ORGANIZATION, only to have his season come to an end with a grisly ankle injury in July. Injuries continued to plague PERSON in 2016, when he landed on the disabled list with a broken hamate in late June just as he was heating up at the plate. PERSON's plus speed makes him a basestealing threat as well as an above-average defender, either in center field or in right, where his cannon for an arm is a clean fit. PERSON has excellent bat speed and should develop at least average power as he matures and adjusts to the pro game. He does have some length to his swing, which leads to quite a bit of swing-and-miss, but it's nothing that can't be fixed. PERSON finished fifth in the ORGANIZATION in on-base percentage in his pro debut, though his approach was challenged with the jump to the ORGANIZATION last year.If PERSON can stay healthy and everything goes as hoped with his development in the coming years, he could develop into a perennial 20/20 player who also offers considerable value with his defense.",0
"After three productive years at ORGANIZATION, where he looked very much like a future center fielder and leadoff type hitter, GPE was a ORGANIZATION B pick of the ORGANIZATION in 2016. As good as he was in college, he was tough to see as a pro, missing nearly all of the 2017 season and half of 2018 with injuries, though he did make up for some lost time with a dominant turn in the GPE ORGANIZATION after the '17 season. The ORGANIZATION, who loved his speed and defense in ORGANIZATION, loved what they did see when he was on the field and were sure to get him as part of the deal that sent PERSON to PERSON this past offseason.One question facing GPE when he entered pro ball was whether he would be physical enough at the plate. While he only got 225 at-bats in 2018, he showed the ability to drive the ball with extra-base authority, especially to his pull side. His legs and his glove are still his carrying tools and he has more than enough ability to stick in center field long term, albeit with a below-average arm. He has basestealing ability as well and should get back to wreaking more havoc when 100 percent healthy.Controlling the strike zone and getting on base are still the keys for GPE to profile as a top-of-the-order catalyst. If he can continue to impact the ball like he has at times, there's still time for him to develop into a big league regular.",1
"Back in ORGANIZATION after three seasons in GPE, PERSON has a swing and miss fastball (just over 20% swinging strike rate in the minors) and viable slider and changeup. He's 31 and could decline at any moment, but he could be a good middle reliever in the short term.",0
"PERSON popped up at the same event as PERSON late in the summer, with an even louder performance, but his swing has gotten a little stiffer and some scouts think he's a left fielder.",0
"  PERSON played so well in his first professional Spring Training that the ORGANIZATION accelerated his time table and sent him to the ORGANIZATION to make his professional debut as a 17-year-old in 2013. He's performed well in two years of GPE ball, despite being one of the youngest players in his league in both seasons.PERSON has a good left-handed swing with big raw power waiting for him to tap into in games. He's an aggressive hitter but generally does a good job of making hard contact and driving the ball to all fields. He's put on some weight since signing and is now a below-average runner, limiting him to left field. PERSON has the potential to be an offensive force and it'll be up to his bat to keep him moving toward the ORGANIZATION.",0
"A late bloomer in GPE, PERSON was nearly 18 when he signed in 2012 and commanded just a $10,000 bonus. He led the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION with a 1.07 ERA in his 2013 pro debut yet didn't really break out until four years later, when he emerged as GPE's best prospect by the end of 2017. The ORGANIZATION expected him to contribute at the big league level last year but he made just eight starts before his season ended with a lat injury.PERSON improved once he added strength and started doing a better job of using his legs in his delivery. He now operates at 92-96 mph and can hit 98 with running action on his fastball. His curveball has gotten quicker as well and now sits in the low 80s with good depth.In order to succeed as a starter in the Majors, PERSON will need to improve a changeup that stands out more for its life than its deception. He never has had any difficulty throwing strikes and has been able to avoid giving up home runs despite his extreme flyball tendencies. The ORGANIZATION praise his makeup and work ethic and believe he eventually can settle into the middle of their rotation.",1
"A supplemental second-round pick by the ORGANIZATION out of a GPE high school in 2014, PERSON spent two years in GPE ball after signing for $1 million. He posted modest numbers during five seasons in the ORGANIZATION system, with the exception of a strong 2017 in low Class A. The ORGANIZATION acquired him along with international bonus pool money when they traded PERSON to the D-backs in April.PERSON has solid raw power and speed but has yet to translate them into significant home run or stolen base totals. After making strides with his approach in 2017, he regressed last year, striking out at a career-high 28 percent rate and struggling mightily against right-handers (.209/.296/.319). He still has a quick right-handed bat and could be a 20-20 player if he figures things out at the plate.With above-average speed, PERSON runs well enough to steal bases and cover plenty of ground in the outfield. He has the tools to play center, but physical development may force him to either right or left field, the latter being where he made a third of his starts last year.",0
"In recent Drafts, the ORGANIZATION had sought out athletic college outfielders, often in the later rounds. Jared PERSON came in the fifth round of the 2015 Draft and, to a lesser extent, there was PERSON from the 2014 Draft. PERSON was the next in line, an eighth-rounder from 2016 out of ORGANIZATION State who had a terrific pro debut and then made it to Double-A in his first full season. The ORGANIZATION liked what they saw there and during his stint in the ORGANIZATION to acquire him from GPE in December's PERSON trade.PERSON has long employed an advanced approach at the plate. He walked more than he struck out in three years of college ball and has a .368 on-base percentage in his ORGANIZATION career, which has helped him to advance quickly. He makes consistent contact and has some extra-base ability. His plus speed is his standout tool and he likes to put it to good use, bunting for hits often and being aggressive on the basepaths. His speed helps him in the outfield, where he can play above-average defense in all three spots. He has the skills to play center field, but he has played in both corners as well thus far as a pro.PERSON is ready to play full-time in the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION system. If he stays with his approach, he could be big league-ready fairly soon, perhaps fitting the profile of an effective fourth outfielder.",0
"PERSON was a two-way player as a high schooler in GPE, and he went to GPE as a shortstop. He was the ORGANIZATION's starting shortstop as a freshman, but his arm became too much to ignore. PERSON had largely abandoned hitting by his sophomore year.Though PERSON has only been a full-time pitcher for a few years, he earns praise for his understanding of his craft. He throws his fastball in the mid-90s, and it has touched 98 mph. PERSON's changeup is his best offspeed pitch, and his curveball gives him a third Major League-average offering.PERSON is an excellent athlete, and he repeats his loose and easy delivery well. He fields his position as well as would be expected from a former shortstop. PERSON earns high marks for his competitiveness and his aggressiveness on the mound.",1
"PERSON had put his 50-game suspension for marijuana in 2016 behind him, making a huge impact in the big leagues in '16, both as a starter and out of the bullpen. He was going to be counted on to have a large role on the 2017 Cardinals' pitching staff but instead will spend the year rehabbing after being diagnosed with a torn UCL in his pitching elbow in February and undergoing PERSON surgery.When he's healthy, PERSON is arguable the best pitching prospect in the game, with his combination of elite stuff and missing bats all pointing to a future as a frontline starter. His fastball sits in the mid-to-upper-90s comfortably and he can reach back for more, hitting triple digits at times, something that happened consistently in relief outings. He backs that up with a nasty curve he'll throw in the upper 70s that also elicits swings and misses. PERSON actually threw his improving changeup, 88-90 mph, more frequently than his breaking ball during his time in the big leagues, with tremendous success.Command had been the only thing that had held PERSON back, with a walk rate of 4.5 per nine innings in his career, though most felt that would improve over time. The track record for ORGANIZATION surgery recovery is good, but it's going to take time for PERSON to build himself back into the star all envisioned.",1
"A broken foot delayed PERSON's professional debut until 2013, but it proved to be worth the wait. He led the GPE League in ORGANIZATION and was then promoted to short-season Vancouver, where he was named the ORGANIZATION of the LOCATION playoffs.PERSON has big raw power and can be a physical presence in the middle of the lineup. He's not just a masher, however. His quick hands help him make consistent, hard contact and he has an advanced approach at the plate.PERSON has a strong arm and despite his fringy range, has a chance to stay at third base. No matter where he plays defensively, his bat will be the main attraction.",0
" PERSON fits under the description ""Have bat, will travel"" perfectly. In this case, it's not to other organizations, but rather to a number of defensive positions. A third baseman in college, he played there, second base and a little outfield during his 2011 summer debut in the ORGANIZATION system. In 2012, he played second exclusively and he may yet end up in right field. The simple fact is if PERSON keeps hitting like he did in 2012, they're going to find a place for him in the lineup. He won the organizational batting crown and topped it in slugging percentage while showing he wasn't just a product of his ORGANIZATION location by continuing to mash when he moved up to Double-A. He has the chance to be an above-average hitter with at least average power, regardless of what position he's asked to play.",0
"GPE was a shortstop in the GPE high school ranks who was immediately moved to the outfield once he signed with the ORGANIZATION, and he has some upside on both sides of the ball. He has the chance to hit for average and power, with excellent bat speed. He gets pull-happy and needs to continue to refine his approach at the plate. If he can cut down on the swing-and-miss to his game, he has offensive potential. He saw time in all three outfield spots during his pro debut in 2012 but probably profiles best at one of the corners.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION by the ORGANIZATION in 2014, PERSON compiled a 4.63 ERA in GPE ball during his first two years as a pro. He can light up radar guns like few other pitches can, however. That captivated the ORGANIZATION enough to acquire him along with fellow right-hander PERSON when they traded PERSON to GPE in November. He was on the move again the following offseason, this time going to the ORGANIZATION with PERSON and PERSON in the ORGANIZATION blockbuster. With an extremely fast arm and without an excessive amount of effort in his delivery, PERSON can work with a 97-103 mph fastball as a starter. The downside is that he sometimes doesn't know where his heater is going, especially when he crosses into triple digits. He also throws a power slider that lacks consistency and a changeup in its nascent stages.Though PERSON's control and command require more refinement, they have improved significantly since he focused on his mechanics during extended spring training this year. That will give him a better chance of remaining a starter, and he'll be a potential closer if he winds up in the bullpen.",0
"At ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, GPE) in 2015, scouts flocked to see two-way star PERSON and barely noticed PERSON, a short right-hander working in the upper 80s during his first season as a full-time pitcher. They've teamed up in college at ORGANIZATION, where PERSON continues to draw plenty of interest as a slugger and PERSON has opened eyes as a power-armed closer. He set a school record and finished second in ORGANIZATION Division I with 17 saves as a sophomore last year, then opened 2018 with 13 straight scoreless outings.PERSON's velocity jumped in the spring of his freshman year at ORGANIZATION and he now operates at 95-97 mph and peaks at 99 with some running life. His power slider gives him a second well above-average pitch at times, arriving in the mid-80s with some depth. He even can mix in a decent changeup on occasion.Because PERSON lacks size and features effort in his delivery, he's purely a reliever. PERSON strong and durable, he has taken a step forward with his control and command this year. Intelligent and competitive on the mound, he projects as a possible setup man or closer.",0
"Some scouts are put off by PERSON's buggy whip swing but he showed great feel to hit in high school and during his first pro summer, so most think he'll be able to tap into what projects as plus raw power. PERSON had PERSON last March and didn't play in 2017. Assuming a full arm strength recovery, he projects in right field.",0
"The ORGANIZATION high school ranks have produced 13 outfielders selected in the first two rounds in the six previous Drafts this decade, and PERSON could add to that number in 2016. The GPE recruit has an intriguing power/speed combination and has improved in both departments over the last year.PERSON has made strides with his bat as well and has the potential to hit for both power and average. He has a loose, whippy left-handed swing with plenty of bat speed. Add in his plus speed, and he has the upside of a 20-20 player if everything comes together.PERSON's quickness stands out more than his instincts in center field, so he could wind up on an outfield corner. With his below-average arm, that would mean shifting to left field, though scouts who like him think he'd still provide enough offense to profile there.",0
" A few things stand out about this young outfielder from the ORGANIZATION. One is his tall, muscular and athletic frame. Another is his raw power. And a third is his throwing arm. PERSON was pushed to full-season ball in 2012 and played all year there at age 19. He showed some now power and finished third in the system in GPE. PERSON also showed a penchant for striking out without drawing many walks, and after a solid first half, he really tailed off. He played both outfield corners, and while his defensive skills may be better suited to left, his arm strength plays well from right field. If PERSON can become a better hitter, he'll be able to tap into that raw power more and fit the right-field profile even better.",0
"PERSON stood out early in his high school career and colleges that recruited him regarded him as too talented to get to campus as early as age 15. He's developed into an 80 runner with 55-grade raw power that many think will turn into a 60 down the road. He's okay at shortstop mainly because the actions and instincts aren't present, so most think he moves to center field down the road. The swing is geared for line drives and has mechanical similarities to PERSON's. Most clubs regard PERSON as more of a 50 makeup guy (admittedly a subjective distinction) who has questionable enthusiasm for the game, but at some point, his near historic raw tools and strong track record are too much to pass up.",0
"As a sophomore at the ORGANIZATION of PERSON, PERSON began as a reliever, but gained confidence when given the chance to move into the rotation. He's been a weekend starter all year and while he's had some up-and-down results, he's far outperformed fellow Draft prospect PERSON has missed a ton of bats this spring, while walking very few, thanks to a solid four-pitch mix. He'll throw his fastball up to 94 mph consistently, complementing it with a pair of breaking balls. His slider will show flashes of being above-average and he'll fold in a fringy curve as well. His changeup continues to develop and could eventually be average when all is said and done. While he has a high strikeout rate, he's also been fairly hittable.PERSON is more floor than ceiling, though he does have a solid delivery and a good 6-foot-3 pitcher's frame. His upside is as a No. 4 or 5 starter, one who could come off the board in the top six rounds, which would make him the first PERSON pitcher to be taken that early since PERSON was a fourth-round pick of the Rockies in 2015.",0
"Arguing in PERSON's favor is best done using the same statisticts that have made him a Fringe Five mainstay for the last two years. He owns a 17% career walk rate and gets to every bit of his fringy raw power in games because he hits flyballs at a 54% clip, which would be the highest rate in the majors among qualified hitters. PERSON exists at the far right tail of the player population where both of these skills are concerned. He's very similar, statistically, to one-year wonder PERSON, except PERSON has better feel for contact and can actually play shortstop. He may wind up in a utility role, but PERSON is freaky enough in these ways to be more intriguing than your average bench guy, and the ORGANIZATION situation complicates the ORGANIZATION' shortstop situation enough that PERSON might be relevant pretty quickly.",0
" PERSON missed his junior season at GPE Carolina-Upstate due to a stress fracture in his back but still became the highest-drafted player in school history when the ORGANIZATION grabbed him in the fourth round of the 2014 Draft. Before his injury, PERSON had been slated to transition from the bullpen to the rotation, a move the ORGANIZATION intend to try themselves. As a reliever, he threw his fastball in the low to mid 90s, occasionally touching 96 mph. The steep downhill plane he throws from, thanks to his 6-foot-6 frame, helps compensate for his spotty command of the pitch.PERSON also throws a changeup and a solid low-80s slider with some bite, giving him a deep enough arsenal to start. To successfully make the move to the rotation, however, he'll have to do a better job of repeating his delivery and prove he's durable enough for the role.",0
" Though he didnât turn 20 until close to the end of the 2012 season, PERSON took advantage of his GPE League location and finished second in the organization in slugging, third in ORGANIZATION and fifth in homers. He is a physical specimen with a lot of tools. His power is the biggest and he can hit the ball out to all fields. Heâs a free swinger who will rack up a decent amount of strikeouts, but his power should offset it. Heâs a solid defender with an outstanding arm that fits perfectly in right field, along with his offensive profile.",1
"Already, PERSON's swing has changed. He was making lots of hard, low-lying contact at ORGANIZATION, but since signing he has added a subtle little bat wrap that has made a substantial difference in how he impacts the ball. He hit for much more power than was anticipated in the summer and fall, and the identifiable mechanical tweak is evidence that the change is real and not small-sample noise. PERSON makes routine plays at short and so long as scouts are okay with his funkny throwing motion, he has a chance to stay there. There are scouts who have him projected to second base or to center field. PERSON's previous swing enabled a bit of a jailbreak out of the batter's box, exaggerating his home-to-first speed. With the new swing, he's a 55 runner. PERSON's bat and likely up the middle defensive profile mean he's likely to be at least an average regular, and he could move quickly.",0
"PERSON had bounced back from an elbow issue in 2010 to reach the big leagues with the ORGANIZATION in 2011. But the elbow came back to haunt the right-hander, and he needed PERSON surgery in March 2012. Despite that, he was the key prospect in the deal that sent PERSON to GPE at the Deadline in 2012. PERSON suffered a setback in his rehab, requiring another elbow surgery in 2013. As a result, he still has yet to throw a competitive pitch for the GPE. When healthy, PERSON has the stuff to be one of the better pitching prospects in the game. His plus fastball sits in the mid-90s and can touch 97 mph. His power curve has the chance to be a plus pitch as well. His changeup is still a bit of a work in progress, at least relative to the other two pitches, but he was improving with it before he got hurt. His command has the chance to be at least average, though that might take some time post-surgery. He has the stuff to be a starter, but questions about his durability, as well as command struggles, may push him toward the bullpen.",1
"PERSON PERSON is the most prominent example of a Dodgers prospect throwing harder upon returning from PERSON surgery but PERSON is the latest, as he was sitting 95 or better when he finally threw pro innings in 2018. His repertoire is pretty deep but his pitch quality is inconsistent, a bi-product of two college seasons in the bullpen and time lost due to surgery. He has a cutter, curveball, and changeup and the latter two could each be above-average at peak. PERSON is stocky and his delivery has some effort. He stayed back in extended to start 2019 and is a 23-year-old with just 19 affiliated pro innings, so he belongs in a FV tier below other, similarly-aged, relief prospects.",0
"Signed out of GPE at the outset of the 2013 international period, PERSON performed well in the ORGANIZATION and GPE summer leagues during his first two pro seasons, respectively, and continued to impress the following year in the Rookie-level PERSON. Making his full-season debut in 2017, PERSON flashed an intriguing mix of tools, particularly his power-speed combo, en route to GPE League all-star honors. And while he did miss nearly two months due to a hamstring injury suffered in late June, PERSON returned fully healthy in time for the final week of the ORGANIZATION regular season.The right-handed-hitting PERSON has good bat speed with present feel for the barrel and for using the entire field, but also an aggressive approach that leads to too much swing-and-miss and will need to be toned down at more advanced levels. Adding strength to his wiry athletic frame has helped PERSON to produce more consistent power, and there could be more to come as he learns to better control the strike zone. PERSON's plus speed is his loudest tool and enables him to make an impact on the basepaths as well as in the outfield, where he's an above-average defender capable of playing all three spots, with arm strength suitable for right field. That versatility, along with his offensive potential, could make PERSON a big leaguer.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 28, 2017 - PERSON, Fla.Favorite MLB Player: PERSON in 2015, PERSON played a critical role on the way to ORGANIZATION's 6A state championship. The shortstop made numerous key plays in the field and notched three hits to lead the GPE to their third appearance in the state championship in four seasons. PERSON, who is committed to the ORGANIZATION and is labeled as a top 100 recruit in the class of 2017, is a 2015 ORGANIZATION and a 2016 ORGANIZATION First Team. PERSON is small in stature and has an open stance but he's a decent runner. He produces better from the right side of the plate.",0
"When PERSON was coming out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE in 2015, he had one of the best power bats in the entire Draft class. Since the ORGANIZATION took him 34th overall that June, he has more than lived up to that hype, hitting 58 homers over his first two full seasons of pro ball and carrying a career .508 slugging percentage into the 2018 season.Thanks to a very quick bat, PERSON can drive the ball out of the park, and for extra bases, to all fields. There will always be some swing and miss to his game, but he did cut down his strikeout rate a touch in 2017 and he does offset the whiffs by drawing a good amount of walks. He has worked on his overall approach and tried to cut down on his swing to allow him to tap into his tremendous raw power consistently. PERSON is going to have to hit because he is a below-average defender in left field with a below-average arm. The ORGANIZATION love PERSON's work ethic and that he doesn't just spend all of his time in the cage working on his one carrying tool, instead putting in great effort to show he is capable enough to play the outfield regularly. The ORGANIZATION think he'll catch what he can get to and won't be a DH only. Either way, his power bat is just about ready to contribute in GPE.",0
"ORGANIZATION was barely seen the summer before his senior year in high school, pitching in the low-to-mid-80s in the lightly-scouted southwest corner of GPE, and committed to a smaller mid-major school. In his senior spring, things starting changing; he was getting into the low-90s, but it was still raw enough and abrupt enough of a change that it made sense for ORGANIZATION to go to school, now committed to GPE. He had another velo bump early in his college career, which eventually led to PERSON surgery. PERSON grew in scouting circles as his post-surgery stuff was elite and after his first start of 2018, a heavily-scouted matchup with PERSON, ORGANIZATION looked like a top five overall pick. In that game, he hit 100 mph and flashed an above average slider and changeup along with enough feel to project as a starter. From then on, things started to unravel, until the ORGANIZATION popped the local kid 31st overall. ORGANIZATION had some minor issues -- a finger injury and fluctuating velo as weather and workload dictated -- but more worrisome to scouts were both his maturity and how he fared when his fastball was more of a 6 than an 8, and his command was a 3 or 4 instead of a 5. Most college pitchers can succeed with 55 or 60 stuff and below average command, but ORGANIZATION struggled and showed it on the mound. The optimistic case is that a change of scenery, coaching, and workload (with less pressure) will help tease out that top five overall pick version of ORGANIZATION, while the pessimistic case is that what we saw down the stretch is indicative of a future as a streaky power reliever with limited feel.",0
"Originally drafted in the 16th round by the ORGANIZATION, PERSON was a part of the package the ORGANIZATION received in the ORGANIZATION trade in 2012. PERSON was named the '13 PERSON of the Year.PERSON stands out for his fastball, which routinely reaches 98 mph. That kind of velocity, combined with the good downhill plane his 6-foot-9 frame generates, makes it very difficult to square up. PERSON's changeup is an average offering, while his slider lags behind. His command is well below average, and he will have to learn how to harness his stuff to find success in the big leagues.PERSON underwent PERSON surgery in GPE, ending his season. That, combined with his command issues, may be enough to make him a reliever again.",0
"PERSON entered 2017 as the top high school prospect in GPE and didn't look like he'd relinquish that title after twirling a pair of 18-strikeout shutouts in his first two starts. His stuff dipped later in the spring as PERSON surpassed him among PERSON prepsters, but PERSON still could get popped in the third or fourth round by a team confident that he can be signed away from a ORGANIZATION commitment. He finished his ORGANIZATION of GPE career by pitching the Warriors to their second state 2-A championship in his four years and winning PERSON's GPE player of the year award.At his best, PERSON lives in the low 90s and pops some 96s with his fastball. He commands it relatively well, in part because it often straightens out. By the end of the spring, he was working more at 88-92 mph. PERSON's curveball has its moments but lacks consistency and may not become more than an average pitch. The same is true of his changeup, which he uses sparingly. Because he's 6-foot-1 and has a long history of minor ailments, some scouts worry about his durability as a starter and wonder if he'll become a fastball-focused reliever.",0
"ORGANIZATION (GPE) spent much of this spring atop the national high school rankings (before losing in the state 6-A regional semifinals) in large part because the ORGANIZATION have a deep pitching staff with five members committed to major ORGANIZATION Division I programs. PERSON began the season regarded as a raw, hard-throwing reliever who doubled as a third baseman and one of ORGANIZATION's best hitters. He since has emerged as its most reliable starter and top prospect, surpassing PERSON King.PERSON can pitch at 93-95 mph in short stints and sits in the low 90s with his fastball as a starter. He has heavy sink on his heater and can get swings and misses with it down in the strike zone. His mid-70s curveball has passed his low-80s slider as his most reliable secondary pitch, though both have the potential to become solid offerings.PERSON has surprised with his feel for pitching, even unveiling a promising changeup with sink once he moved into the rotation. The ORGANIZATION recruit has the frame and athleticism to remain a starter, but there's some effort to his delivery and some funkiness to his arm action. Some scouts wonder if that might eventually land him in the bullpen as a pro.",0
" Thatâs right, another intriguing middle infield prospect in the GPEâ system. Unlike some of the others, though, PERSON hasnât played shortstop much in the organization, settling in as an above-average second baseman defensively. He might be undersized, but donât underestimate him. He can flat-out hit and has the chance to do what heâs done thus far in his pro career: hit  over .300. He has above-average speed that should help him steal some bases and helps him have more than enough range for second. He played alongside PERSON for the second half of the season and seeing that partnership continue should excite GPE fans.",1
"PERSON State produced a pair of Day 1 Draft picks in 2015 in PERSON and PERSON. While PERSON, whom PERSON took with the second overall pick, has already established himself as an impact big leaguer, PERSON isn't too far behind his former teammate. He signed for $750,000 as a second-round pick, finished his pro debut with PERSON and advanced to Double-A in his first full season. PERSON boosted his stock even more last year's ORGANIZATION, where he finished second in the batting race (.353) and paced the circuit in hits (30), and he spent all of 20 games back in Double-A this season before moving up to Triple-A. Considered to be the best defensive center fielder in college baseball leading up to the 2015 Draft, PERSON has carried that reputation with him to the professional ranks. His reads and jumps are outstanding and few players show more range, with some scouts grading his defensive ability as a 70 on the 20-80 scale. PERSON's below-average arm strength is his weakest tool, although it doesn't detract from his overall brilliance in center. At the plate, PERSON shows top-of-the-order potential from the left side with his knack for quality contact, strong on-base skills and speed that produces plus run times to first base and makes him a threat on the basepaths.Club officials rave about PERSON's makeup, leadership and overall feel for the game, all of which help him to get the most out of his tools. While defense alone will make PERSON a big leaguer, he could very well carve out an everyday role with continued progress at the dish.",1
"When the ORGANIZATION handed out more than $17 million in bonuses to international players during the 2014-15 signing period, most of that money went to position prospects, seven of whom received $1 million or more. PERSON generated little attention when he signed for $10,000 in December 2014 at the relatively advanced age of 18, but he's anonymous no longer now that he has developed one of the best fastballs in the system. He made a successful jump to full-season ball in 2017, winning his last 10 decisions, but made just six starts this year before requiring surgery to remove bone spurs from his shoulder.PERSON has added at least 40 pounds to his 6-foot-8 frame since signing, boosting his fastball from 90-93 mph in his pro debut to 93-97 mph with a peak of 99 last season. He carried his premium velocity throughout 2017, working at 96-99 mph in his low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION postseason start. His long arms create unusual angle and plane to his pitches, making it harder for hitters to contend with his heater.PERSON also has a curveball and changeup that show flashes of becoming plus pitches, and he has added a hard slider that also has promise. He made good progress last year with repeating his delivery and throwing strikes, no easy task for such a tall pitcher. He has clean mechanics, and if he can maintain his arm slot and take a direct line to the plate on a consistent basis, he could be a frontline starter.",0
"It's hard to know when things will click for a pitching prospect. PERSON bounced around to three different colleges and was a reliever at ORGANIZATION when the PERSON took him in the seventh round of the 2015 Draft. He had a lackluster debut that summer, but then a light went off in 2016. PERSON dominated in the LOCATION, and then held his own in three starts in Double-A, finishing the year in the top three in the organization in a host of pitching categories. He made it up to Triple-A in 2017 before requiring PERSON surgery in June.The PERSON felt PERSON hadn't been allowed to just go out and pitch and learn from failure during his college career. So they let him do just that and his four-pitch mix was more than up to the task. Sure, the velocity would play up out of the pen, but he would pitch at 93-94 mph and reach back for 96-97 whenever he needed it as a starter. He currently has two distinct breaking balls and both flash at least above-average at times. One night, the slider will be a plus pitch and the curve is just average; the next start it will be flipped, and PERSON goes with the pitch he has a better feel for. His changeup is a solid average pitch, with room for improvement. His command took a large step forward as well.Before the injury, PERSON had been strong and durable and looked every bit a starting pitcher. Once healthy, he'll get back to showing he can continue to do that at the upper levels.",0
"Originally signed by the ORGANIZATION, PERSON joined the ORGANIZATION via the PERSON trade in 2014. After a year as a starter with his new organization, PERSON moved to the bullpen in '16 and saw his stuff and results take off. His progress was delayed at the start of 2017 due to biceps tendinitis, but he joined the Double-A Reading bullpen at the end of May.The ORGANIZATION struggled with the decision to move PERSON because he did have four usable pitches as a starter. PERSON embraced the move to the bullpen and it showed. His fastball jumped to the mid-90s and touched more when he needed it. PERSON needed some convincing to focus on his slider instead of throwing both breaking balls, but he did it and it's now a swing-and-miss pitch for him, a big reason why he missed so many more bats in '16. He doesn't use his changeup as much now, but it does give him a weapon against left-handed hitters. He's always been a strike-thrower and that continued in his new role.The ORGANIZATION have developed some big relief arms internally over the last couple of years, including PERSON and last year, PERSON. They think PERSON might be next in line as a power reliever who will help out the back end of the bullpen soon.",1
" When the ORGANIZATION decided to roll the dice in the 2012 Draft by taking PERSON, the ORGANIZATION may have been the biggest beneficiaries. They were able to select the toolsy PERSON, who many thought was going to GPE. All the ORGANIZATION high school product did was win PERSON MVP honors in his pro debut, leading the rookie-level circuit in a host of offensive categories, including batting average, total bases and ORGANIZATION. PERSON can flat-out hit, with good bat speed and a better idea of what heâs doing at the plate than most hitters his age. Thereâs definitely extra-base pop in his bat now and he could develop decent home run power down the road. An above-average runner, heâll be more of a basestealing threat as he learns those skills. He has a plus arm in the outfield and has the chance to be a top-notch defender in the future.",1
" PERSON was a member of the 18-and-under national team that won the World Cup in GPE last September. He played well in the tournament, tying for the team lead with nine ORGANIZATION, and continued his strong play through the spring. PERSON is a solid defender behind the plate. His arm is slightly above average, and he is a steady receiver. Offensively, he has an advanced approach and a balanced, level swing. He creates good bat speed and projects to have at least average power.PERSON's father, PERSON, pitched for two seasons in the ORGANIZATION and spent several years as a coach in the ORGANIZATION organization. J.J., a GPE recruit, has clearly benefited from his father's instruction, and scouts praise his makeup and feel for the game.",0
"PERSON wasn't able to turn a big Cape PERSON season in the summer of 2016 into his junior year at ORGANIZATION, resulting in him sliding to the fourth round of the 2017 Draft. When he hit .320 with an .877 OPS in his pro debut, reaching full-season ball, it looked like the ORGANIZATION had a steal on their hands. He wasn't able to build off the very strong foundation of that pro debut in 2018 when he blew out his right ACL six games into the season.Once again healthy, PERSON can get back to being the on-base machine who can wreak havoc on the basepaths. It remains to be seen if the injury will have any toll on his well above-average speed, but the ORGANIZATION don't expect any regression and he was running without hesitation this spring. That should allow him to steal bases and continue to cover a ton of ground in center field, with great instincts, reads and routes as well. PERSON knows who he is as a hitter, sending line drives to all fields from the left side of the plate, working counts and getting on base, albeit without much power.The outfielder shouldn't have any restrictions going forward following his knee injury, though he'll have to show no ill effects, given how important his legs are to his game. If there are no setbacks, he should be able to return to climbing the organizational ladder quickly.",0
"It's amazing what growth and maturity can do for a young player. PERSON looked like a finesse lefty when he started out his pro career. The ORGANIZATION's stuff was much better during his 2012 full-season debut, with a tailing fastball that should be above-average. His breaking ball is still a bit inconsistent, but it shows occasional sharp bite and his changeup has improved some as well. He's lean and lanky with some deception to his delivery. He generally throws strikes and if he can keep developing on this path, he has a future as a big league starter.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"PERSON was part of one of the best high school pitching staffs of all time with #67 on this list ORGANIZATION and FACILITY RHP PERSON. PERSON went 6th overall in 2012 and had PERSON surgery within a year, then was traded to GPE as the headliner in the ORGANIZATION deal. PERSON has flashed signs of brilliance since his return but a gnarly blister limited most of his 2017 and some scouts still question his command, wondering if he fits better in short stints. No one questions his knockout curveball, which gets grades as high as a 70 from scouts on the 20-80 scale. His fastball sits 90-94 and hits 97 mph while his changeup is above average and he has a good chance to open 2017 in the ORGANIZATION rotation alongside #31 on this list ORGANIZATION.",1
"PERSON doesn't have the traditional markers to go this high: medium frame, average tools, backward K/BB ratio. That said, he's a plus makeup guy who many scouts think can go behind the plate akin to some recent Dodgers multi-positional catchers, he gets the most out of his swing with a progressive, power-based approach, he's been super productive, and he's young for his class. It's probably a 50 or 55 PV at his peak, but PERSON is the versatile intagibles-heavy type who winning teams have on the roster.",1
"PERSON is the type of player who's viewed differently by scouts and statistical analysts. Evaluators see a tweener with a small frame and no tool that projects better than average, while the numbers show that he has been PERSON's best hitter the last two years and has contributed in every phase of the game. His consistent production should get him drafted in the first five rounds.PERSON employs a simple, compact left-handed swing and has good feel for the barrel. He can drive the ball from gap to gap and is willing to work counts and draw walks. He has average speed, runs the bases well and can steal one on occasion.A three-year starter for the ORGANIZATION, PERSON played right field in his first two seasons before moving to center this spring. While he doesn't have the typical quickness of a center fielder, he has good instincts and makes plays. He'll get a chance to stick there in pro ball, with his fringy arm likely making left field his fallback position.",0
"An excellent example of why it's important to scout frames/builds, PERSON's physical tools were all 40s and 45s when he signed. But as his body has matured, those tools have all improved, and done so without PERSON losing mobility because his broad, square-shouldered frame had plenty of room for this new mass. At times he still appears to be uncoordinated, still growing into his body, but PERSON is still just the age of some older, draft-eligible high school seniors and he's already having statistical success at Low-A. He's become a sleeper platoon/low-end regular prospect, at least.",0
"The ORGANIZATION used both of their first-round picks on up-the-middle preps in 2013, selecting PERSON with the ninth overall pick and then nabbing ORGANIZATION, a gifted defensive catcher out of GPE, at ORGANIZATION. 14. Three years later, he was in his first season at the Double-A level when the ORGANIZATION packaged him with PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in a ORGANIZATION deal. A left oblique injury sidelined ORGANIZATION during the first half in 2017, but ORGANIZATION performed well back in Double-A after making a healthy return in July and made up for lost time that offseason playing in the ORGANIZATION Winter League. And even though he underwhelmed with his production in 2018 at Triple-A, ORGANIZATION still earned his first big league callup in September and made the most of his opportunity, hitting .290 with a pair of homers and three doubles in 14 games. PERSON will always be the driving force behind ORGANIZATION's game. He's an excellent blocker and receiver, who's been praised for his game-calling and feel for managing a pitching staff at every stop in his career. His arm strength is above-average but plays up because he's technically sound, he has a quick release and consistently delivers accurate throws. He has some natural hitting ability from the left side of the plate, with a level, line-drive-producing swing and knowledge of the zone. The majority of ORGANIZATION's hits are singles, though he can run into one here and there, and occasionally he'll go on an uncharacteristic power-hitting streak. While it's unlikely that ORGANIZATION will ever hit enough to achieve an everyday role in the big leagues, he has the type of profile teams covet in a defensive-minded backup.",1
"Initially signed by the ORGANIZATION for $22,500 out of the ORGANIZATION at the end of the 2013-14 international signing period, PERSON was traded to the ORGANIZATION along with right-hander PERSON for PERSON in November 2016. Thirteen months later, GPE shipped him along with PERSON and shortstop ORGANIZATION to the PERSON for PERSON. PERSON pitched in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON during his first season with his third organization but also saw his control and command regress significantly.With a quick arm and little effort, PERSON sits at 95-98 mph with the ability to reach triple digits in the late innings. He has thrown as hard as 103 mph but his velocity is more impressive than his fastball command, and the latter will dictate how quickly he moves up the ladder. He also can miss bats with his power slider and a changeup that's improving as he uses it more.He's similar to fellow PERSON power righties PERSON and PERSON, though scouts are less optimistic about PERSON's ability to harness his stuff. His walk rate jumped from 2.4 per nine innings in 2017 to 6.0 last year. Whether he can develop control, command and consistency will determine whether he becomes a frontline starter or winds up in the bullpen.",0
"Of the three third basemen selected in the first two rounds of the 2012 Draft by the LOCATION, just one has stuck at the hot corner. PERSON has moved to right field and first base, and PERSON has shifted behind the plate, with only Wisdom remaining at third base.Wisdom's tools fit the position profile well, starting with his well above-average arm strength and plus raw power. The question is whether he'll hit enough to reach his promise. He has some holes in his right-handed swing, gets pull-happy at times and struggles to recognize breaking pitches, though he made some progress in Double-A in 2015.Wisdom needs to become more consistent defensively as well. He has soft hands and good agility to go with his cannon arm, but he he makes more errors than he should.",0
"After four fruitless pro seasons as an outfielder, PERSON moved to the mound in 2018. He spent most of his 2018 season in GPE -- first in extended spring training, then the ORGANIZATION, then Instructional League -- throwing really hard (94-97, up to 100) and flashing the occasional above-average slider. Without context, PERSON is raw for a 21-year-old but perhaps someone so new to pitching with this kind of arm strength and fledgling feel for spin has potential for growth. PERSON is Rule 5 eligible next year.",0
"Though PERSON went No. 3 overall to the Rockies in the 2013 Draft, it was PERSON who opened that college season as GPE's ace -- and was regarded as the better prospect of the two. PERSON wound up straining his forearm, but he pitched through the injury with reduced stuff. The A's took him in the second round, and when they discovered that he would need PERSON surgery, they were able to sign PERSON for $400,000.When healthy, PERSON can show three plus pitches. PERSON deals in the low 90s, and he can hit 95 mph with a fastball that gains deception and life from his crossfire delivery. PERSON can make batters look bad with his slider, and he can also get swings and misses with his changeup.PERSON has plenty of polish, too, and he's also mentally tough. PERSON returned to the mound in late June, and he could prove to be a steal for GPE.",0
"A big lefty out of GPE Atlantic taken in the fourth round of the 2014 Draft, PERSON absolutely dominated the ORGANIZATION during his first full season of pro ball, leading the ORGANIZATION organization in wins, ORGANIZATION and batting average against, while finishing second in strikeouts to top prospect PERSON Reyes.While PERSON's stuff doesn't jump off the page, he does have two above-average pitches at his disposal. His 90-92 mph fastball plays up because of its life. He gets many swings and misses off of his changeup, his best pitch, maintaining his arm speed very well while throwing it. The ORGANIZATION call his breaking ball a curve, but it's more of a 78-80 mph slurve, which can be an effective third pitch. PERSON throws all of his pitches for strikes, working both sides of the plate effectively and mixing his pitches well.PERSON's upside is somewhat limited to that of a No. 4 or 5 starter, but he seems a safe bet to reach that ceiling. With his advanced pitchability, he could start moving through the system a bit more quickly.",0
"GPE, a junior college in GPE, has had a top-notch baseball program for years, helping produce big leaguers like PERSON and, currently, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON. GPE, who transferred from the ORGANIZATION of GPE after his freshman year, has the chance to follow in their footsteps.GPE has a four-pitch mix that he knows how to use effectively. He'll throw both a two- and four-seam fastball, with the former sitting in the 89-91 mph range and the latter touching 94-95 mph at times. While his curveball was his best secondary pitch at the start of his spring, his slider and changeup have improved and perhaps surpassed the curve at this point. He is capable of throwing all of his pitches for strikes.There have been some concerns about his durability and some think he might end up in a bullpen. Though he is just six feet tall, there are teams that think he has the chance to be a back-end starter at the highest level. PERSON was taken in the fourth round out of GPE a year ago and GPE has the chance to do just as well.",0
" PERSON has been an integral part of GPE's offense for three years. This spring, he led the ORGANIZATION in hitting and slugging during the regular season.  PERSON has good bat speed, and when he's timed up, he produces lots of hard contact. But his swing has a tendency to get long, and there will likely always be some swing-and-miss in his game.  PERSON was an outfielder before moving to third base this season. He has handled the position switch better than expected, and he could get a chance to stay at third as a professional. If he returns to the outfield, he profiles best in a corner and can play center in a pinch.",0
"PERSON got $125,000 in the 2018 12th round. He's very tall, long, and is athletic for his size, and he has great changeup feel. He has below-average fastball velocity, but it plays up a few ticks because of extension, and PERSON doesn't often make crushable mistakes. His slider is okay when it's located, but the changeup is PERSON' best swing and miss option against hitters of either handedness. He has sixth starter stuff on the surface, but there's a chance that 6 or better command develops late (PERSON is already 23) because of PERSON' size. If that happens, he'll pitch in the back of a rotation.",0
"PERSON entered the spring as a college performer primed to do well on GPE day, but an uneven junior season that saw him briefly lose his spot as the Friday night starter put his stock in question. He righted the ship a bit near the end of the spring, giving him a bit of an up arrow as the GPE approached.A three-year starter for GPE, PERSON has long concerned scouts with his low three-quarters arm slot. He was throwing from a higher slot in the fall and sinking the ball better while throwing his slider with more depth. Back down lower this spring, the fear was that plus his workload was wearing on him. He can still crank his fastball up to 94 mph and his slider will show good break and tilt at times. He will flash an average changeup as well.With a big, physical body that could add strength, PERSON generally stays around the strike zone. A team that feels some rest and adjusted mechanics is all he needs could find a steal by taking advantage of his up-and-down spring.",0
" The ORGANIZATION high school product got to stay in his own backyard when the A's signed him in the fourth round of the 2012 Draft. He played very well during his summer debut in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION, showing an exciting combination of hitting and on-base skills to go along with his best present tool, his speed. Considering he split his focus among two sports in high school â he was a football star as well â his feel for the game is encouraging. He uses his speed well both on the basepaths and to play center field, where he projects to be an above-average defender. The high school infielders from this Draft class, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, might get most of the attention, but PERSON might be the leadoff hitter they all drive in a few years down the road.",0
"A power-throwing right-hander, PERSON is a product of GPE, whose Mormon mission kept him from coming out for the Draft until he was 23 years old. Since being a 20th-round pick in 2013, though, he's moved rather quickly through the D-backs system.PERSON has a three-pitch mix, relying mostly on his fastball and breaking ball. He'll throw his fastball in the mid-90s with a lot of sink, which has helped him generate a ton of groundball outs. He does miss bats both with the fastball and a curve which can be a true hammer of a power breaking ball. He doesn't have great command, but he's around the strike zone enough for a life in short relief, something that is clearly in his future after starting a few games in 2014.The undersized right-hander may not be a closer at the highest level, though he has served in that role in 2015 at times. But he is starting to show that he might be able to help out a big-league bullpen in a setup role.",0
"A huge-framed, corner outfield power projection bat. Below-average athlete at present but perhaps has not fully grown into his body. PERSON early-career ball/strike recognition. ",0
"PERSON used the first of its two first-round picks in the 2012 Draft to select PERSON. After an injury-plagued first full professional season, he has bounced back in '14.PERSON's offensive upside is considerable. He has a quick swing, and he has used a more disciplined approach this season, helping him cut down on his strikeouts and increase his walks. PERSON has good raw power, and he has shown he can tap into it as a professional.PERSON is a work in progress behind the plate. He earns praise for his work ethic, giving him a chance to improve his defensive skills with more repetitions. PERSON still has a long way to go defensively, and his bat may eventually force a change of position to speed up his timeline.",0
"The ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON 28th overall in 2013, taking him nine picks after they selected PERSON lefty PERSON. The ORGANIZATION prep product dazzled during his first full season at ORGANIZATION A Peoria and then built on that success in 2015 at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Palm Beach, where he was leading the ORGANIZATION State League in ERA when PERSON dealt him to GPE for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION. PERSON logged just two starts with his new organization before landing on the disabled list with a sore lower back, and he's already landed on the shelf twice in 2016 during his time with Double-A Akron. Though he's always been a steady performer, PERSON's stuff has been on the decline since the start of 2015. His fastball sits at 86-92 mph with decent arm-side run and sink, and he shows feel for adding and subtracting with the pitch. His plus curveball isn't as sharp as it once was but it still represents the left-hander's best pitch, thrown with 12-to-6 shape and downer action. However, the southpaw dialed back its usage last season as he lost feel for the pitch, and it in turn caused him to rely too heavily on his changeup and below-average slider.PERSON's advanced command allows him to throw strikes with his entire repertoire, and he compensates for his lack of height by creating some downhill plan from a high three-quarters release point. Although the Indians love his competitiveness and high baseball IQ on the mound, they want him to throw his curveball more often moving forward.",0
"Just in case you thought the ORGANIZATION didn't have enough young outfielders in their system, there's PERSON, who has the chance to fit the right-field profile to a T if he can refine his approach at the plate.PERSON has always been young for his level and was added to the ORGANIZATION' 40-man roster after a productive year in Double-A in 2014 at age 21. He has some bat speed and terrific raw power, with the ability to hit the ball out of any park, but he'll swing at just about everything. He has a cannon for an arm that has allowed him to rack up 39 outfield assists over the past two seasons. An average runner at best, he covers enough ground to play a solid right field defensively.While PERSON is running out of levels in the ORGANIZATION' system, the outfield youth and depth in the organization should afford him the time to work on his plate discipline so he can fully tap into his offensive tools.",0
"GPE is always enticing to teams and scouts and that's exactly what GPE brings to the table. The 6-foot-2 outfielder has an easy, majestic swing with well-above-average power and the ability to hit to all fields.Defensively, GPE has a chance to play center field, but he could wind up outgrowing that position and moving to a corner outfield spot. If that's the case, he still projects to be an average defender with an above-average arm in the future. GPE could lose a bit of his speed as he grows and fills out his frame, but he has strong natural instincts that would help compensate in the field.Alexis Quiroz of the ORGANIZATION in GPE represents GPE, who is expected to sign with the Brewers.",0
" After getting an over-slot deal from the ORGANIZATION to keep him from heading to GPE, PERSON spent parts of two summers in the ORGANIZATION League honing his craft. His move to full-season ball in 2012 was a success as he swung the bat well and was a member of the LOCATION champion PERSON. Big and strong, PERSON doesnât get cheated at the plate, taking aggressive swings regularly. That leads to some swings and misses, and he needs to get better at making adjustments, but he does make hard contact and has some definite power. He moves decently enough behind the plate, especially considering his size, but heâs slow in getting the ball down to second and he needs work to stay behind the dish long-term. If he has to move, though, he might have the bat that could work well at a corner position.",0
"Had a breakout junior year and hit for much more power while doubling his walk total. Good frame, athletic swinger, explosive hands. An interesting, small-school sleeper.",0
"Ranked No. 3 on MLB.com's Top 200 ORGANIZATION, PERSON's combination of size and stuff made him a legitimate candidate to become the first high school right-hander to go No. 1 overall. Instead, it was the Marlins who nabbed him with the second selection, and they gave him $6 million to sign.PERSON had the best fastball in the 2014 First-Year Player Draft class, consistently topping 100 mph during his senior year of high school in GPE. He throws a pair of breaking balls, a 12-to-6 curve and a sharp slider, with the latter having more upside, even though he started throwing it more recently. PERSON hasn't needed a changeup, but he's shown some feel for it, and it could be an average pitch in the future.For PERSON to reach his potential as a top-of-the-rotation starter, he will have to refine his control and command. If it catches up to his electric stuff, PERSON hitters could be in serious trouble.",0
"When PERSON inexplicably fell to the bottom of the first round of the 2016 Draft, the Cardinals were more than happy to be the beneficiaries, signing the ORGANIZATION State standout to a slightly above pick value bonus of $2 million. He rewarded their faith in him by going straight to Double-A for his full-season debut, earning both PERSON All-Star and Pitcher of the Year honors while getting a late bump up to Triple-A.While some worried about his delivery and arm action pointing to a future in the bullpen, the Cardinals love PERSON's durability and pitchability. His fastball will sit in the mid-90s and he can touch 97 mph, throwing the heater with heavy sink to get a ton of groundball outs. His slider has cutter-like action and is a plus pitch and he's separated out a curve that he showed strides with during his first full season. His changeup should give him a fourth at least PERSON average offering.PERSON can still stand to refine his overall command and despite the good stuff, he didn't miss many bats, though the Cardinals aren't worried about that and feel his stuff will play as a starter. They do know that his fastball-slider combination will also play well in a bullpen if there's a need in GPE.",1
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 14, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON was named to the 2015 Perfect Game Underclass 2nd Team and the 2016 Underclass 1st Team. He was also awarded a position in the 2016 ORGANIZATION, an event that has become one of the more prestigious in all of amateur baseball.PERSON was a member of the 2014 15U ORGANIZATION Team that went 9-1 and finished runner-up to GPE in the 15U World Cup. He went 2-for-5 with a double, four ORGANIZATION and a stolen base on offense, while posting a 2.21 ERA over 11 2/3 innings across three appearances (two starts) on the mound, allowing five hits and five walks while striking out 13. At the plate, PERSON shows below-average power potential, but has shown solid ability on the mound, and he profiles as a pitching prospect.",0
" The ORGANIZATION went above pick value to sign PERSON and his three-pitch mix away from GPE State. A good athlete who was a two-way player as an amateur, PERSON repeats his delivery well and should have excellent command of all three of his pitches. He can reach back for a little extra on his fastball to hit 92-93 mph. His curve should be an above-average offering, and he has a very good feel for a deceptive changeup. PERSON used all of his offerings in a solid pro debut in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION in 2012. With his advanced feel for pitching, he could be ready for a challenge in 2013.",0
"He doesn't have jaw-dropping physical tools but PERSON has a well-rounded offensive skillset, a long track record of above-average offensive performance while being young for his level and he plays a competent shortstop. PERSON' frame is maxed out and he's not likely to grow into much more power without better incorporating his lower half into his swing, but he'll hit plenty of doubles and reach base at an above-average clip. Even with PERSON's departure, the shortstop picture in GPE is crowded by PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and, some would say, PERSON. It's worth noting that PERSON got his first in-game reps at second base last year. He'll likely debut in 2018 and his bat will play at second base or shortstop.",1
"GPE is a potential quick-moving relief prospect who returned from a hamstring injury in mid-July 2019. He throws really hard and his fastball has bat-missing movement, and it pairs well with his hard knuckle curveball. He could be a late-summer relief piece for GPE.
",0
"The younger brother of PERSON outfielder PERSON, GPE is more advanced and more physical than his sibling at the same stage of their careers. A 31st-round pick out of a GPE high school by the Twins in 2015, he has the tools to go in the first round three years later. To join PERSON (1996) and PERSON (2017) as the only ORGANIZATION position players ever to go that high, he'll have to shake off a down summer in the ORGANIZATION that left scouts questioning his ability to hit with wood bats as well as his effort.A switch-hitter, PERSON shows aptitude and power from both sides of the plate. He has the ability to hit for a high average with 15 or more homers per year, though his Cape struggles were a surprise after he batted .361/.464/.541 during a breakout sophomore season with the ORGANIZATION. He has logged similar numbers as a junior, displaying a quick bat, good strength and a patient approach.Though PERSON has solid-to-plus speed, he's not always that fast out of the batter's box and is still learning to get the most out of his quickness on the bases and in the outfield. He played mostly right field in his first two years at ORGANIZATION before seeing more action in left field this spring, and he needs to improve his reads and routes. His arm is fringy at best, making him better suited for left field than right.",0
"PERSON hasn't let the fact that he came from GPE, with no high school baseball team, get in the way of working his way up the ORGANIZATION organizational ladder. The 2011 first-round pick reached Double-A in 2014, at age 21, putting him way ahead of the curve.PERSON's advanced approach at the plate belies his years and his experience. He is extremely patient at the plate, as his career .387 on-base percentage heading into 2015 would attest, and he cut down his strikeout rate quite a bit in 2014, showing an ability to hit to all fields. PERSON has gotten bigger and stronger as he's matured and his power has started to show up a bit more consistently. He's a solid runner with good instincts and his defense has improved in center field, as has his arm. He may have seemed like a long-term project when he was drafted, but PERSON isn't too far off from helping out in GPE's outfield. An ability to play all three spots won't hurt his chances of getting that first callup.",1
"Depending on the look, some scouts think he can play center field, others think he'll get bigger and shift to right field, but everyone sees a hit tool and power projection.",0
"One of the most projectable pitchers in the ORGANIZATION system, PERSON carried 170 pounds on his 6-foot-4 frame when he signed out of the ORGANIZATION for $250,000 in 2012. His combination of stuff and feel for pitching gives him a chance to blossom into a No. 3 starter.PERSON has added velocity since signing and now works with a 90-93 mph fastball that should continue to get stronger. He shows the aptitude for spinning a curveball that will be a solid pitch once it adds more velocity, and his changeup has similar upside.PERSON throws strikes and keeps the ball down in the zone with ease, thanks to a stress-free delivery that he repeats well. He's advanced enough to handle a jump to full-season ball at age 19, though PERSON will continue to handle him carefully while he adds strength to his slender build.",0
"PERSON could be the next ORGANIZATION of GPE left-hander to become an All-Star, following in the footsteps of PERSON and PERSON. He has a ceiling as a No. 2 or 3 starter if he can improve his changeup and command, and if not, he has enough pure stuff to be a closer. The 2013 second-rounder was sent to GSP, along with fellow pitching prospect Zach Eflin, for PERSON in December.PERSON's best pitch is his nasty slider, which reaches the mid 80s. He can drop it in on the hands of left-handers or on the back foot of right-handers. After working at 90 mph to 94 mph with his fastball during his junior season with the ORGANIZATION, PERSON pitched more at 88 mph to 92 mph in his pro debut. Lengthening his stride during instructional league helped him reclaim that lost velocity.PERSON's delivery looks a little stiff, and it features some recoil, leading some scouts to question whether he can develop the third pitch and control to remain in the rotation. PERSON is starting to throw his changeup more often, and it has made some progress.",0
"PERSON had back issues in college and scouts weren't enamored with his conditioning, but he had premium velocity, a plus slider and he performed at against ORGANIZATION hitters. He somewhat surprisingly fell to GPE's 6th overall selection in the 2016 draft. Reports were even stronger in 2017. PERSON is remarkably athletic for his size and he's more balanced throughout his delivery now than he was in college. His command has improved and now projects to average or a tick above. PERSON also rebooted a curveball he had shelved at ORGANIZATION and is flashing a plus changeup at times. He's going to have command of four above average or better pitches and rare lefty starter velocity. He has #2/3 starter ceiling and could reach GPE this year.",1
"PERSON's arm strength and slight frame stand out the most to scouts. He is best described as having a ""loose arm"" with quick arm action and a good fastball that can reach 94 mph. PERSON also pounds the strike zone with all three pitches, including a changeup and a power curveball. He works fast and has the potential to have an above-average tailing fastball.A star for the ORGANIZATION, PERSON drew a lot of attention for his aggressiveness and fearless approach on the mound during ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION in January, but some wonder how his body will hold up over the course of a long season.",0
"The son of former big league pitcher PERSON, PERSON was making the most of his first year of post-high school pitching following PERSON surgery. Pitching in controlled outings at ORGANIZATION's old stomping grounds at ORGANIZATION of LOCATION, the right-hander opened eyes all season.Working in stints of four or five innings, GPE showed the makings of a very good three-pitch mix. He was throwing his fastball in the 92-95 mph range and his curve has shown glimpses of being an above-average breaking ball. His changeup could give him a third Major League average in time. Despite having needed elbow surgery, he has a relatively easy and clean delivery. That should help him command the ball better in the future.It's easy to project more from GPE because of his delivery, his bloodlines and the further he's removed from surgery. He could be a decent bargain for a team in the top five rounds.",0
"In his first season with the ORGANIZATION after joining them via the ORGANIZATION trade, PERSON managed to throw just 78 1/3 innings because of shoulder issues. PERSON to prove his worth to the team that dealt for him, PERSON did just that in 2014, staying healthy and throwing well in Triple-A while also pitching in the ORGANIZATION in what he hopes to be his home park, PERSON Field.Coming from his huge 6-foot-9 frame, PERSON's upper-90s fastball gets on hitters in a hurry. He throws downhill, with sink, consistently, leading to groundballs when he isn't missing bats. His sharp slider adds to the strikeout rate, 10.4 per nine innings through 2014, and his changeup has improved, giving him another sinking weapon. PERSON still struggles with his command -- his walk rate jumped back up in 2014 -- largely because so much can go wrong with a delivery from a pitcher this tall. That, along with shoulder fatigue at the very end of the season, may have been the reason why the ORGANIZATION didn't bring him up last September.The 25-year-old PERSON is ready for a shot and could make a big contribution to a young rotation in 2015. If he can harness his stuff a bit more consistently, he could stick around for a long while.",0
Bins projects as a strong backup catcher that's also a solid athete.,0
"PERSON put himself on the prospect map by leading the LOCATION with nine homers and 33 walks as a Sacred Heart sophomore in 2015, only to slump in the ORGANIZATION that summer and again as a junior. He fell to the 17th round of the 2016 Draft, signed for $80,000 and didn't do much in his pro debut. But he has opened eyes since with his power and patience, combining for 30 homers and 176 walks in his first two full seasons while reaching Double-A.PERSON has quick hands and a pull-heavy approach, giving him more pop than a typical 175-pounder. He's an extreme flyball hitter who makes a lot of loud contact from the right side of the plate, though the ORGANIZATION would like to see him cut down his swing and make more regular contact. He works deep counts and draws a lot of walks, giving him healthy on-base percentages despite subpar batting averages.With solid speed and an aggressive nature, PERSON can steal an occasional base. Some club officials believe he's the best defensive infielder in the system, and his quickness and arm strength allow him to play second and third base and serve in a utility role if needed. If he can put the bat on the ball more consistently, he could be an everyday shortstop in the mold of ORGANIZATION.",0
"In his three years at FACILITY, PERSON went from a wild freshman to an all-conference closer as a sophomore to an important member of the rotation. That evolution helped him go from being a 29th-round pick (signability played a role) as a GPE-eligible sophomore in 2017 to the 43rd overall pick in 2018, when the ORGANIZATION signed the right-hander for full pick value. PERSON was suspended 50 games in December after a second positive test for a drug of abuse.PERSON' calling card is his slider, considered to be the best college breaking ball in his GPE class. It's a mid-80s breaker with a high spin rate and so much break some saw it as a power curve, and it was a pitch he leaned heavily on in college. When PERSON is starting, he typically throws his fastball in the 90-95 mph range, but he sat in the mid-90s and touched 97 when he was relieving in 2017. He flashes an average changeup with some fade, a pitch he'll need more to succeed at the next level.Whether PERSON can remain a starter will depend largely on his command, which did improve in 2018, and whether his stuff will hold up over the course of a full season in a rotation. The Cards are committed to developing him in that role, with the knowledge his fastball-slider combination does look very good in shorter stints out of the bullpen.",0
"Wire-to-wire shoulder issues kept PERSON off the field for nearly all of the 2018 regular season. He was limited to fastball/changeup-only bullpens in the spring but didn't really got going until late in the summer, when he made two starts in GPE and showed stuff that was slightly beneath where he was earlier in his career, with his fastball residing in the 92-94 range. Poised to pick up innings in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON once again had shoulder discomfort and was shut down for the year. The A's still felt compelled to add him to the 40-man this offseason rather than let another team take a $100,000 flier on him in the Rule 5 and hope his fastball/slider combination stuck in their bullpen. 
At his absolute best, PERSON will sit 93-96 with a plus slider and average-flashing changeup, a No. 4 or 5 starter if his change and command improve. Of this triumvirate of injured arms, PERSON is the most likely to be a reliever, but his injury history is the least lengthy. He was on the same bullpen schedule as PERSON early in camp but still hasn't pitched in a spring training game.",0
"After a breakout 2017, PERSON took his fastball/curveball combination to Bowling Green and made 15 mostly unremarkable starts there before tearing his ORGANIZATION. He had PERSON near the end of July. We likely won't see PERSON again until late next year, and he might end up throwing the bulk of his innings during instructs or ORGANIZATION. The time off means missed reps with a third pitch, and a greater likelihood that PERSON ends up in relief, which was already a possibility given his delivery and limited control.",0
"Since being a top 10 pick back in 2013, PERSON' pro career has been one of contradiction. On the one hand, the toolsy outfielder has had trouble staying healthy, with hamstring issues, a broken orbital bone and an oblique injury that prevented him from going to the ORGANIZATION in 2016, all keeping him off the field. At the same time, the GPE native reached Triple-A at age 21, which is well ahead of the curve.The main reason PERSON has been able to move so quickly despite the interruptions has been his advanced approach at the plate and his innate ability to hit for average regardless of time away. He has a very smooth left-handed swing, one that has largely featured a hit-first approach, though the power started to show up a bit more in 2016. He draws walks and does not strike out a ton, though he struggled a bit in Triple-A for the first time. PERSON' reads and routes in center field have improved, and he should be an outstanding defender there with an accurate, albeit slightly below-average, arm.Part of the reason rumors spread about the ORGANIZATION' willingness to trade PERSON during last offseason was because PERSON is nearly ready, though repeated hamstring issues in 2017 kept him from banging down that door.",1
"PERSON entered the spring as one of the more intriguing high school bats in the country, one who many thought had first-round potential. An up-and-down spring has made him a bit more of a polarizing prospect than that, with opinions on him varying greatly.PERSON' offensive potential is what had scouts interested in the first place, so if you saw him when he was swinging the bat well, you like him. He hasn't done that as consistently as some would have liked to see. He does show good bat speed and has definite power potential from the right side of the plate. PERSON isn't overly athletic, so even though he plays shortstop for his high school team at ORGANIZATION, he will likely have to move to third at the next level, with some thinking he has the hands and arm strength to handle the hot corner.PERSON did miss some time this spring with a quad injury, but he certainly has been seen enough over the summer and at events like the ORGANIZATION. He reminds some of PERSON in terms of body type, and he's also drawn a ORGANIZATION in high school comp. A team believing his bat will play will give the ORGANIZATION commit a shot in the opening few rounds.",1
"PERSON's father, GPE, hit .288/.397/.436 as a 10-year minor league first baseman, and may have gotten a shot had he played during an era that better appreciated his on base skills, or had he not been blocked by PERSON in '95 and PERSON in '96. PERSON is a totally different baseball entity, standing apart not just from his father but from the rest of the minors, and access to such a unique skillset is partly what motivated the curious Rays to draft him in the second round in 2018. PERSON was ORGANIZATION's two-hole hitter, starting center fielder, and closer. If forced to chose a traditional developmental path, teams would have overwhelmingly preferred PERSON on the mound, where his stuff is commensurate with a typical middle reliever. But PERSON is also a plus-running switch-hitter, with some natural lift as a right-handed hitter and good barrel control as a lefty. The Rays want to take advantage of all of PERSON's skills and asked that he be announced on draft day as a two-way player. At ORGANIZATION, PERSON would often warm up his arm in center field, sometimes very little, before coming in to pitch in save situations. In pro ball, he pitched once every seven days, would have a bullpen day at the midpoint between outings, and either DH or play CF on the other days. Developing as a two-way player is actually less labor intensive than existing as one in college, where PERSON's schedule was more variable. Neither of PERSON's individual roles projects to be one of impact. On the mound he looks like a middle reliever; with the bat he looks like a fourth outfielder. But if he performs like a standard 40-inning reliever, like PERSON, and quintessential fourth outfielder, like PERSON, he'll generate 1.5 to 2 annual WAR, combined.",0
"After losing his spot at GPE, PERSON became a walk-on at the ORGANIZATION of GPE and was forced to step right into the starting lineup as a freshman. Over his first two years, he was a glove-first backstop, but his GPE profile really jumped when his bat caught up to his defense as a junior, landing him in the third round. He was tired during his pro debut and the ORGANIZATION think they'll be getting a look at the real PERSON in 2018.PERSON built a strong defensive reputation at GPE, showing good receiving and blocking skills and an above-average arm. It looked more like average during his summer pro debut, though he still threw out just over 30 percent of potential basestealers in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League. While he was a much better hitter in his junior season, it remains to be seen how the bat will play at this level. He makes consistent contact, but didn't show much in the way of the extra-base ability that raised his profile in college. PERSON will have to show how he can stand up to the rigors of a long season, while continuing to add strength and showing he can be an all-around catcher. If not, a future backup role seems extremely feasible.",0
"Will be highest paid GPE amateur ever, with $1 million to PERSON being the number to beat. 6-4, switch-hittimg shortstop with feel to hit even though he hasn't grown fully into his body. Young for the class and still raw at the plate, with some reports of trouble vs. velocity.",0
"Entering summer showcase season, PERSON was known as something of an oddity: a switch-hitting, switch-throwing catcher who was also an ambidextrous reliever when needed. As the summer wore on, PERSON grew on scouts, was chosen as the backup catcher for PERSON, and quickly took the starting job from eventual PERSON second rounder PERSON. PERSON was able to do this (and eventually become a first round pick) due to his innate present feel for contact at the plate and receiving behind it. In addition to solid contact skills, PERSON also started to lift the ball in games closer to the draft and get to all of his fringy raw power. This polish helped to make teams less worried about his advanced age relative to his prep peers, and some scouts thought he was among the top 5-10 players in the entire draft. 
PERSON had a solid pro debut that was in line with the expectations of any of the pro scouts we talked to who watched the ORGANIZATION' ORGANIZATION club. He's an average runner and an above-average athlete for the position, projecting as an above-average defender with a 65-grade arm. Some clubs don't like the recent track record of prep catchers and considered taking PERSON and then moving him to third base, but his feel for catching is too advanced to throw away. There are some similarities to another prep catcher from the prior draft: M.J. PERSON of the ORGANIZATION. PERSON is a little twitchier while PERSON is a little more advanced in terms of skills. PERSON's mother is PERSON and he would be the first Native GPE big leaguer to debut since PERSON and the second ever from the ORGANIZATION, joining PERSON.",0
"At 6-foot-1 and 185 pounds, PERSON's mature build has drawn praise and some criticism from scouts.Evaluators like his bat - he's been called one of the most ""pure bats"" on the market - and his power in batting practice and games. PERSON also like the switch-hitter's rhythm in the batter's box and approach at the plate, although there's a belief he's a better hitter from the left side.On the other side of the ball, PERSON has displayed good hands and a strong throwing arm in front of scouts in games and tryouts, making him one of the top defensive players in the ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION) this year. He is still working on his footwork and defensive actions, but his overall game is expected to improve with more instruction. In the end, it's PERSON's athleticism and body type that sometimes come into question, but there is no denying that he's one of the top players available this year.",0
"Like his 2015 Draft classmate PERSON, PERSON pitched briefly, and in relief, during his pro debut after being taken in the second round. He spent his first full year as a starter, and outside of what the organization termed arm fatigue that shut him down for a month, he had a successful season. While PERSON passed him a bit by reaching Double-A in 2016, PERSON got to that level in 2017, though he had more difficulty sustaining that success. He still has the stuff to succeed as a starter at the highest level. PERSON did see the velocity of his fastball back up a tiny bit as a starter, though he still touched 91-92 mph. His bread and butter is his plus slider, the one offering he has that can miss bats, though he's more of a pitchability, control-type lefty. His changeup improved with the reps he got as a starter, giving him a third average offering. He throws all of them for strikes. PERSON does have bullpen experience thanks to his time at ORGANIZATION, but there's nothing that says he can't be a back-end starter at the big league level.",0
"Few players in the 2014 Draft could match GPE's combination of power and speed, but he still lasted 37 picks because he never put up big numbers in three seasons at GPE. Signed for $1,534,100, he went deep just twice in his pro debut but had 22 homers and 31 steals in his first full pro season last year. PERSON still aren't sure what to make of GPE, however. He has a pretty left-handed swing to go with considerable bat speed and raw power, giving him middle-of-the-order upside and 20-20 potential. Yet his feel for hitting isn't as impressive as his physical tools, and he swings and misses more than would be expected.GPE has well above-average speed that plays better on the bases than it does on defense. He has split his pro career between center and left field, but he's destined for the latter position because his lack of instincts negate his athleticism. His arm is his worst tool and is best suited for left field as well.",1
"It seemed like the runway was clear for ORGANIZATION to begin a pro career after graduating from FACILITY. But about a month before he walked, the ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION began once again requiring at least two years of active duty before graduates could apply to serve out their time in reserve status for the purpose of playing pro sports. Then baseball was reinstated as an Olympic sport, and ORGANIZATION found an avenue to pro ball through the World Class PERSON, a military unit focused on training for the Games in the two years leading up to competition. So ORGANIZATION, having sorted out some arcane rules about FACILITY personnel being unable to have second streams of income, is technically an FACILITY lieutenant training for the 2020 Olympics, while the ORGANIZATION pay for his development, but don't pay him.
ORGANIZATION was 89-94 throughout the 2018 Fall League, with his secondary stuff about average, flashing above (especially the change). He could be a fifth starter, but if his fastball ticks up in short relief, he'll fit in a mid-inning bullpen role. It's unclear what happens to ORGANIZATION and his military commitment after the 2020 games conclude.",0
"  The ORGANIZATION weren't able to sign 2013 first-rounder PERSON but helped to make up for that loss by going well above pick value to land PERSON. He has established himself as one of the best all-around hitters in the system with a fine 2015 campaign. PERSON has been known for his big raw power since high school, when he wowed scouts with his big home runs on the showcase circuit. He began to deliver on that pop with home runs in game action this year and has already shown he knows how to control the strike zone and use the whole field to hit.PERSON is a well-below-average runner, limiting him defensively to first base. He's a capable defender there, but the pressure will always be on him to hit. He will go as far as his bat takes him.",1
"GPE entered his high school senior season in 2012 as a potential first-round pick, but a lackluster spring and a strong commitment to PERSON dropped him all the way to the 39th round before the ORGANIZATION took him. He barely pitched in his first two years with the ORGANIZATION, redshirting in 2013 following thoracic outlet and PERSON surgeries and making just one appearance last season because of a stress fracture in his back. Finally healthy again in 2015, GPE has regained his stuff. He's pitching at 90-94 mph with his fastball, which features heavy run and sink. His 83-84 mph slider shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch.GPE pounds the strike zone, though he'll need to refine and trust his changeup to remain a starter in pro ball. He's more massive than athletic and has yet to establish any track record of durability, so he could be destined for the bullpen anyway.",0
"PERSON was primarily a shortstop during his first year of junior college and pitched just eight innings. He moved to the mound in 2014 and helped PERSON reach the ORGANIZATION II Junior College World Series, pitching his way up ORGANIZATION boards in the process. The A's selected him in the fifth round that year and he signed for $305,000. He had the best season of his pro career in 2017, finished second in the Double-A PERSON in wins (11) and fifth in GPE (3.49), then came to PERSON in January along with PERSON in exchange for PERSON and PERSON Buchter.PERSON has a quick arm and typically throws his fastball in the 92-96 mph range with good sinking action that nets him ground-ball outs and results in few home runs. He has a pair of above-average secondary offerings in a curveball, which he throws with tight spin and late bite, and a changeup, a pitch he made big strides with last season. Improved feel for repeating his delivery has led to him throwing more strikes, though he regressed with both his control and command in his first full Double-A campaign.With his athleticism, big arm and feel for three average-or-better pitches, PERSON has the ingredients to become a No. 4 or 5 starter in the big leagues.",1
"It's still unclear to us whether or not anyone knew PERSON was draft-eligible as sophomore in 2016. At the very least, he was overlooked playing on a weaker team in a lightly-scouted conference. He went undrafted, which allowed him to play for PERSON, who only found out about him from a fortuitous tip, later in the summer. PERSON was the sparkplug on the heavily-scouted team that included multiple future first round picks, and a bidding war for him amongst teams that hadn't yet spent their entire 2016 draft pool ensued toward the end of ORGANIZATION USA's run. PERSON is a plus-plus runner with good baseball instrincts and a contact-first approach at the plate. He has sneaky raw power that he may tap into with swing adjustments. Somewhat similar to PERSON, both have outcomes that range from upper-level 40-man occupant to low-end regular, but PERSON's bat is more stable and he's left-handed, so we have him ahead. He's almost a lock to hang around the big leagues for at least a few years in some role, even if it's as a fifth outfielder.",0
"GPE's top high school pitching prospect in 2013, PERSON could have gone in the top five rounds had he been signable, but he ultimately turned down the ORGANIZATION as a 28th-rounder. Now he's the ORGANIZATION of GPE's best starting pitching prospect since PERSON went sixth overall to the ORGANIZATION in 1987. He's inconsistent but can be spectacular at times, such as when he came within one out of a no-hitter against PERSON and outpitched potential No. 1 overall pick A.J. Puk in a matchup against GPE in a span of four April starts.PERSON has one of the best fastballs in the 2016 Draft. He can sit in the mid-90s and reach 100 mph as a starter, and on his worst days he operates at 92-95. PERSON's heater is even tougher to hit because it has good run and sink and he throws it on a steep downward plane.PERSON will flash a plus changeup with some fade and sink, but he hasn't demonstrated much feel for spinning a breaking ball and now works with a knuckle-curve. He has trouble repeating his mechanics and throwing quality strikes on a regular basis, and many scouts believe he'll wind up in the bullpen. He stayed healthy in 2016 but had been shut down in each of the previous three seasons, missing three months last year with a forearm strain.",0
"PERSON played mostly third base on PERSON last summer, while PERSON was at second and PERSON played shortstop. All three project as shortstops in pro ball and they may all go in the first round. PERSON is small and has toned down his swing a bit this spring to focus more on contact, but it's stilla  bit funky, relying more on his standout quickness and instincts in all phases of the game.",0
"A two-way player who had started in ORGANIZATION's weekend rotation as a sophomore, PERSON served as the ORGANIZATION' closer this past season during their march to the ORGANIZATION World Series. The ORGANIZATION, in taking him No. 19 overall in the 2014 Draft, think he might have the chance to head back into a rotation.As a starter, both at ORGANIZATION and in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON would throw his fastball in the 90-93 mph range, occasionally touching 94. In short relief, he's been up to 95-97 and has been touching 98 mph. PERSON's mid-80s slider has tilt and bite when it's good, but it can get slurvy at times. He doesn't use his changeup much, and it's the development of that third pitch, along with refined fastball command, that will determine if the athletic PERSON can start at the next level.Cincinnati has had some success turning former college relievers into starters and getting them to the big leagues, so this process is worth watching.",0
"PERSON has been traded twice: first from GPE to GPE for PERSON, then to GPE in the ORGANIZATION deal. His control regressed pretty badly in 2018 and this, combined with his addition to the 40-man, make it more likely that he ends up in a relief role. Both the quality of his breaking ball and his fastball velocity vary pretty dramatically, but when they're both dialed in, PERSON can dominate without throwing a lot of strikes, mostly by bullying hitters with his heater. He is stiff, oddly postured, and may not have the necessary athleticism to repeat his delivery. The ORGANIZATION should continue developing him as a starter so he gets more reps with both his change (which got better in 2018 and has a chance to miss bats one day) and breaking ball, but we think they'll pull the ripcord eventually and let PERSON breath fire in late innings.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION made PERSON a second-round pick in 2011, they saw him as a projectable outfielder with a big league body and the chance for plus power, speed and arm strength. But he hit just .221/.254/.275 during his first three pro seasons, prompting his move to the mound in 2014. He reached Double-A a year after making his first pro pitching appearance and claimed a spot on the 40-man roster last November.PERSON has one plus pitch in a fastball that sits at 91-94 mph and touches 97 with mild sink, and the potential for another in his slider. His low-80s breaking ball improved in his second year as a pitch and flashes good tilt. He also has made progress with his changeup but projects more as a two-pitch reliever.While PERSON always had a strong arm and drew some scouting interest as an amateur pitcher, his quick transformation into a potential setup man has been surprising. He almost immediately regained his feel for pitching, showing the ability to repeat his delivery and throw strikes, though his control regressed in 2016. Once he improves his ability to locate his pitches, which got exposed a little bit when he got to Double-A, he'll be ready to help in GPE.",0
"As twitchy as catching prospects get, PERSON posts plus-plus pop times thanks to a combination of plus raw arm strength, efficient footwork and a transfer so quick it qualifies as slight of hand. He's also a promising receiver and, while physically projectable, scouts don't anticipate PERSON will get so big that he needs to abandon the position. He also has plus raw power projection and a good chance to get to much of it as a right-handed hitter, though his left-handed stroke is somewhat stiff and upright. PERSON is the best J2 catching prospect since PERSON (PERSON had more power projection and pure arm strength) and, ignoring hindsight, there's an argument that PERSON is superior because of how likely he is is to remain behind the plate (PERSON had mobility and receiving issues) and grow into a well-rounded, impact defender.",1
"Like ORGANIZATION Whitley two years ago, PERSON is a PERSON prep right-hander who will land in the first round after improving his physical conditioning and seeing his stuff and stock take a significant step forward. He led ORGANIZATION (Nacogdoches) to the PERSON state 3-A title as a two-way star in 2017, then consistently worked in the low 90s on the showcase circuit. This spring, he repeatedly has topped out at 97 or 98 mph.PERSON's fastball sits at 92-94 mph with heavy life that should turn wood bats into kindling. He has an array of promising secondary pitches, with most scouts preferring his low-80s slider to his mid-70s curveball, though the latter has nice shape. He hasn't had much need for a changeup but shows the potential to have an average one.PERSON is a decent athlete who uses a controlled delivery that allows him to provide strikes on a regular basis. His 6-foot-5 frame and high-three-quarters slot create steep downhill plane with his pitches. His emergence this spring makes it unlikely he'll follow through on a commitment to PERSON A&M.",0
"PERSON won't be able to match the GPE status of his uncle PERSON, the ORGANIZATION. 2 overall pick and the ORGANIZATION winner in 1982 who's currently the head coach at ORGANIZATION III Carthage (Wis.). Nevertheless, he's a top prospect in his own right and has a chance to become the highest-drafted PERSON position player since the ORGANIZATION popped PERSON in the second round 31 years ago. The second-best high school shortstop available, trailing only PERSON's PERSON, PERSON was generating first-round buzz as the GPE approached.Because he grew up around his uncle's program, PERSON has advanced instincts in all phases of the game. His tools are catching up, as he has improved his strength, swing, speed and arm in the last year. He has worked to eliminate a hitch in his left-handed stroke, which has enough bat speed and leverage to produce 15 homers per year.After previously seeming destined for second base, PERSON now should be able to remain at shortstop. His arm strength and speed are at least solid -- some evaluators grade them as pluses -- and he has reliable hands. He's committed to PERSON but figures to get drafted too early to make it to GPE.",0
"Scouts have praised PERSON's athleticism and they like his projectable body. In the batter's box, PERSON has gained a reputation for making good contact, especially in the inner half of the plate. Like most prospects his age, PERSON still needs to improve on his hitting mechanics and approach at the plate. He's expected to be able to drive the ball to all fields once he improves on the minor flaws in his batting technique.On defense, PERSON has shown decent footwork and good hands. He has the range to make the routine plays and his overall skill set on defense is expected to improve once he is placed into an academy and receives more instruction. He has also shown a strong arm.PERSON has displayed the ability to use his skill set in games. The ORGANIZATION teen racked up five hits and scored four runs in three games during PERSON's ORGANIZATION in February. He also walked twice.PERSON is trained by his father, PERSON.",0
"Thought not especially projectable, PERSON has loose, quick wrists as well as natural feel for contact. He loads his hands low, allowing his bat to mirror that path of pitches and lift them in the air. He has some of the best natural hitting ability in the class and, as a corner outfield prospect without huge power projection, it will have to carry him.",0
"A college reliever taken in the 15th round doesn't bring much in the way of expectations with him to the pro game. PERSON, however, using decent stuff and plenty of deception from the left side, has many thinking he'll be able to help out the big league bullpen someday. The ORGANIZATION product will throw four pitches, all average and sometimes a tick above, for strikes. He'll use different arm angles to give hitters very different looks, making it tough to pick up the baseball. PERSON will pitch with an average fastball that will touch 92-93 mph on occasion, an average slider and a curve that will be better than average at times. He can even turn his changeup over against right-handed hitters. He'll drop down to sidearm, making it even tougher to have a comfortable at-bat against him. PERSON made his full-season debut in 2015 in the hitter-friendly GPE League and was closing games for GPE Empire before earning a promotion and doing the same thing in Double-A. He profiles more as a middle or set-up man at the highest level.",1
"PERSON, a former GPE ORGANIZATION star, spent his first full professional season with PERSON. Though he remains somewhat raw, his big arm and prototypical starter's build entice scouts. Having made it up to Double-A in 2015, he clearly intrigued the ORGANIZATION, who got him from the Nationals in return for PERSON just prior to the non-waiver Trading Deadline.There's still some projection left for PERSON, and he could end up pitching with a tick more velocity than he has now. His fastball typically sits in the low 90s, occasionally reaching 96 mph. His secondary stuff is still inconsistent, but he has the makings of a solid curveball and changeup. He's still learning to consistently repeat his delivery, but at his best he fills up the strike zone with all his pitches. PERSON is far from a finished product, but he has the upside to develop into a Major League starter in time.",1
"ORGANIZATION is the son of former big league reliever PERSON and has been a known prospect of interest since his sophomore year of high school. Though he's not built like most prep prospects, ORGANIZATION is remarkably athletic and a dynamite high school basketball player. His stuff has waxed and waned this spring, but when it's good, ORGANIZATION has arguably the best present three-pitch mix and pitch usage in the class. He's a short-strider, so the fastball is going to play down a bit due to poor extension, but otherwise he projects as a mid-rotation arm due to the quality of his secondaries, and is, potentially, a quick-moving one. He's in play as early as pick #7, then there seems to be a gap before his name starts coming up again in the late teens and early twenties. ",0
"  PERSON was the best position player prospect on the ORGANIZATION' Gulf Coast League team that went 49-9 in 2013. The GPE native moved up to Class A Hagerstown in 2014 and earned a spot on the LOCATION postseason All-Star team. He missed most of the first three months of the 2015 season after breaking a finger on a slide during the opening week. PERSON's speed is his best tool and he uses it well on the bases and in the outfield. He stole 69 bases in 2014, the second most in full-season ball. But he doesn't just run indiscriminately. He has good instincts on the bases and will bunt for a hit. Defensively, he takes good routes and tracks down an impressive amount of fly balls in center field. While PERSON's speed and defense give him two plus tools, he'll have to prove himself offensively as he advances in the ORGANIZATION. He has some on-base skills and has a good approach at the plate, albeit without much power.",1
" During college, PERSON was used primarily as a reliever, but both at ORGANIZATION and in two summers in the ORGANIZATION. After drafting him in 2012, the ORGANIZATION gave him a chance to start, but they scrapped that plan in 2013. His fastball plays up out of the bullpen and has touched the upper-90s. More typically, PERSON throws in the low- to mid-90s and mixes his fastball with a hard curveball. He throws from a good downhill angle and gets lots of groundballs as a result. Dating back to college, however, PERSON has suffered from control problems, stemming from his extreme overhand arm action and unorthodox delivery. If he can improve his command, PERSON would fit well into the back of a Major League bullpen.",0
"A senior sign in the 15th round out of ORGANIZATION, PERSON jumped on the prospect map during his first full season in 2014 and continued to impress with a move to Double-A in 2015. He capped it off with a very strong performance in the ORGANIZATION, but did not keep the momentum going, struggling in 2016 back in Double-A.Since joining the organization, PERSON has developed into a much more viable offensive threat. He came out of the college ranks with a very bad and choppy swing, almost with a downhill swing path. He's worked since to get some usable length to his swing to allow him drive the ball through the middle of the diamond, rather than just chop at it and use his legs to get on. He'll never be a big power guy, but he should be able to drive the ball to the gaps. He runs well and is a basestealing threat and offers excellent range in the outfield. He's always taken pride in his defense and can play all three spots.PERSON missed time in 2015 with a thumb injury, but made up for it with his outstanding ORGANIZATION turn. There was hope he could use that to springboard to the top of the system, but he'll have to get past his 2016 struggles first in order to reach his ceiling of a valuable fourth-outfielder type.",0
"GPE high schools have spawned a number of talented left-handers in the last 15 years. PERSON was a first-round pick as a prepster; PERSON got first-round money at the same stage; and PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, ORGANIZATION and PERSON all became first-rounders or supplemental first-rounders after three years of college. PERSON has reached the big leagues and PERSON will be an early-round choice next year after emerging as PERSON's best starter as a freshman this spring.The latest in the line of ORGANIZATION State southpaws is PERSON, who may be unsignable but could blossom into another first-rounder after three years at ORGANIZATION. One of the more projectable lefties in the entire Draft, he already can reach 94 mph with his fastball and could park in the mid-90s once he fills out his skinny 6-foot-5 frame. He has some shape but lacks power with his curveball, which also could be helped with more physical development.PERSON has some fade to his changeup but needs to do a better job of selling it to hitters. He uses his height and high three-quarters arm slot to create steep downhill plane and has a feel for throwing strikes. Though he still needs a lot of polish, he could be enticing as early as the third round if a team thinks it can divert him from the ORGANIZATION.",0
"GSP was moved to the bullpen in 2018 but a lot of teams think he has the repertoire depth and command to start, assuming he retains the same quality stuff for multiple innings. The sizable strikeout totals GSP has posted come from his ability to locate his slider and changeup rather than from high-quality stuff, and he'd likely max out as a fifth starter if re-introduced to the rotation.",0
"After logging 39 innings as a true freshman in 2016, PERSON garnered Mid-American Conference pitcher of the year honors as both as sophomore and junior, going a combined 15-3 in 30 starts with 251 strikeouts in 170 2/3 innings between the two years. The ORGANIZATION selected PERSON in the eighth round of the 2018 Draft, signed him for $169,600 and watched him continue to dominate in his pro debut. PERSON's first full season brought similar results, as he made just six starts at ORGANIZATION A Lansing before moving up to ORGANIZATION A Advanced Dunedin.PERSON's effectiveness is routed in his invisible fastball. He throws his heater with below-average velocity, usually working at 88-92 mph, and sometimes works in the lower side of that velocity band. But the pitch plays above its velo because he's incredibly deceptive, employing long arm action on the backside and an explosive delivery that enables him to induce a ton of whiffs inside the zone. He also demonstrates feel for throwing both a mid-70s curveball and a harder slider, with the latter projection as the better secondary pitch, and he'll also mix in a changeup. PERSON doesn't fit into a neat box as a right-hander who lacks physical projection, pitches with below-average velocity and lacks a put-away secondary pitch, but there's something to be said for the effectiveness of his fastball and the sustained success he's had as a result. Whether he's able to navigate Double- and Triple-A lineups should offer more insight into whether PERSON can stick as a starter, but the early returns are encouraging.",0
"PERSON whetted scouts' appetites when he threw in the mid-90s during fall practice in 2016, but he became academically ineligible and missed his entire sophomore season at FACILITY A&M-Corpus Christi. He built up more anticipation with a brief summer stint in the ORGANIZATION and another strong fall last year, then created all kinds of buzz by touching 98 mph and fanning a combined 27 in his second and third starts this spring. He hasn't been that dominant on a consistent basis, but he'll still easily surpass PERSON (ninth round, 2012) as the highest-drafted player in GPE history.PERSON has a lightning-quick arm that delivers 92-98 mph fastballs with sink, and he maintains his velocity into the late innings. He also has three secondary pitches that grade as plus at their best. His mid-80s slider is probably the most reliable, though some scouts prefer his tumbling changeup and his low-80s curveball features depth.Despite his quality stuff, PERSON gets hit harder than he should. He's not particularly tall and has an uphill delivery, costing him plane on his pitches. His command also fluctuates, and his ability to locate his pitches where he wants ultimately will determine if he can make it as a starter.",0
" While PERSON has hit pretty much everywhere the ORGANIZATION have sent him since drafting him in the third round in 2010, he scuffled upon reaching Triple-A in 2015. He still made his big league debut in GPE, and a shoulder injury forced him out of action for over a month.A compact swing and quick hands allow PERSON to make consistent hard contact. He can occasionally turn on a ball and drives the gaps well, but power is not a big part of his game. He knows how to take advantage of his plus speed and can be disruptive on the basepaths. He has made significant strides on the defensive side of the ball as a professional and profiles well at second base. PERSON endears himself to scouts with his hustle and hard-nosed style of play. Though his height makes it easy to label him a grinder, his tools give him a good chance to be a solid regular in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"GPE isn't toolsy but he has good feel to hit from both sides of the plate and terrific defensive instincts in center field. He's stout and not very projectable, but already looks like a potential bench out field type who can play all three spots and let you match up late in games.",0
"PERSON' older brother ORGANIZATION signed for $1.1 million with the ORGANIZATION last year out of the same high school, ORGANIZATION went in the 3rd round to the D'Backs and, next year, ORGANIZATION is looking like a top two round caliber arm from the same school. PERSON doesn't have much projection, but has solid feel of three pitches that have all been above average at times.",0
"A junior college reliever, PERSON is a very interesting arm strength/physical projection developmental prospect. He was still just 18 on draft day and is already throwing 90-95, and his gangly 6-foot-6 frame portends more velo. He has some nascent breaking ball feel but is understandably behind fom a development standpoint due to his college role. He's a long term project but has ingredients with which to work.",0
"Selected in the sixth round of the 2012 Draft, PERSON was named the ORGANIZATION of the Year in 2014 after he posted a .905 OPS with 153 hits, 87 runs, 17 home runs and 23 steals in 130 games between Class A Quad Cities and Class A Advanced Lancaster. He began 2015 back in the GPE, where he hit .320 with 15 home runs in 66 games, but his power dropped off considerably after moving up to Double-A. In GPE, the ORGANIZATION traded PERSON to PERSON in the ORGANIZATION Gomez/Mike Fiers deal, and he spent two weeks on the shelf in late August with an irritated nerve in his thumb.PERSON has a short, compact swing from the left side that produces hard contact across the whole field, though he does have a tendency to get pull happy. He won't hit as many home runs as he moves up the organizational ladder, but the bat and approach are good enough for him to offer average power at maturity. PERSON' above-average defense and cannon arm are fits in either center or right field, and he split time between both positions in 2015. Though he'll have a chance to remain up the middle, some scouts think he's better suited for right field long-term. Though he's struggled this year in his return to the Double-A level, PERSON' above-average speed gives him an intriguing blend of power, speed and hitting ability, the combination of which could make him a dynamic top-of-the-order hitter.",1
"Every team in the big leagues would like a player like PERSON in their Minor League system.PERSON has a good build for a shortstop, and he has the defensive actions that will allow him to stay at there -- at least at the beginning of his professional career. Some scouts project that his body will force him to move from shortstop to third base, but there's also chance he stays at his original position. PERSON is a strong teenager. He has plus raw power and plus arm strength, and he's shown the ability to hit in games. It's his hit tool that has some scouts thinking that PERSON will be a middle-of-the-order type of player. Overall, he presents an interesting package of tools to scouts, but many evaluators want to see him display those talents more consistently. Other scouts believe he is the best all-around player in the class. PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION for $4 million.",0
"PERSON had PERSON surgery as a freshman at ORGANIZATION, returning as a redshirt freshman in 2016 and pitching out of the bullpen. He pitched largely in relief in 2017, mixing in a few starts, and was drafted in the 35th round by the ORGANIZATION. But PERSON opted to return to PERSON to pitch in the rotation for his junior season. He threw well enough to land in the fifth round of the 2018 Draft and while he didn't pitch much in his first summer, he did reach full-season ball, though he was too fatigued to throw at instructs.Big and strong, PERSON has an interesting three-pitch mix to work with, starting with a fastball that touched the mid-90s in his final college season, but sat more at 91-92 over the summer. It has a high spin rate and he can miss bats with it, though he also can keep it down in the zone with sink to elicit ground-ball outs. Both his slider and his changeup flash above-average at times, with his slider the more consistent of the two secondary offerings. PERSON has always been a strike-thrower, but didn't always command the ball well within the zone, leading to a higher hit rate in college than you'd expect given his stuff. That wasn't the case in his small sample size in pro ball, so the A's are intrigued to find out if he can continue that trend over 140-150 innings in a rotation.",0
"The last product from PERSON to make it to the big leagues was reliever PERSON. The last position player from the ORGANIZATION school to make it was PERSON, who last played in 1972. PERSON is hoping to follow in their footsteps.The 14th-round pick is a left-handed hitting outfielder who could profile well in center field and atop a lineup if his bat continues to develop. It has made strides since he's joined the organization, and he hit well enough in the GPE League to start the 2015 season to earn a promotion to Double-A after a 2014 campaign that was interrupted by back problems. He has no power to speak of, but he can really run, which allows him to be a base-stealing threat and cover a lot of ground in center field. He's one of the better defensive outfielders in the system.PERSON may profile best as an extra outfielder, and he has seen time in the past at all three spots, but if his ability to make contact and get on base can improve, there might be a bit more than expected to come.",0
"PERSON is one of many whiff-heavy corner bats with huge power who floats around the upper levels of the minors, putting up big power numbers while struggling to find a big league role if their parent club has someone at 1B/DH. The ORGANIZATION have tried PERSON in the outfield but scouts don't think he's playable out there. PERSON has the advantage of hitting left-handed, but unless the ORGANIZATION make a concerted effort to give him reps soon (they demoted him to Double-A to start 2019, so not a great sign) he'll probably bounce around on waivers until a team with 40-man space -- and the time to see whether or not PERSON can hit big league pitching -- gives him a chance. Sometimes this is how clubs fall into PERSON and PERSON, but it's also the fate of many a Quad-A hitter.",0
"PERSON was an early-round prospect for the 2017 before he chose to reclassify for the 2016 Draft a year ago. ORGANIZATION approved that decision, making him part of a banner high school crop in GPE. PERSON, who will turn 18 three weeks before the draft, is the state's best position prospect since PERSON went fifth overall to the Royals in 2011. A homeschooled student who takes a class and plays at ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, Kan.), PERSON offers an exciting array of tools. He has well above-average bat speed and foot speed and plus raw power and arm strength. He has committed to switch-hitting and while his natural right-handed stroke is quicker and more fluid, his lefty swing is fast and loose.PERSON already is bigger than the typical big league shortstop and lacks classic actions for the position, so he'll likely need a new defensive home in pro ball. The ORGANIZATION State recruit has the quickness for second base and the arm strength for third base, though some scouts question his hands and think he's destined for center field. He has the offensive upside to profile at any of those spots, and the work ethic to make the most of his tools.",0
"After redshirting in his first year at ORGANIZATION and working just 12 innings in his first season on the mound, PERSON led ORGANIZATION Division I by averaging 4.1 hits allowed and 15.2 strikeouts per nine innings in 2016. Since signing for $275,000 as a 10th-round pick that June, he has continued to avoid bats. In two pro seasons, he has compiled a 1.16 ERA, 11.5 strikeouts per nine innings and .159 opponent average while allowing just two homers in 93 1/3 innings.With his 6-foot-7 build and those strikeout numbers, it would be easy to suspect that PERSON is a power pitcher who blows fastballs by hitters. While they don't catch up to his heater, it usually arrives at 89-93 mph. It has fringy velocity, but 80-grade deception, as his size, extension and his low arm slot combine to make it appear much quicker than its radar-gun readings.PERSON' tricky fastball is his only real weapon, so he projects as a reliever only. His changeup can be a solid pitch at times and rates better than his slider, but he'll probably need a more reliable secondary pitch to keep more advanced hitters off balance. He'll also need to throw more strikes after his walk rate jumped from 1.8 per nine innings in his pro debut to 4.2 in his first full season.",0
"PERSON and his older brother PERSON teamed to help ORGANIZATION (GPE) reach the 2017 ORGANIZATION World Series, with PERSON ranking among the national juco leaders with 19 homers and 82 RBI, before both were drafted in the 36th round. PERSON turned down the ORGANIZATION and transferred to GPE, while PERSON returned to the ORGANIZATION as the consensus top juco prospect for 2018. He has maintained that status despite elbow issues that prevented him from catching for a month and have limited his appearances on the mound, where he has been clocked as high as 100 mph.GPE has well above-average raw power to all fields and an aggressive right-handed swing that generates uncommon bat speed. He has a maximum-effort approach at the plate (and on the mound), and while he doesn't strike out excessively, his lack of patience is a cause of concern. He did show that his pop plays with wood bats and against better pitching when he finished fifth in the ORGANIZATION with six homers last summer.Scouts were skeptical of GPE's ability to stay at catcher when they saw him as a freshman, but he has improved defensively and projects as at least an adequate receiver. His arm strength is an asset behind the plate, though the ORGANIZATION commit needs to improve his throwing accuracy. Despite his impressive radar-gun readings, his violent delivery would make it difficult for him to hold up as a full-time pitcher.",0
"The top pitcher out of GPE and arguably one of the best prospects in the class overall, PERSON is a talented young player with tons of potential.First of all, he has the look scouts covet. PERSON has the prototypical pitcher's build: long and lean. He's strong and athletic with room to grow. He's aggressive on the mound and has good feel for his pitches and how to attack hitters.PERSON's best pitch is his fastball and it sits in the 93-97 mph. range. He shows good sink and movement with the pitch along with excellent command. He also throws a changeup and his slider continues to improve. PERSON trains with PERSON in GPE. The ORGANIZATION are the favorites to sign him.",0
"PERSON's power is derived from a combination of bat speed and strength, while his lofty barrel path through the zone enables him to generate backspin consistently. A right-handed hitter, he can get pull happy at times but did a better job of using the whole field in 2015. PERSON also made huge strides toning down his aggressive approach, posting a career-best walk rate in his first taste of Double-A while also reducing his strikeout rate by near five percent.PERSON's power is derived from a combination of bat speed and strength, while his lofty barrel path through the zone enables him to generate backspin consistently.

PERSON also made huge strides toning down his aggressive approach, posting a career-best walk rate in his first taste of Double-A while reducing his strikeout rate to 15.9 percent from 20.1 percent the previous year. Defensively, PERSON has the arm strength and glove to handle third base, but he lacks the range and first-step quickness, with speed that grades as well below average. He saw playing time at first base for the first time in 2015 and could move there full-time down the road, although it would place additional pressure on his offensive development.",1
"This is probably a right-hitting first baseman in the end, and PERSON's frame is not as projectable as his measureables might indicate, but he's young and already has sizeable raw. He's also shown all-fields in-game power and has surprising straightline speed for his size, a 50 runner underway.",0
"A second-round choice in consecutive Drafts, PERSON turned down the ORGANIZATION as when they didn't offer him the full $680,400 assigned value for his No. 75 slot in 2012. The highest unsigned high schooler that year, he went 30 picks higher after a year at ORGANIZATION State (Okla.) JC. He originally agreed to a $1.1 million bonus that got discounted to $915,000 after a physical revealed he had been born without a right pectoral muscle.PERSON has had no health issues and has thrown strikes with ease since turning pro. He mixes four pitches while working off a fastball that sits at 91-93 mph and touches 95 with life and command. His slider shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch but needs more consistency, as do his curveball and changeup. PERSON repeats his drop-and-drive delivery well, allowing him to pound the bottom of the strike zone. He's on his way to becoming an innings-eating No. 4 starter, perhaps more if he fills out his projectable frame and his stuff picks up.",0
"PERSON is extremely athletic with a projectable body and lots of raw talent. PERSON love his upside. In fact, some evaluators believe he has the potential to have plus tools across the board. Overall, the teenager profiles as a center fielder and he has impressed scouts with his defensive actions in the outfield and how well he covers ground. He has plenty of arm strength for the position and could probably play all three outfield positions if needed. A decent runner, PERSON has the potential to be a base-stealer. Like most prospects his age, PERSON is far from a finished product and will benefit greatly from the daily instruction he receives once he signs with a club and enters a team's academy.PERSON's recent development has been slowed by an arm injury, but he has since recovered.The teenager is trained by PERSON in GPE, PERSON.",0
"Rather than being one of the oldest prep players in the 2014 Draft class, PERSON expedited his graduation and was granted eligibility for the '13 Draft by PERSON, leading to his selection by the Nationals in the third round. The GPE native had an impressive full-season debut the following year as a teenager in the ORGANIZATION A GPE ORGANIZATION, but failed to take a step forward at ORGANIZATION A Advanced ORGANIZATION in 2015, and then had a subpar showing in the ORGANIZATION. He got back on track in 2016, though, earning All-Star honors at ORGANIZATION before moving up to Double-A at age 21. PERSON's approach has been more advanced and consistent than anticipated; he's proven to be a patient hitter who sees a lot of pitches and takes his walks, though his knack for working deep counts, on top of his natural swing-and-miss tendencies, has led to high strikeout totals to begin his career. And while raw power was his calling card as an amateur, the left-handed hitter has struggled to apply it in games as a pro.After playing shortstop in high school, PERSON was shifted to third base upon turning pro, where he shows an above-average arm. However, some scouts already doubt that he'll be able to stick at the position long term, with his stiff actions and below-average range portending an eventual move to first base.",0
"If a player can get to the big leagues on work ethic alone, PERSON should have a lengthy and successful career. Whether or not it can make up for the lack of pure stuff remains to be seen.The hardest worker in the organization, PERSON pitches without any fear and shows a willingness to pitch inside better than any other pitcher in the system, getting outs as a result. And he does it with a fringy fastball, at best, one that sits in the 87-89 mph range and can touch the low-90s. PERSON moves the pitch in and out, up and down, generating a ton of groundball outs along the way. His changeup is his best pitch, an easily above-average offering he will throw at any time. While it still needs refinement, he can throw his breaking ball for strikes. Don't look for strikeouts from PERSON, but he also rarely hurts himself with walks.Full-season ball should be a good test for PERSON to see if his pitchability and moxie can continue to get people out. He could develop into a solid No. 4 or 5 starter in the future.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON, an ORGANIZATION commit, has done nothing but hit at ORGANIZATION (Ariz.). The senior hit .330 as a sophomore and bumped it up to .404 with 24 RBIs in 34 games as a junior.With a slightly open stance and level swing, GPE sprays the ball to all fields but has trouble with offspeed pitches.GPE has a lean projectable frame and a solid glove. The middle infielder currently rates average on defense and has the tools to stay up the middle in the future.",0
"GPE's older brother PERSON went fifth overall in the 2012 Draft and reached Double-A in his first full pro season. PERSON won't go quite that high but looks like a first-rounder and also could move quickly through the ORGANIZATION. He performed well last summer, leading the GPE college national team with 11 steals and winning playoff ORGANIZATION honors in the ORGANIZATION League.GPE has a nice package of tools, with his bat standing out the most. He has a sweet left-handed stroke, and he manages the strike zone and recognizes pitches well. His body has enough strength and leverage to possibly produce plus power if he were to add some loft to his swing, though he's content to spray line drives all over the field for now.He enhances his solid speed with keen instincts, which make him an asset on the basepaths and in the outfield. He has a chance to play center field, and if not, his strong arm will fit well in right.",0
"The ORGANIZATION lost a pair of outfield prospects in the 2015 Rule 5 Draft in PERSON, whom the ORGANIZATION selected with the ORGANIZATION. 1 pick, and PERSON. Originally a ninth-round Draft pick out of GPE in 2012, PERSON was left off the ORGANIZATION' 40-man roster in spite of a breakout 2015 campaign in which he hit .321/.427/.447 with 38 extra-base hits and 23 steals across three levels, finishing the year in Triple-A.A right-handed hitter, PERSON has a short, quick swing that yields a lot of contact, and he does a good job of using the whole field. His on-base skills have improved as he's moved up the ladder, thanks to a mature approach and advanced feel for the strike zone, and he knows how to use his plus speed when he gets on.PERSON's speed also makes him a rangy defender in the outfield, and he's capable of playing all three positions. He spent the offseason playing winter ball in the ORGANIZATION, where he paced the league in total bases and ORGANIZATION and ranked second in home runs and doubles. And while PERSON has played just 29 games above the Double-A level, the ORGANIZATION see him as a capable bench outfielder for the 2016 season.",0
"PERSON and GPE Thomas More High (ORGANIZATION) left-hander PERSON were supposed to be the top two high school prospects in GPE this year, but PERSON' velocity dropped precipitously and PERSON's also declined under a heavy workload. PERSON now seems certain to attend GPE-ORGANIZATION, and PERSON could join him there if he doesn't get picked high enough to sign.After pitching at 91-95 mph on the showcase circuit last summer, PERSON has operated with an 88-91 mph fastball for much of the spring. He still reaches 94 mph on occasion, and his fastball can break bats with its running, sinking action. His projectable frame hints at more and more consistent velocity in the future if he isn't overworked.PERSON lacks a reliable second pitch. He flashes an average curveball but gets under or around it too often, and he doesn't trust his changeup. There are a lot of moving parts and effort in his delivery, creating concerns about his ability to stay healthy and command his offerings.",0
"PERSON's first full professional season saw him start the All-Star Game for the GPE League before moving up to Double-A Pensacola for the second half. After his breakout year, the ORGANIZATION traded him to the Phillies in exchange for PERSON. None of PERSON's pitches jump off the page, but he does have four of them that he can throw for strikes. His fastball can touch 93-94 mph, and his slider shows signs of being a potential above-average pitch, as well. PERSON mixes in his curve and changeup well to keep hitters guessing. All of his stuff plays up because of his unusual delivery in which his arm stays hidden, making it tough for hitters to pick up the ball.  When he was a member of the ORGANIZATION' system, PERSON was often compared to PERSON for his stuff and deception. It didn't take long for PERSON to get to the big leagues and PERSON could be on a similar track.",0
"PERSON was Draft-eligible for five straight years at an ORGANIZATION high school, PERSON (Ariz.) CC and PERSON and he distinguished himself with wood bats in summer college leagues. But he didn't get picked until his senior season of college, signing for $1,000 as a 26th-rounder in 2017. He broke out in 2019, posting some of the best offensive numbers in the ORGANIZATION system while playing six different positions. But it will now be up to the D-backs to further his development after they acquired him, PERSON, J.B. Bukauskas and PERSON from the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION deal.PERSON has made consistent contact from the left side of the plate since turning pro but is doing more damage in 2019. He's showing an ability to drive the ball for the power to the opposite field that he didn't display in the past. Though he has fringy speed, PERSON has good instincts and an aggressive nature on the bases and he can pick his spots to steal. With an average and reliable arm, he's best suited for second base and left field. He can play an adequate third base and first base as well, and he also has seen action at shortstop and right field.",0
"Could be athletic, projectable pitching prospect or contact-oriented CF.",0
"PERSON took over the closer role at the ORGANIZATION of GPE as a freshman and never let go of it. After three years, he held the career saves record for the school, which resulted in him being taken by the Mariners in the fourth round of the 2016 Draft. After a summer of saving some more games in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON was sent to the ORGANIZATION along with PERSON in return for PERSON and PERSON Simmons.The lefty reliever didn't rack up saves in his first full season, but he did pitch very effectively in the LOCATION, striking out 12.4 per nine innings and keeping hitters to a .198 batting average against. He does it with a solid two-pitch mix, really all he needs to succeed in short relief. His fastball sits in the low-90s and touches 95 mph, but it plays up because it has plus movement and comes from a low three-quarters arm slot. His sweeping slider gets swings and misses from hitters on both sides of the plate. He has less than pinpoint command, but throws enough strikes to be effective.After PERSON spent the entire season at one level, look for him to start moving a little more quickly with his two plus pitches. While he's unlikely to close again, he does have the chance to be an effective lefty setup or middle man in the future.",0
"Because of the local weather, high school baseball in GPE doesn't get underway until late May, which would have made PERSON impossible to scout were there not alternatives. PERSON ended up on a youth travel team called ORGANIZATION which played lots of weekend games at any of three facilities near PERSON and in GPE. The concentration of opposing talent in these games was sufficient enough that teams thought PERSON reinforced what they saw from him as an underclassman. He's a selective hitter with all-fields doubles power and a chance to stay in center field.

PERSON is almost 19 and already quite physically mature, each considered negatives by the scouting community, but he comes with a long track record most prep hitters do not. Opinions vary regarding PERSON's physical projection and how it might affect his power output and ultimate defensive home, but PERSON's bat is stable enough that he's one of the higher-floor high school prospects. With few college hitters in the mid-first round mix, PERSON could be considered a viable, slightly toolsier alternative to college hitting as early as pick #6.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON PhillipsSlated to play next year at ORGANIZATION (Ariz.), PERSON has a slight build with narrow shoulders and hips.Offensively, he has limited bat control and speed but still manages to produce line drives from the left side of the plate.Behind the plate, PERSON can effectively throw out would-be basestealers.",0
"It can be difficult for a high schooler from a place like ORGANIZATION to measure up to his contemporaries in places like GPE or GPE, but PERSON took some serious steps in that direction over the summer, playing for PERSON, where he had mixed results as the 18 and under squadâs leadoff hitter, while also participating in the ORGANIZATION Games and PERSON All-American Classic.Toolsy and athletic, he has the chance to be a complete player, though heâs not as advanced as some of the prep outfielders who get to play more baseball.While his ORGANIZATION experience, playing in GPE in the ORGANIZATION AAA/18U World Championships, was up-and-down, PERSON was the ORGANIZATION of the PERSON All-American Classic, going 2-for-3 with a triple for the LOCATION team.",0
"PERSON made just four appearances for FACILITY A&M as a freshman before leading the Aggies with eight saves last spring. He has been even better as a junior, allowing just two earned runs while posting a 47/4 K/BB ratio in 41 2/3 innings through conference tournament play. He has pitched his way into the first five rounds of the Draft.Though PERSON never has started a game at FACILITY A&M, he could get the opportunity to do so in pro ball because he has three pitches and pumps strikes repeatedly. He works with a 93-96 mph fastball coming out of the bullpen, so he should have more than enough velocity if he shifts to the rotation. His second-best pitch is a changeup that he disguises well and features splitter action.PERSON threw more of a true slider in the past but has employed more of a hybrid breaking ball this year, both of which are average offerings. His lack of size costs him plane on his pitches and his long arm action gives hitters a good look at the ball, yet he doesn't get hit.",0
"PERSON tapped LOCATION A&M JC for a pair of GPE picks in 2014, grabbing right-hander LOCATION in the 11th round and GPE in the 16th. Signed for $25,000, GPE broke out in '16, batting .319/.428/.528 with 15 homers and 43 steals and leading the Minors in on-base percentage. While playing at a launching pad at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Lancaster boosted his numbers, he performed even better in Double-A and continued to stand out in the ORGANIZATION, but he struggled in a return to Double-A this year before going to the A's in a November trade. He's a similar athlete to fellow PERSON outfield prospect PERSON, though GPE is a better pure hitter with less power potential. He has good patience and uses the entire field, though there are some concerns about how much his simple right-handed swing will translate into power against better pitching. If he can cut down his strikeout rate, he could become a high-OBP player with 10-15 homers per year.GPE could fit nicely in the leadoff spot because he pairs his on-base skills with plus speed and the know-how to steal bases. He's more of an average defender in center field, better on the corners and capable of playing all three spots with his average arm. Nicknamed ""The ORGANIZATION"" for his relentless work ethic, he'll get the most out of his ability.",1
"PERSON was up to 96 in high school, often sitting in the low-90s. He was 90-92 this fall with an average slider that has horizontal wipe during instructs. He's a big-framed projection arm whose stuff hasn't ascended yet.",0
"GPE first arrived on the national scene as a sophomore when he tossed a complete-game win in the opening round of ORGANIZATION's 2012 ORGANIZATION. Now he's one of the more intriguing two-way players in the country.GPE could go on to play two ways for the ORGANIZATION of GPE, and he does like playing the infield. Seeing him in the ORGANIZATION rotation and at third base isn't a stretch. Most pro teams like him on the mound as a projectable right-hander who already has a good feel for pitching.GPE has a four-pitch mix, though none of the offerings grade out as better than average right now. He has a clean and easy delivery and the kind of frame that suggests he could add some velocity as he matures.The team that sees that projection in GPE, especially if he focuses on pitching only, and believes it can sign him away from his GPE commitment, will be the one to take the ORGANIZATION right-hander in the early rounds.",1
"Undrafted out of high school and after his first year at FACILITY (ORGANIZATION.) ORGANIZATION, PERSON went 17th overall in June 2013 after leading PERSON junior college players in hitting (.495) and on-base percentage (.568). Signed for $2,164,000, he went straight to low Class A, and he looked like he belonged. PERSON has continued to make progress in his first full pro season this year, though he was sidelined when an errant pitch broke his right wrist in late June.PERSON was known more as a point guard at GPE (Ala.) High, which he led to a 6A basketball state championship in 2011, yet he has advanced instincts at the plate. He understands the value of working counts to get on base, where he can use his well-above-average speed to put pressure on the defense. PERSON has a quick bat and some wiry strength, so he could develop some gap power.Leading up to the 2013 Draft, some scouts projected PERSON more as a center fielder than a shortstop, but the FACILITY Sox have no plans to move him off his current position. PERSON has the actions, range and arm to play short, and he has the work ethic to make the necessary refinements.",1
"The Friday night starter for the ORGANIZATION of GPE as a sophomore and junior, PERSON helped lead the Cavaliers to their first ORGANIZATION title in his first year in that role, then followed it up with a strong junior campaign. Seen as a rather safe college performer who was more high floor than high ceiling, he lasted until the end of the second round, where the ORGANIZATION gave him an above-pick value bonus of $1.1 million.PERSON features a heavy fastball up to 93-94 mph, sitting more in the 90-92 mph range. It's more about the plus sink than the velocity and the right-hander gets a ton of groundball outs. He'll throw two breaking balls -- a curve he uses to get strike one and a better slider with good, late bite that often serves as his out pitch. He can mix in a solid changeup with good movement.Starting pitchers from GPE haven't fared well in the pro game, but PERSON seems a good bet to reach his ceiling, even if it's not as high as some others. After a heavy workload this spring, he'll be used sparingly this summer, really getting his pro career started in earnest in 2017.",0
"PeÃ±a missed all of 2015 and 2016 due to injury and is a bit behind other 21-year-olds, having thrown just 30 innings above rookie ball thus far. But he has three big league offerings and filled up the strike zone in 2018, so he could move quickly if he stays healthy. PeÃ±a's delivery is pretty rough and features quite a bit of violence about his head. This, along with his lengthy injury history, has created worries about his health, and hinders his ability to locate with precision, as he throws strikes but not always where he wants to. Perception about PeÃ±a's health may drive GPE to move him quickly so he can reach the majors before he breaks again. His stuff appeared close to ready last year, as he worked in the mid-90s with armside movement that pairs well with his power, and a mid-80s changeup, while his lower arm slot enables his slider to play against righties. He started last year but we like him as a three-pitch middle relief prospect.",0
"PERSON was having a fine start to his 2012 season with short-season Vancouver when a broken hand knocked him out of action after just 11 games. He did eventually return to action, joining full-season Lansing at the end of the year and starting in center for their short-lived playoff run. The native of GPE's best tool is his speed and it should allow him to steal bases (he's gone 32-for-35 thus far in his career) and play center field. He has good range as a result and could be an above-average defender as he improves his reads and routes. PERSON does have a chance to hit a little bit, albeit without much power, but as a top-of-the-order type, that's not as important.",1
"PERSON stood out as a prep sophomore for his big raw power and arm strength, both as a catcher and a pitcher in the low-90s on the mound. He peaked early in that regard, signing for $100,000 late in the 2016 draft when his catching and hitting didn't progress and he was mostly just a mid-90s arm that occasionally showed command or a breaking ball. That projection has mostly held, as three years later PERSON has reached Double-A as a short reliever, but his breaking ball is consistently average to above and his command has improved, so there's a clear path to becoming a middle reliever. The ORGANIZATION acquired him in late 2017 in the ORGANIZATION deal with GPE.",0
"PERSON' father, PERSON, is a longtime college coach, allowing PERSON to spend a lot of time around the diamond. His upbringing shows and he has a good feel for the game. PERSON was a two-way prospect in high school, but the ORGANIZATION will develop him as a position player. His range and size are well suited for third base. He has a strong arm (he was clocked in the low-90s off the mound in high school) and has the ability to become a solid defender. Offensively, PERSON has good power. He has a solid approach at the plate, but some scouts wondered this spring how much he would hit against more advanced pitching. Thanks to his all-around profile, the ORGANIZATION will give him plenty of opportunities to make the necessary adjustments.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"After impressing during his full-season debut in 2012, PERSON was hampered by injuries in '13. He missed the first half of the season after undergoing surgery during Spring Training to repair a torn meniscus.PERSON is now back to full strength and looks as good as ever. He throws his fastball in the low-90s with heavy sinking action, mixing it with a solid slider and a changeup. PERSON does a good job of throwing strikes and keeping the ball down in the zone.PERSON was a part of the same Oklahoma high school class as PERSON and PERSON. Though he doesn't have their upside, PERSON has what it takes to be a big league starter.",1
"While at GPE (Wash.) JC, GPE underwent PERSON surgery in the fall of 2010 and missed all of 2011 and much of 2012 as a result. His arm strength returned in 2013, impressively enough for the ORGANIZATION to draft him in the fourth round. After a good start to his first full professional season, the ORGANIZATION acquired him in July as part of their return for PERSON. GPE' best pitch by far is his fastball, which sits in the low 90s, can reach 95 mph and features life as well as velocity. His secondary pitches are more works in progress, with his spike curveball showing more promise than his changeup. At 6-foot-4 and 205 pounds, GPE has the build to be a starter and has pitched well in that role after spending most of his debut as a reliever. To remain in the rotation, he'll have to throw more strikes and refine his curveball and changeup.",0
"Injuries robbed PERSON of much of his last two seasons and brought about a move to the bullpen in 2018. While lightning quick, his arm action is quite violent, which detracts from PERSON's command and has created a perception of heightened injury risk. But he also has an upper-90s fastball and plus changeup when healthy and reached Double-A as a 21-year-old last year. The Cardinals are incentivized to extract big league value out of PERSON while he's healthy and has good stuff, so it's possible we see him and his high-leverage offering as early as next year. ",1
"Former big leaguer PERSON has done a tremendous job since he took over as head coach of GPE Canyon University, moving the school from ORGANIZATION II to a successful ORGANIZATION I program and seeing eight of his players get drafted along the way. None of them has been taken before the ninth round, but GPE, who moved from the bullpen as a freshman to the Friday night starter the last two years, should easily surpass his predecessors.GPE has a solid enough three-pitch mix that he should be given every opportunity to start. He will throw his fastball in the 90-94 range, sitting around 92-94 consistently, while occasionally touching 96 mph occasionally. His fastball has been fairly true without a ton of deception to it this spring, so he does get hit at times more than you'd think. His changeup might be the better secondary offering. He sells it well with arm speed, some arm side fade, showing more deception with that than he does his fastball. His slider is average, with some late break to it.GPE throws strikes and has a solid feel for pitching, which gives him a chance to start. He did pitch out of the bullpen while on the GPE, with an uptick in velocity, providing a solid backup plan. But a team taking the right-hander in the top few rounds will see him as a future member of a rotation.",0
"PERSON didn't generate any headlines when he signed for $225,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2012, but he has attracted plenty of attention since making his GPE debut two years later. He started drawing comparisons to Jose PERSON and teams almost immediately started asking for him in trade talks. After leading the Minors with 82 steals when he made the jump to full-season ball in 2015, he's putting together a nice encore in high Class A -- with the exception of a two-week suspension for insubordination in July that cost him a trip to the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON Game.A true top-of-the-scale runner, PERSON can get from the right side of the plate to first base in less than 4.0 seconds and has basestealing skills to boot, succeeding on 83 percent of his attempts in his first four pro seasons. More than just a slap-and-dash guy, he has wiry strength and displays solid raw power during batting practice that has yet to manifest itself during games. He could develop into a 15-homer threat, though getting on base is a higher priority and he'll need to tighten up his strike zone to do that.Initial scouting reports on PERSON raised some concerns about his throwing arm, but it has gotten stronger and now grades as a plus tool. With his actions, range, hands and arm, he'll stay at shortstop for the long term. He needs to improve his defensive consistency after making 30 errors in 99 games last year.",0
"PERSON is a big-bodied late bloomer from GPE Florida who wasn't a top notch recruit but developed into an elite prospect in his sophomore year in GPE. He took a softer 6-foot-6, 270 body and got in better shape for the spring, and it took a high effort relief type into a possible workhorse mid-rotation starter. PERSON still stands out for his fastball/slider combo and the changeup and command are around average, so it may be more of a power multi-inning arm than a true 200-inning starter, but his two best features are also ORGANIZATION friendly. This means that progressive clubs see a quick-moving arm with PERSON McCullers-type qualities, and traditional ones see someone they could mold into a power starter.",0
"Coming into 2018, scouts were divided as to which of PERSON's two potential first-round position players was better. PERSON has more all-around ability and won the ORGANIZATION MVP award last summer, but PERSON posted better numbers there and does a better job of tapping into his considerable power potential. PERSON easily settled the argument with a superior junior season, thrusting himself into consideration as a top-five-overall pick.PERSON manages the strike zone very well and makes consistent hard contact from the right side of the plate. He doesn't strike out as much as PERSON, has an edge in bat speed and his stroke is more geared to generate power at this point. He understands that he doesn't have to sell out to hit home runs, so he doesn't.PERSON doesn't offer much when he's outside of the batter's box, however. Though he has worked diligently to improve at third base, he lacks quickness and range, his hands are just fair and his arm is only average. He'll probably wind up at first base but has the offensive upside to profile there.",0
"Despite dealing with some injuries, PERSON carried over a strong Cape Cod League performance to his junior season at ORGANIZATION and landed at the end of the first round in the 2013 Draft. While he's not the biggest guy in the world, he does have a solid approach at the plate and the chance to hit for more power than you'd expect from a guy his size. When he's healthy -- an ankle issue slowed him during his junior year -- he has plus speed that should help him be an asset on both sides of the ball. He played a lot of center field at ORGANIZATION, but while he got some time there during his pro debut, he was playing more right field in his first summer with the ORGANIZATION. He has the arm, and potentially the bat, to profile well there in the future.",0
"PERSON was a three-year starter at shortstop for GPE, helping the GPE make the ORGANIZATION World Series as a freshman in 2014. Unlike most college shortstops, he has a good chance to stick at the position, which helped him go in the sixth round of the 2016 Draft. He has hit better than expected at the onset of his pro career, even holding his own in Double-A after getting promoted there out of necessity in late June.Nevertheless, it's PERSON's glove that will be his ticket to the big leagues. He has smooth middle-infield actions, solid range to both sides and arm strength to match. He has shuttled between shortstop and second base while also seeing action at third base and in center field, hinting at his possible future as a utilityman.PERSON offers little pop at the plate, so he mainly focuses on making contact from the right side. He has decent plate discipline and fits best at the bottom of a batting order. Though he's just an average runner out of the batter's box, he plays quicker on the bases and has the savvy to accrue some steals.",0
"A 2017 Rule 5 selection by the ORGANIZATION, PERSON was immediately flipped to GPE for international bonus space and spent much of 2018 recovering from PERSON. He started a rehab assignemnt in mid-July and made his major league debut in September, his stuff mostly back to pre-ORGANIZATION form. He topped out at 98 and broke off plenty of nasty sliders, but his command and the quality of break on the slider were inconsistent, which is typical of those returning from ORGANIZATION. PERSON's delivery is odd. His swivels about an axis created by a stiff front leg. It makes it hard for him to get over his front side and is difficult to repeat. This, combined with his injury history, mean he's perceived as a risk for chronic health issues. 
If he can stay healthy, he could pitch at the back of a bullpen. Rule 5 roster requirements state that a drafted player needs to be on his new team's big league roster for 90 days for his new club to keep him, which means PERSON needs to stay with the ORGANIZATION through April and May or else be offered back to the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON's sinking mid-90s fastball and curveball don't play that well off of one another and he may not miss as many bats as one might expect given each pitch's pure nastiness. But he should induce a ton of ground balls, throw a high ratio of strikes, and pitch in the middle of GPE's rotation for many years.",1
"As a freshman at ORGANIZATION, PERSON lived in the shadows of 2011 first-rounders PERSON and PERSON. He emerged as the ORGANIZATION ace the following year, and then led them to a ORGANIZATION World Series championship in 2013, the same year the ORGANIZATION drafted him in the 11th round. PERSON didn't hit his stride as a professional until his second pro season in 2015, when he paced all ORGANIZATION farmhands with a 2.39 ORGANIZATION and 0.93 WHIP while making 27 starts between Class A Advanced PERSON and Double-A Akron. He enjoyed similar success in his second tour of the LOCATION in 2016, resulting in a mid-season promotion to Triple-A Columbus for the right-hander.PERSON may not have overpowering stuff, but everything he throws plays up thanks to his plus control and feel for sequencing. The right-hander is adept at painting both sides of the plate with his fastball, which usually sits around 90-91 mph but can reach 94. His changeup is his best secondary offering, receiving an above-average grade from scouts, and he knows how to keep hitters off balance with both his slider and curveball, with the former currently ahead of the latter.PERSON's advanced pitchability has helped him make a smooth transition to the ORGANIZATION, but it's the across-the-board improvement of his stuff that has enabled him to move quickly and gives him a real chance to become a back-end starter at the highest level.",0
"PERSON got the attention of GPE area scouts last year when he was regularly in the mid-90's with starter traits, and that carried over to a dominating Cape performance where he sat 92-96 with above average command and off-speed. This spring he started, as many pitchers do, a couple ticks lower but instead of getting back to his old velocity, it continued to slip amid a number of high pitch count outings. PERSON has taken the ball every week and has performed well, with velocity ranging from 88-91, touching 92 mph in some starts, and sitting 90-94, touching 95 in others, including his last few before regionals.

The command, frame and athleticism are stable constants, so he'll still go comfortably in the first round, but there isn't a clear reason for the velo drop. Some scouts are speculating it's a small injury that won't keep him from pitching right now, but shutting him down may bring the velo back next spring. Others think PERSON would (as many pitchers do) lose a few ticks under a pro workload and become this guy in a few years anyway. PERSON close enough to contention that want immediate pitching help are on PERSON, like the ORGANIZATION, PERSON and GPE.",1
"GPE bats with 30-grade plate discipline are scary, but PERSON has the talent to override his impatience and so far he has performed in spite of it. In possession of a picturesque swing and some of the most electric bat speed in the minors, PERSON has a .306/.347/.478 career line over four pro seasons, and he's been young for each of the levels to which he has been assigned. As awestruck as his swing leaves onlookers, it is imperfect and causes him to drive the ball into the ground about 50% of the time. He hits it so hard that it hasn't mattered yet, and it may not be prudent to tweak PERSON's swing so long as he keeps performing, but the ceiling on his power output is huge if his bat path gets dialed in. This is a pretty traditional right field profile, instability and all, and PERSON has a chance to hit at the heart of a big league lineup. He got a taste of Double-A late last year and should return there in 2019.",0
"It can take the raw, toolsy athletes a little bit longer to develop at times, but PERSON could look back at the 2013 season as the year where it really started coming together.Tall and athletic, PERSON looks the part of a toolsy center fielder and now needs to build on his first extended success. He's started to learn to tap into his raw power, pulling the ball with authority instead of being satisfied with going up the middle and the other way. There's still some length and swing and miss to PERSON's game, but if he can continue to punish mistakes on the inner half, he could be dangerous. With enough speed to steal some bases, PERSON has the tools to stay in center, but he could handle a corner if needed.Patience can be a virtue with athletic players like PERSON, and the ORGANIZATION could soon be rewarded as a result.",1
"PERSON won the Big West Conference batting title in 2014, when he hit .386 as a sophomore at ORGANIZATION. He continued to improve his ORGANIZATION stock that summer while playing for the GPE collegiate national team, though his campaign was cut short due to a shoulder injury that ultimately required offseason labrum surgery. It kept him from playing the field until the second half of his junior season, but he still went in the third round of the ORGANIZATION and signed for $550,000.PERSON is one of the purest hitters in GPE's system. A right-handed hitter, he makes a lot on contact and sprays line drives across the whole field. His advanced approach and ability to control the strike zone fuels his on-base skills, and he walked almost as often as he struck out during his pro debut at ORGANIZATION A Short PERSON. Though he projects for below-average power, PERSON could still produce double digits in home runs thanks to his strength and knack for barreling the ball.PERSON has fringy speed and defensive ability, and his arm will be no better than average if it bounces all the way back. While he had proved to be a versatile infielder before getting hurt, the Indians primarily have used him at second base, while also giving him occasional work at shortstop and third base.",0
"PERSON knee issues and constant setbacks kept him off the field for most of last season. When healthy he has a typical right field profile, with power and perhaps some strikeouts. He's a hard working player and GPE's best prospect.",0
"PERSON State grabbed two of the better pitching prospects from GPE for its recruiting class, though both PERSON (ORGANIZATION, GPE) and PERSON began turning their projection into reality this spring and thus may not get to PERSON. PERSON helped PERSON win its first-ever district title and breeze through the first three rounds of the state 5-A playoffs, tossing three complete-game victories (including two shutouts) in his first three postseason starts.While PERSON has a pair of potential plus pitches in his fastball and curveball, both still require some work. He operates at 90-94 mph, reaches 96 and holds the velocity on his heater deep into games, but it gets hit harder than it should because batters see the ball well coming out of his long arm action and high slot. He spins his upper-70s curveball with power and depth, though he sometimes struggles to land it in the strike zone. PERSON also needs to refine his changeup, which should happen as he uses it more often against better hitters. He features effort in his delivery and may be able to tone it down a bit without sacrificing the quality of his stuff once he gets stronger.",0
"In just his first full season of pro ball, this Longwood product put up eye-popping numbers while reaching Double-A. He topped the organization in saves and struck out 13.8 per nine innings. That kind of performance continued in the ORGANIZATION, leaving him poised to potentially make an impact out of the ORGANIZATION' bullpen soon. While he is up to 93 mph with his fastball, his best pitch is a nasty slider that has sharp bite and tilt. He pitches with deception, giving him even more swing-and-miss ability. Whether he closes at the big league level remains to be seen, but he should be ready to get big league hitters out in 2013.Bernie Pleskoff's scouting report Â»",0
"PERSON had a bit of a breakthrough in 2018, teaching himself a splitter that flashes plus in the second half when he wasn't happy with how his breaking ball was coming out of his hand. One pro scout we spoke with saw PERSON once early, when he was into the upper-90's with a plus-flashing breaking ball, then saw him later with the same heater and the plus-flashing splitter, only this time, he wasn't throwing the breaking ball much. That scout said if all three elements were together at once, it would be something like PERSON (who was a 55 or 60 PV/FV at his peak). There's some obvious risk that PERSON's stuff plays below it's peak 2018 showings, that his command is a bit below average, and that his size limits him to multi-inning relief, in which case he's more of a 40 or 45 FV reliever who dazzles at times. He probably isn't a 180 inning starter, but PERSON will be one to watch early in 2019 to see what sort of stuff he's showing. He could be the next Phillies Latin power arm to be moved to relief who then shoots to the big leagues after PERSON, PERSON and PERSON. We like the makeup and ability to make adjustments, so expect his grade to be higher in 2019 if he continues doing what he did in 2018.",0
"A classic, big-framed, power projection outfielder who currently runs well enough to try center field, but there's questions on the hitability.",0
"PERSON was an under-the-radar prospect as an amateur, one who wasn't drafted out of high school or when he was eligible at ORGANIZATION as a redshirt sophomore. The son and nephew of professional baseball players, PERSON did put himself on the map as a junior, but still wasn't taken until the ORGANIZATION nabbed him in the seventh round of the 2017 GPE. He was sent straight to the Class A Advanced PERSON for his full season debut and excelled there, putting him on a path to easily surpass expectations.Lean and athletic with wiry strength, PERSON can do a lot of things well on the field. While there was some concern about swing and miss coming from a grooved swing, PERSON managed his strikeout rate well and drew walks while showing the ability to consistently impact the ball. PERSON home runs might not sound like a lot, but in the pitching-friendly PERSON, it's not bad and he has the potential for 12-15 homers a year. His speed is plus, and sometimes grades out as a 70 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale, allowing him to be a basestealing threat (he finished third in the system with 33 steals in 2018) and allowing him to play a solid defensive center field.PERSON has shown steady improvement since joining the organization and could be a steal of his GPE class. He might end up being a fourth outfielder when all is said and done, but don't be shocked if he shoots past that ceiling as well.",0

With the ORGANIZATION, PERSON competed in the 2014 15U ORGANIZATION Championship, 2014 15U ORGANIZATION and the 2015 15U ORGANIZATION. As a member of the 2015 15U ORGANIZATION, PERSON recorded just four at-bats but hit .500 with one RBI, three walks and three runs scored in his limited playing time for a team that went on to finish 8-1 at of the 2015 ORGANIZATION ""AA"" PERSON.",0
"The epitome of the high risk, high reward high school hitter, the ORGANIZATION rolled the dice a bit by taking PERSON in the sandwich round of the 2014 Draft and giving him $445,100 over pick value to sign. No one in the 2014 Draft class has as much raw power as PERSON does and he displayed it in big settings as an amateur. The only question is if he'll make enough contact to allow that power to be usable in games. The bat speed is there, but his swing mechanics need to be cleaned up, as he has struck out in more than 32 percent of his at-bats during his brief pro career. PERSON is a good athlete with good hands and a strong arm, so he can stay at shortstop for the time being, though some think that once his 6-foot-5 frame fills out, he'll need to move to third. PERSON will be the key in letting PERSON's offensive game to develop, and he wasn't ready for full-season ball, getting bumped down to the ORGANIZATION this summer. If everything clicks, he could be a dynamic run produer in the middle of a big league lineup.",0
"PERSON could have gone in the top three rounds as a ORGANIZATION high schooler in 2014 if he weren't set on attending PERSON, where he developed into a potential ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick for 2017. Though he was the best college athlete available, his college strikeout rate (24 percent) raised concerns about his hitting ability and enabled him to slide all the way to GPE at ORGANIZATION. 23. After signing for a slightly over-slot $2,897,500, he batted just .221 in low Class A while whiffing at a 27 percent clip.If PERSON hits, he'll be a star, and the ORGANIZATION are encouraged by the adjustments he began to make to his setup and left-handed swing during instructional league. His tendency to miss hittable pitches at times and his so-so selectivity create questions about his pitch recognition. But he also has the bat speed and deceptive strength to hit 15-20 homers per season and the plus-plus speed to be a basestealing threat.PERSON can help a team win in multiple ways even if he doesn't hit for a high average. In addition to his speed and power, he also provides quality center-field defense and has a stronger arm than most players at the position. He has earned comparisons to a vintage PERSON.",0
"PERSON ORGANIZATION Sr. stole 463 bases during a 13-year big league career, and PERSON has shown similar ability as he has climbed through the Minors. The eighth overall pick in the 2010 Draft by the ORGANIZATION, the younger ORGANIZATION signed for $2.125 million and broke out with a 101-steal year in 2012. He endured a difficult 2014 season, getting hit in the face by a pitch and struggling in Double-A before the ORGANIZATION claimed him in the Rule 5 Draft in December.ORGANIZATION fits in nicely in a GPE farm system loaded with toolsy players. His well-above average speed is his best attribute, and unlike most speedsters, he can do more than run. He has enough pop to produce double-digit home run totals and he has a penchant for drawing walks.After breaking into pro ball briefly as a center fielder, ORGANIZATION spent his first three full seasons at second base before moving back to center in 2014. He still needs to refine his jumps and routes, but his speed gives him good range. His below-average arm isn't a liability in center.",1
" PERSON teamed with J.J. PERSON during high school to give PERSON Gardens a formidable one-two punch in the middle of its lineup. He has steadily improved over the past year and should closely follow PERSON on GPE day.  PERSON is a two-way player and will continue to play both ways if he upholds his commitment to GPE. But professional scouts are most interested in him as a hitter. He has a short swing and uses a mature approach at the plate, enabling him to make more contact than most power hitters. He has solid pop, thanks to his strength and leverage in his swing.  PERSON plays first base well and may be athletic enough to handle an outfield corner. He certainly has the arm for it, as his fastball reaches 90 mph on the mound.",0
"PERSON's big, physical frame and triple-digit fastball made him a legitimate candidate to be the first-overall pick in the 2014 Draft. He ended up going second overall to the ORGANIZATION and signed for a franchise-record $6 million. He had an inconsistent but promising first full season in the Class A GPE ORGANIZATION and showed up to Spring Training in 2016 in better shape. However, PERSON's season was over before it started, as an elbow injury suffered during Spring Training resulted in PERSON surgery in early April.Though he showcased elite velocity as an amateur, PERSON worked more in the low- to mid-90s during his full-season debut. He throws his heater with heavy sinking action that leads to many groundouts and few home runs. Both PERSON's slider and changeup are below average, and that lack of an out pitch limits his bat-missing ability. He did make some strides with the former before getting hurt, throwing it with improved depth and power.The ORGANIZATION worked with PERSON to refine his delivery during his rehab process with the hope that it would help him regain some velocity, as well as better command. After a 15-month absence, the big right-hander finally returned to the mound in game action in July 2017. He may be well behind the development curve, but if he can stay healthy and everything clicks, PERSON still could reach his ceiling of a No. 2 or 3 starter.",0
"A former traditional power-based RF prospect faded into minor league free agency due to contact issues, then had a big swing adjustment and a solid 2019 in Triple-A Louisville -- .299/.356/.636 -- before coming up in GPE and having one of the hotter first weeks a hitter has ever had, homering eight times in his first twelve games. He hasn't had any underlying change to his numbers, all of PERSON's strikeout and walk rates, as well as his batted ball profile, are in line with his career averages, but his swing change is visually similar to PERSON's and new Reds hitting coach, PERSON, comes from an org (ORGANIZATION) that has had success tweaking older hitters. We think there's a chance PERSON performs the way PERSON has since his debut, big power and lower OBPs from a corner outfield spot. There's a chance that's a 50 FV type player but PERSON's track record of fringe contact and plate discipline tempers our expectations about him sustaining that level of production.",1
"Many teams considered GPE to be one of, if not the best on-mound athletes among high schoolers in the 2018 draft, but many of them also thought he was sushi raw as both a hurler and an outfielder, and that he would end up at the ORGANIZATION of GPE. A $700,000 bonus brought him to GPE for a summer free of pitching in games, an approach the GPE have taken with several recent draftees. GPE did hit, though. While he struggled to perform on paper, he has a pro-quality power and speed combination that enabled him to play center field in high school. He was drafted and will be developed as a two-way player, likely pitching once a week while playing in the outfield once or twice a week and DH'ing the rest of the time as a way to manage fatigue. He arrived for camp having added about 25 pounds of muscle and is one of the more interesting prospects in baseball, let alone in this system, because he's just a very athletic, untouched mass of clay for GPE player development to sculpt.",0
"A two-way player at ORGANIZATION, PERSON had more success as an outfielder than as a pitcher before having PERSON surgery that cost him his entire 2017 junior season. The ORGANIZATION still took him in the 12th round that June, signing him for an above-slot $247,500. They didn't have him make his pro debut until May 2018 and didn't fully turn him loose until this season, when he has been one of the top breakout performers in the system.Extremely athletic and possessing a quick arm, PERSON usually operates at 92-96 mph with late finish on his fastball. Though he's relatively inexperienced on the mound, he actually shows more present feel for his changeup than for his breaking ball. He'll flash some solid curveballs and also is working on a cutter.PERSON still has a lot to learn on the mound, which is understandable. He doesn't always attack hitters as much as he should, and his ability to locate his pitches will determine whether he winds up as a starter or reliever. If he can come up with a reliable breaking pitch and trust his stuff, he might be a No. 3 starter.",0
"Coming out of GPE (Okla.) High in 2013, PERSON could have gone in the top three rounds had he been considered signable. Instead, he lasted until the ORGANIZATION took him in the 32nd round and headed to PERSON. After he missed all of 2015 with a sprained ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow that didn't require surgery, he has worked his way back into the first three rounds during a spring in which he threw three consecutive shutouts and won Big 12 Conference pitcher of the year honors.The Cowboys have dropped PERSON's arm slot to low three-quarters, adding more life to his stuff. The redshirt sophomore can sit at 91-94 mph with his fastball deep into games and top out at 96. He doesn't miss a ton of bats but the running and sinking life on his heater generates a lot of groundouts.PERSON's new arm slot lends itself well to a slider, and his low-80s breaking ball is a plus pitch at times and he can throw it to both sides of the plate. He has feel for a changeup and for commanding his pitches, so it's easy to project him as a starter at the next level.",0
"PERSON ranked No. 1 on MLB.com's Top 20 international prospects list last summer and he received one of 10 seven-figure bonuses handed out to international amateurs during the signing period, coming to terms on the opening day of the period. He's yet to make any kind of debut, either in the ORGANIZATION or in the GPE, but he's dazzled scouts with his bat speed, hitting mechanics and raw power. He's also opened eyes with his speed and instincts on the bases. His all-around speed combined with his aggressive style, strong arm and athletic body have brought about comparisons to GPE outfielder PERSON when he was the same age.",0
"A.J. PERSON might be the more ""famous"" ORGANIZATION of GPE starter, but it's been PERSON who has been the ORGANIZATION' Friday night starter for all three years of his college career. He's more about pitchability than stuff, but that's led to a ton of success in the ultra-competitive SEC.Strong and durable, PERSON is a strike-throwing machine with a potential three-pitch mix. He typically works with an average fastball velocity-wise, but it plays up because of his command. His best pitch is his changeup, which he locates and sinks extremely well. Even when hitters know it's coming, he still gets outs. PERSON's breaking ball is slurvy and a bit inconsistent. When it's on, it can be virtually unhittable and has the potential of being a third Major League average offering.The lack of an explosive fastball limits his ceiling and, as a result, his ORGANIZATION stock. There's no question PERSON is the first Gator pitcher to go off the board and some others could pass PERSON by because of the fastball, but whatever team takes PERSON will be getting a college performer who should be quick to the big leagues as a back-end starter.",0
"PERSON was known more as a pitcher early in his amateur days, even getting drafted as a left-hander by the Twins when he was in junior college in 2014. His bat came alive the following year after he transferred to PERSON and his upside as a hitter got the ORGANIZATION to take a chance on him with a 15th-round selection. He's shown glimpses of putting his tools into production, playing 2018 in Double-A, then really standing out with a strong ORGANIZATION performance to earn a spot on the 40-man roster.On any given day, PERSON will show all five tools. Given that he didn't really start focusing on his offensive game until college, he's still learning to hit. He made some adjustments to his swing at the end of his 2018 season, adding a small leg kick to replace a toe tap with strong results, especially in the ORGANIZATION. It allowed him to keep his weight back, wait on breaking balls more and lay off of ones out of the strike zone, something that has previously plagued him. It should help him tap into his easily plus raw power more consistently. He runs very well for his size and while he has seen time in all three outfield spots, he fits the profile of an athletic power-hitting right fielder with a plus arm.Because of his size, athleticism and tools, PERSON sometimes gets PERSON comps, minus the plus hit tool. That's an unfair standard obviously, but there is ceiling for PERSON to still grow into.",0
"GPE was the second college catcher taken in the 2013 Draft, largely because of his defensive ability. He's been as good as advertised, if not better, with the hope that perhaps there's a little offense to come, though he struggled with the bat as he moved up to Double-A in 2015.It will be GPE's glove that gets him to the big leagues. He's a very good receiver who handles a pitching staff well and has a good feel for calling a game. His strong and accurate arm has allowed him to throw out better than a third of would-be basestealers, and he has the natural leadership qualities teams love to have in a catcher. GPE made some progress at the plate early in his pro career, making consistent contact, and there is strength for him to tap into some moderate raw power. Even with his offensive progress stalled, GPE has the skills to be a defensive-oriented backstop. If the bat can come alive again, he might have the goods to be a starting one in the big leagues in the future.",0
"PERSON is an above average runner underway with a long, projectable frame and future plus power but limited track record of performance.",0
"Sometimes amateur players are late bloomers, especially on the mound. GPE wasn't drafted out of high school but moved up ORGANIZATION boards as PERSON's Friday starter.Tall and lean on a 6-foot-5 frame, GPE has some room to fill out. And what he has is already pretty good. The left-hander pitches downhill with natural cutting movement on his fastball. His short, sharp slider is an out pitch at times. He has solid feel for a changeup, though it's still a work in progress. GPE is generally around the plate with all of his pitches and has been one of the nation's top strikeout pitchers.There's still some upside to GPE as he continues to fill out, giving him the chance to be in a big league rotation in the future.",0
"The ORGANIZATION took a flier on PERSON in 15th round of the 2012 Draft even though the left-hander had suffered an elbow tear during his senior year at GPE (Ill.) High. He signed for $426,000 and ultimately underwent PERSON surgery later that year, costing him all of 2013. Though he returned to the mound the following year, injuries plagued PERSON once again in 2015, as he missed time with both elbow and shoulder pain. PERSON healthy in 2016, PERSON struggled out of the gate at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Dunedin but dominated following a demotion to ORGANIZATION A Lansing, finishing second in the ORGANIZATION in GPE (2.41). He fared considerably better in his return to the ORGANIZATION State League this season, ultimately earning a promotion to Double-A in July.PERSON has an 88-92 mph fastball that peaks at 94, with late movement that helps him to generate ground balls. His plus changeup plays nicely off of his heater because he throws it with similar arm speed, and it gives him a chance against right-handed hitters. PERSON's slider is less advanced than his changeup, with varying shape and pace, but it has the potential to be another Major League-average pitch. Despite missing parts of three seasons due to injury, PERSON has never lost his feel for pounding the zone with his entire arsenal.PERSON had just 68 2/3 career innings to his name before the 2016 season, but he answered questions about his durability by pitching 135 2/3 frames and making 26 starts. He's on pace to surpass that total in 2017 as he continues to show the ingredients needed to develop into a back-end starter.",1
"PERSON's exciting GPE debut in 2013, followed by his ability to hold his own in the LOCATION League in 2014, has the organization excited about his potential to become an everyday shortstop, even if it's way off in the future.Signed in 2011, PERSON performed very well in the short-season PERSON in '13. A left-handed-hitting shortstop, he has good bat speed at the plate, though added strength and a better knowledge of the strike zone will help his offensive game. PERSON has excellent speed, which should help him on both sides of the ball. He has the range and the arm to stay at shortstop long-term. PERSON is not going to move PERSON off of shortstop anytime soon, and the ORGANIZATION will be sure not to rush him, but PERSON does give GPE a middle infielder who will definitely stick at the premium position long-term.",0
"PERSON GPE hasn't had a player drafted since 2002, and none of the six Hornets selected have been taken before the 24th round. That will change this June, when PERSON's defensive prowess should make him a second-day pick in a Draft light on legitimate shortstops.The 2014 LOCATION Conference player of the year, PERSON has all the tools to play shortstop in the big leagues. He has smooth actions, quick hands and a strong, accurate arm. Though his pure speed doesn't grade as better than average, he still offers plenty of range at shortstop.The PERSON Rican-born PERSON stands out much more in the field at the plate. He's a switch-hitter who's better as a right-hander, though he'll need to tone down his approach to hit for a decent average. He won't provide much power and probably will fit toward the bottom of a lineup.",0
" GPE will make his GPE debut in 2013 after striking out 9.6 per nine in the ORGANIZATION. The athletic and wiry right-hander has electric stuff and can crank it up to 99 mph, maintaining that kind of velocity deep into starts. His slider has the chance to be a wipeout pitch. He handled his first visit to the GPE, at instructs, well, so the ORGANIZATION are hopeful he'll adjust easily. The key for him will be throwing strikes as well as developing a changeup. He'll begin as a starter, but there's a chance that he ends up in the back end of a bullpen someday.",1
"A young, polished, but relatively unexplosive high schooler, GPE was a bit of a surprise second rounder in 2017 but has quickly become much more interesting thanks to a sterling 2018 season with PERSON. As a 19-year-old, he hit .352/.405/.511 for the ORGANIZATION, torching even the loftiest of expectations set by scouts who saw him during extended spring training and mostly considered GPE a future utility man. Fundamentally sound at short, he lacks the explosiveness and big arm strength scouts look for at the position, and we wonder if GPE will hit for enough power to be an impact player at any other position. 
His early career strikeout rate (7.5% in about 450 PA) suggests his bat-to-ball skills are even more promising than amateur scouts anticipated, though he's also an aggressive swinger who has been hit by nearly twice as many pitches as he has walks so far. When scouts talk about a player having 'feel, polish, instincts' and the like, and the player has numbers like GPE's contact rates, we typically round up on that player. In GPE's case, we remain cautious because the eyeball scouts are so resolute in their skepticism of the power projection.",0
"PERSON made a splash in his professional debut, winning the ORGANIZATION MVP Award in 2012. But he was unable to build on that success in 2013. PERSON played on Opening Day in Class A Asheville, but he was then sent back to extended spring camp for disciplinary reasons. He returned to Asheville three weeks later, only to tear his right hamstring, ending his season in early May.PERSON is a pure hitter with an innate feel for putting the bat on the ball. He has some pop in his bat already and could develop above-average power as he physically matures.Before the injury, PERSON had above-average speed, and he used it well offensively and defensively. He covers ground well in the outfield and has a strong arm. PERSON appears to have recovered from what was essentially a lost year for him, getting back on track in 2014.",1
"PERSON wasn't a high-profile signing when he turned pro out of the ORGANIZATION in 2011, and his career has taken a while to get going. He repeated the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION in his first two years as a pro and the short-season LOCATION in the last two seasons. He emerged as one of the more intriguing lefties in the ORGANIZATION system in his return to the ORGANIZATION this year, leading the league in GPE (0.51), opponent average (.156) and K/BB ratio (12.3) before his first-ever promotion to full-season ball.In a year in which several of GPE's best southpaw pitching prospects have seen their stuff regress, PERSON has stood out with a lively 91-94 mph fastball that can reach 96. Both of his secondary pitches need more consistency, but his hard slider shows flashes of becoming a plus offering, and his changeup has a chance to become at least average.PERSON has matured significantly on the mound in 2016, doing a better job of challenging hitters and throwing strikes. He's gaining an understanding of sequencing pitches and recognizing swings that he has lacked in the past. Though he still has to prove he can sustain success, the progress he has made this year has been encouraging.",0

"Though PERSON shows no signs of ever slowing down, the ORGANIZATION invested in a pair of promising young third-base prospects in 2016. After signing PERSON for $675,000 as a third-round pick in June, they landed PERSON three months later for $1.1 million. He played two seasons in GPE's top league as a teenager, batting a combined .259/.335/.328.Like PERSON, PERSON doesn't have one standout tool but does possess the potential to contribute across the board. His raw right-handed power attracted the most attention from scouts, and he has the approach and hitting ability to translate it into game production. His speed reportedly has improved since he left GPE, with some evaluators now giving it above-average or plus grades.PERSON played five positions in GPE's PERSON: third base, first base, second base, right field and left field. He has average arm strength and should have enough quickness to stay at the hot corner. If he can't handle third base, the outfield corners are his likely next destination.",0
"A GPE product, PERSON ranked as one of the best pure high school hitters in the 2012 Draft, but slid to the ORGANIZATION in the 29th round because of his steadfast commitment to PERSON. The consensus national freshman of the year in 2013, he's now one of the top bats in this year's college crop.PERSON has an unconventional right-handed swing, but it works for him because he has a very quick bat and controls the strike zone well. He has some pull power and could develop average pop if he adds some loft to his stroke. He has average speed that plays up because of his instincts.Because of his size, tools and aggressive nature at the plate, he regularly gets compared to PERSON. Like PERSON, he appeared to be a college shortstop headed for second base in pro ball, but PERSON has looked better defensively this spring and may be able to stick at short. His arm and instincts allow him to make plays there, and he shows range to both sides.",1
"/15: PERSON to miss 2017 season after PERSON since PERSON joined the ORGANIZATION organization by moving to the ORGANIZATION from GPE and circumventing the Draft in 2012, he's had future frontline starter written all over him. Reaching Double-A and excelling in the ORGANIZATION in 2015 has him much closer to fulfilling that potential, though a 50-game suspension for marijuana use put a damper on the year.Assuming it's not a long-term issue, the suspension shouldn't derail PERSON for long. The big right-hander has serious swing-and-miss stuff, with a fastball that touches the mid-90s consistently and can hit triple digits to complement a devastating power curveball. Unlike some young pitchers, PERSON is willing to throw his changeup and understands the value of having it to make his two plus offerings better. Though it's behind the other two, it should be PERSON average in time.Command and control have been PERSON' biggest obstacles, but he's improved tremendously over the past couple of seasons, particularly in terms of his fastball command. If his progress continues, it won't be long before big league hitters will have to try and figure him out.",1
"PERSON was projected to be PERSON's top starter in 2014 before undergoing PERSON surgery, sidelining him for a part of the '15 season as well. However, he pitched well enough after his return to convince the FACILITY to select him in the fifth round of last year's Draft. PERSON healthy, PERSON impressed during his professional debut between the ORGANIZATION and GPE leagues and then followed it with a strong instructional league, showing a 93-96 mph fastball and a plus curveball. He also features a slider with average potential and has feel for a changeup. PERSON' 6-foot-1, 190-pound frame raises questions about his durability, though he hasn't had problems holding his velocity as a professional.While the FACILITY expect to deploy PERSON as a starter at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Winston-Salem in 2016, his two plus pitches also give him potential as a late-inning reliever, one who could move up the ladder quickly with a shift to the bullpen.",0
"PERSON got hot late in the year (he had a .400 OBP in July and August) and ended 2018 with a .302/.381/.438 line at ORGANIZATION. The leg kick he had while with PERSON is now gone, and the strength of PERSON' hands and his ability to move the bat head around the zone have led to sufficiently hard contact without it. 
Much of PERSON' profile depends upon his ability to stay in center field and the general consensus is that he's a 45 or 50 defender out there. We keep waiting for PERSON' ORGANIZATION to regress (it hasn't), and we expect his unusually high walk rate from 2018 to do eventually so as well (though, he was very selective in the ORGANIZATION), but ulimately he projects to be an average offensive player who is fine in center field, which would make him an everyday player of some kind. He turn 24 in January.",1
"PERSON was an intriguing two-way athlete on the showcase circuit, then hit 97 mph repeatedly early in his draft spring and moved into top two round contention. His stuff backed up a bit down the stretch. PERSON had not thrown as much as many of his peers and lacked their stamina, though this could be spun into a positive, namely PERSON's arm being relatively fresh. Late in the spring, he was working more in the low-90's rather than 93-96 mph, and his shorter stature and stride length led his fastball to be hittable. The Reds are gambling on the plus fastball returning as he builds strength, experience, and stamina in his arm in a starting role, and he has no. 3/4 starter potential with good, clear checkpoints to watch that will indicate improvement, including fastball rebound and maintaining his stuff into the summer.",0
"Plus-running infielders with some power aren't readily available, which made PERSON' acquisition an 11th round coup at $500,000. His frame and limited lateral agility made him likely to move off of shortstop, and PERSON is already seeing most of his playing time at third base. In possession of notable physical tools at age 20, but with relatively raw feel to hit, we have PERSON valued the way we would a good junior college prospect, and think he's an interesting developmental flier.",1
"A standout at GPE, where he was the ORGANIZATION of the Year, PERSON was nabbed in the fourth round of the 2013 Draft by the ORGANIZATION and showed athleticism and some ability to swing the bat during his first full year of pro ball.The Mobile native has played both first base and the outfield, seeing most of his time in right field in 2014. He has the athleticism for the position and perhaps the power profile from the left side of the plate. His solid first full season should be taken with a grain of salt as it came at a home park in GPE that is one of the most extreme hitters' parks in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON, however, do like his swing and think he has the chance to hit. Big and strong, PERSON also has the chance to develop more pop in the future. He has easy actions in the outfield and enough speed to be a bit of a base stealing threat.How PERSON's bat develops will ultimately determine what kind of role he has in the future. If the power does come, he has the chance to fit the profile of a prototypical right fielder down the road.",1
"PERSON dominated at the 18-and-under World Championships in the fall of 2012, but his stuff and delivery regressed when he pitched for GPE at the World Baseball Classic the following spring. That didn't deter the Cubs from signing him for $1.625 million as part of their 2013 international signing spree. He looked more like his old self during his 2014 pro debut, when he demonstrated the best pitchability in GPE's farm system.PERSON pitched in the low 90s early last season before settling in at 88-92 mph and a consistent peak of 94. Though he can locate his fastball on both sides of the plate, it may be just his third-best pitch. He has advanced feel for his changeup and can spin a tight curveball, both of which are plus offerings at their best.Though his frame is fairly mature, PERSON needs to build up his strength so he can maintain his stuff throughout a full season. But even when he tired in the second half last year, his command and his competitiveness allow him to continue to succeed. He had a 1.64 ERA in the final two months and won both of his playoff starts.",1
"ORGANIZATION started his ORGANIZATION career as a catcher/reliever, but he gave up being a backstop after his freshman year. He closed games as a sophomore and then began this year in the bullpen as well, but a transition into GPE's rotation has positively impacted his GPE stock.ORGANIZATION took over the team's Friday night rotation spot and showed he might have what it takes to stay in a rotation. He'll throw his fastball in the 91-94 mph range and holds his velo deep into his starts. Both of his secondary offerings are average and flash above-average, with perhaps more improvement to come if he gets the chance to develop as a starter. While he does not have the typical starting-pitcher build at 6-foot-1 and 210 pounds, he's strong and maintains his stuff. His control has taken a big step forward this spring as well.It's possible ORGANIZATION might be best-suited for the bullpen, where his fastball-curve combination could play up, though a team taking him in the top six rounds might want to send him out as a starter. Either way, he could be the best catcher-turned-pitcher to come out of GPE since PERSON, who moved from behind the plate to the mound at the pro level.",0
"  Drafted by the ORGANIZATION in 2010, PERSON was traded to the ORGANIZATION as a part of the two teams' 10-player deal in July 2012. His progress was slowed in 2014 by a strained lat that sidelined him for much of the first half, but he has been healthy this year and made his big league debut in April. PERSON throws his fastball in the low 90s, using both sides of the plate effectively. He mixes in a slider and changeup, but lacks a true out pitch. He works around the zone with his whole arsenal and does a lot of little things well, helping him to succeed without premium stuff. PERSON has been a starter throughout his career, but might end up fitting better in the bullpen in the long run. He appeared to be on the cusp of reaching the big leagues before his injury in 2014 and could soon be ready for his shot.",0
"After he looked like a newly-drafted force of nature during the summer of 2017, PERSON' physical tools actually regressed last year. The bat speed and quality of contact both dipped, and PERSON was noticeably out-shined by the other (mostly older) PERSON participants during batting practice. PERSON developed some feel for opposite field contact during this span, something he retained as the power returned this spring. He's hitting lasers to all fields now, adept at peppering the right center field gap. 
Built like, and as fast as, a bowling ball SEC running back, PERSON is going to stay in center field for a while but most scouts think he'll eventually move to a corner. That could be a problem if such a move occurs sooner than anticipated, as PERSON has had whiff/discipline issues in the past, though they've been much more palatable this year. He has Mitch Haniger/Randall Grichuk-ish tools. Staying in center will be important, as will retaining some of this new plate discipline. If both happen, PERSON is going to be a highly entertaining star.",0
"PERSON's prospect stock peaked when he was a dominant college sophomore at GPE. PERSON and a downtick in stuff plagued him as a junior and he fell to the fifth round of his draft. PERSON has traversed the whole of the minors as a starter but ultimately might fit best in relief due to some of his stuff's limitations. He has a funky, low-slot delivery that creates cuttery, horizontal movement on his slider. It's his best way to miss bats. His changeup and fastball (which was only in the upper-80s for much of his time in the ORGANIZATION) are both fringy on their own but play up a bit due to the deceptive funk in his delivery. PERSON fits in a No. 5 starter/swingman relief role, and could be ready in 2019.",0
"PERSON went undrafted out of a GPE high school in 2013 and then played sparingly as a freshman for ORGANIZATION before nearly winning the LOCATION Triple Crown and then starring in the ORGANIZATION in 2015. He repeated as ORGANIZATION player of the year in 2016 and ultimately took home the prestigious ORGANIZATION after contending for the ORGANIZATION Division I lead in batting (.395), on-base percentage (.535), home runs (20) and runs (70). The ORGANIZATION were elated to find PERSON still on the board with the 11th overall pick, and they signed him for slot value at $3,286,700 two days later. PERSON got off to a strong start in the LOCATION only to have his pro debut come to an abrupt end when he tore his ORGANIZATION, medial and lateral meniscus in his right knee during a home-plate collision on July 19, resulting in season-ending surgery for the ORGANIZATION' top pick. With his leverage and bat speed, PERSON has easy pop to all fields. His swing is busier than most scouts would like, but his approach is generally sound and he ranked second among D-I hitters with a program-record 66 walks during the spring.PERSON is a fringy runner out of the batter's box, but he has solid speed once he gets going. Some evaluators think he has a chance to stay in center field, but most believe he's destined for right field, where he could develop into a serious home run threat with average or better tools across the board.",0
"Signed out of GPE back in December 2012, PERSON had been slow to adjust to pro ball, though he was showing signs of life as a 19-year-old in the short-season LOCATION in 2015.PERSON has shown a pretty good approach at the plate from the left side, and it has started to translate into performance. He's not afraid to work counts or to take walks, and he's added some strength, which has given him more extra-base power and could result in solid home run pop as me matures further. PERSON has good speed and is an instinctive outfielder. He has the skills to play center, but sharing the outfield with draftee PERSON has pushed him to a corner, where his arm plays just fine.PERSON doesn't turn 20 until December, so there's plenty of time to be patient. The tools are all there for him to be solid big league outfielder in due time.",0
" PERSON's powerful right arm has enticed scouts since his amateur days in the ORGANIZATION. But he has struggled to harness his stuff and will have to sort out his control issues as he advances in the ORGANIZATION. He was making some strides in the ORGANIZATION State League when he was one of two arms sent to the Phillies in the ORGANIZATION Revere trade.PERSON throws his fastball in the low to mid 90s and is capable of touching 98 mph. His slider and changeup both show promise, though both pitches remain inconsistent. PERSON never has thrown many strikes as a professional. His wildness and smaller frame may make him better suited to be a reliever in the long run, and ORGANIZATION moved him to that role in high Class A in 2015.",0
"Announced as a second baseman when the ORGANIZATION drafted him, and deployed primarily in left field as a pro, PERSON's stiffness and immobility will likely limit him to first base, where he played in college. He has sufficient power to profile there but there have been questions about the contact since high school. He clubbed 22 homers in 2018, mostly at Hi-A, and will force some re-evaluation if he has a big year at Double-A. For now, he projects as a bench bat with limited defensive flexibility.",0
" PERSON PERSON got most of the buzz as the toolsiest high school outfielder in the 2012 Draft class, but PERSON wasn't far behind. The GPE prepster, who starred for ORGANIZATION on numerous occasions, has excellent bat speed and can drive the ball to all fields. While he's not the biggest guy on the field, he has surprising pop and should grow into decent power down the road. PERSON is an excellent defensive center fielder with good range and a strong arm. Beyond his physical skills, PERSON's top tools are his instincts and his makeup, both of which are off the charts and allow his already-impressive abilities to play up even more.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"The ORGANIZATION landed PERSON at the outset of the 2014-15 international period, signing him one day after they had inked current top prospect PERSON. The right-hander pitched well in his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION to earn a promotion to the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League in late July, and he continued to make progress in the GPE League last season before wearing down physically late in the year.Though he's an undersized right-hander, PERSON's athleticism and fast arm generate a fastball that can reach 95-96 mph, though he typically operates in the low 90s. His heater has better movement -- sinking action, in particular -- in that range, though at times it does linger up in the zone. PERSON's secondaries lag well behind his fastball, but he does have some feel for a breaking ball, and will flash an average changeup.PERSON's walk rate jumped last season because he struggled to locate his heater, and it also made him vulnerable to the home run ball. His athletic frame and clean, repeatable delivery portends improvement in that regard, and club officials believe he's poised to take a step forward in 2017.",1
"The best college left-hander since PERSON, PERSON entered 2014 as the favorite to go No. 1 overall in the First-Year Player Draft after leading PERSON State to its first PERSON Series berth in 45 years and topping ORGANIZATION Division I in strikeouts the year before. PERSON didn't dominate as much as expected, and he lasted until the third pick, where the FACILITY gave him a $6,582,000 bonus -- the largest in franchise history and the largest ever for a lefty.PERSON's best pitch is a true wipeout slider that usually arrives in the mid-80s and probably could abuse big league hitters right now. He relied on it too heavily during his junior season, which cost him some fastball velocity. PERSON operated in the low 90s for much of the spring, but he has shown the ability to reach 97 mph.PERSON's changeup regressed some, as well, but it can overmatch hitters when it's at its best. Once he stops using his slider too much, his fastball, changeup and command are all expected to improve. Add in a strong frame built for durability, and PERSON could be a future No. 1 starter.",1
" Arguably the best right-handed hitter on the market, GPE has tons of raw power, a short stroke and good balance at the plate.He's known for spraying line drives all over the field, but he also has home run power, especially to his pull side. GPE has impressed scouts with his ability to square the ball up and make hard contact every time he gets into the batter's box. However, some wonder if the teen has a true position on defense. For now, GPE is at third base, but that could change in the future.A regular in the ORGANIZATION, GPE was a standout at the ORGANIZATION in January, notching four hits in seven at-bats. One of the youngest players on the market, GPE won't be able to sign until he turns 16 on Aug. 9. Scouts like his makeup, aggressive nature and approach to the game.",0
"GPE has done nothing but relieve in his three years at ORGANIZATION, and each year he's gotten better while taking on more responsibility. He took a nice step forward as a sophomore setup man, then was absolutely dominant during an All-Star Cape Cod League performance, where he didn't give up a run over 12 appearances. He used that as a springboard to become one of the best college closers in the nation and make a run at the school's single-season saves record.GPE is the prototypical power short reliever and his stuff will play at the next level. He'll throw both a two-seam and four-seam fastball, the former thrown 92-94 mph with good sink and the latter sitting 95-98 mph consistently. He does have a tendency to rush to the plate, which forces him to get on the side of his slider. Once he learns to stay back consistently and stay on top of the hard breaking ball, it should be a plus out pitch for him.The right-hander has struggled with finding the strike zone in the past, but has lowered his walk rate each year and has been going right after hitters in his junior season. He could be the first pure reliever taken in the ORGANIZATION and has the chance to pitch late in games in a big league bullpen in the future.",0
" The ORGANIZATION went over slot to sign PERSON away from the ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION in 2010, and they liked his stuff and pitchability enough to send the ORGANIZATION high school product to full-season ball in his first full professional season. He rebounded from a disappointing 2012 to reach Double-A in 2013 and lead all ORGANIZATION PERSON with 160 strikeouts. He was then dealt to GPE in December as part of the ORGANIZATION' package for PERSON. While PERSON doesn't have the highest ceiling, he projects as a pitchability lefty who can make a living in the back of a big league rotation. He still needs to tighten his command but projects to have average control in the future. His average fastball has good sink to it, and he'll show an average sinking changeup and slider that has occasional bite.",1
"PERSON was a tough sign out of an ORGANIZATION high school in 2014 due to a ORGANIZATION commitment and the ORGANIZATION made a significant offer that came up just short, but they got their man with the 5th overall pick in 2017 after a dominating three year career in GPE. PERSON had a rocky start in 2017, finding his arm slot weeks before the draft when he would take grounders at shortstop and found his natural slot was lower than where he'd been pitching. He pitched 95-99 mph for the first half of a start against Arkansas a few weeks later and hasn't looked back since; he likely won't spend long in the minor leagues and should join the ORGANIZATION young pitching in the big leagues at some point in 2018.",1
"Known as a defense-first catcher out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE, GPE was having a surprise season offensively during his 2014 pro debut when a broken hamate bone ended his season in the ORGANIZATION at the end of July. He struggled during his first full season, hitting just .183 in the ORGANIZATION State League, but rebounded at the start of 2016 back with GPE, earning a June promotion to Double-A.It's surprising enough to see GPE as a good defender, given his 6-foot-6 frame. He has a solid throwing arm and receives well, with agility in his lanky frame. His ability to swing the bat may shock even more people, especially after a college career that saw him hit just .278. But GPE is capable of having a short swing, especially for his size, and he made some adjustments heading into 2016. There is some raw power for him to tap into.GPE needs to swing the bat well over the course of a full season to suggest that he can do it long-term. If he can do that, he has the chance to be a big league regular, with a backup role perhaps more realistic.",0
"When the A's acquired PERSON in December 2011 as a part of the trade that sent PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION, he had just celebrated his 19th birthday and was coming off an impressive stateside debut. He emerged as one of GPE's better pitching prospects in 2013 and moved up to Double-A the following year, only to have his season all but wiped out by PERSON surgery in May. He returned to the mound last June at ORGANIZATION A Advanced GPE, but was held to a strict 60-pitch/four-inning limit as he continued to work his way back from surgery.PERSON's velocity was down during his initial starts at GPE, but, by the end of the season, the right-hander was back sitting in the 92-95 mph range and bumping 96 with his fastball. His changeup has above-average potential and complements his fastball well, and he'll also mix in a show-me curveball. His slider was inconsistent but showed the makings of becoming a third average-or-better offering up until he blew out his elbow. The A's didn't have him throw it in 2015, though, as they instead emphasized building up arm strength and regaining feel. Throwing strikes has never been a problem for PERSON, who has walked just 1.9 batters per nine innings as a professional.PERSON returned to PERSON in 2016 but was inconsistent across his starts for GPE. He began to show signs of finally turning the corner in late July, which is when the A's promoted him to Triple-A. The right-hander had made significant strides in the year before his injury, and if he's able to fully recapture that ability and develop a more consistent breaking ball, he has a chance to become a solid Major League starter.",1
"GPE (GPE) PERSON hasn't had a player drafted since the ORGANIZATION selected PERSON seventh overall in 2004. That will change this June, as GPE figures to go in the second or third round. His present stuff is solid, and scouts love his projectability, makeup and bloodlines.GPE already throws 88-92 mph, and he's still filling out his lanky 6-foot-5 frame, with his 18th birthday a week before the GPE. His fastball is more notable for its angle than its life. He has a feel for spinning the ball but needs to add more power to his curve. He also could use more deceptive arm speed with his changeup, though it has some promising fade.GPE has a loose arm that works well, and he could have three solid or better pitches once he gets stronger and maintains a consistent arm slot. His father PERSON starred at ORGANIZATION, and his uncle PERSON was an All-America pitcher at ORGANIZATION, where PERSON has committed.",0
"PERSON honored his commitment to GPE rather than sign with the ORGANIZATION out of high school as a 28th-round pick in 2014. Three years later, after a huge step forward during his junior season that included a 20-strikeout performance, PERSON landed in the first round, going to the ORGANIZATION with the ORGANIZATION. 20 overall pick, and signed for full pick value. After having his pro debut shortened by an ingrown toe nail and then beginning his first full season behind schedule due to a minor knee injury, PERSON breezed through the LOCATION, posting a 1.82 ERA in nine starts at ORGANIZATION A Columbia before advancing to the ORGANIZATION A Advanced PERSON League.PERSON's fastball is average in terms of velocity, as he'll sit at 89-91 mph and touch 93, but few starters in the Minors can sink and command it as well as he does. Logging 127 1/3 innings in his first full season, PERSON yielded only two home runs (0.14 HR/9) and posted the third-best ground-ball rate (64.5%) in the Minors among qualified pitchers. He combines his heater with an above-average slider that nets him whiffs as an out pitch, while his changeup, which flashes above-average, gives him a weapon against right-handed hitters. He fills out his four-pitch mix with a fringy curveball that he can throw for a strike.Despite a lower arm slot from his 6-foot-6 frame, PERSON has demonstrated outstanding control of all his pitches, even if he can stand to refine his overall command some. Average bat-missing ability and a knack for inducing weak, ground-ball contact points to more of a floor than a ceiling for PERSON, but it might not take him that long to reach his potential as a ORGANIZATION. 3 or 4 starter.",0

ORGANIZATION has a thin frame and has room to add muscle, but he flashes quick hands and wrists, allowing him to take the proper angle to the ball at the plate. His upside has scouts intrigued.",0
"The FACILITY likely landed 40 percent of their future rotation with their first two picks in the 2014 Draft. No. 3 overall pick PERSON needed just 34 2/3 Minor League innings before he was ready for the Majors, while second-rounder PERSON could prove to be an outright steal after signing for $1,282,700 as the 44th overall pick. He has lived up to his reputation as one of the most athletic, projectable and polished pitchers from the 2014 high school crop.Though PERSON worked with a 92-96 mph fastball and flashed a plus slider as a prep senior, his stuff hasn't been as sharp as he has adjusted to the rigors of a full pro season. He pitched mostly at 88-92 mph and had a less devastating slider, though his feel for those pitches remained intact. He also has the makings of an average curveball and changeup.PERSON has posted a 155-22 K-BB ratio in his first two years as a pro, a testament to the ease with which he repeats his loose, effortless delivery at will. A former three-sport star in high school, he should add more power to his pitches once he adds strength to his slender frame. He has both a high ceiling and a high floor, and his strong makeup should allow him to make the most of his ability.",0
"PERSON was a max-effort 94-97 in college, had scattershot fastball command, and a plus changeup. His velo is down and neither of his two breaking balls has great movement. We think he's a Tyler Clippard-style changeup reliever so long as the velocity returns.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have been fairly aggressive in pushing PERSON, who they signed in August 2010, sending him to the advanced short-season LOCATION for his GPE debut in 2012 and then to the full-season ORGANIZATION in 2013. The ORGANIZATION felt the teenager could handle the assignments largely because of his defense. He flashes an outstanding glove and uses his excellent speed to have good range. He runs well on the basepaths, too, and should be a base-stealing threat. He's never going to hit for much power, but the switch-hitter has shown an ability to make consistent contact.",1
"Since signing with the ORGANIZATION out of the ORGANIZATION in 2009, PERSON made slow and steady progress at the lower levels of GPE's system. After a breakout 2014 with PERSON that was highlighted by a trip to the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON, he was traded to the ORGANIZATION in December in the deal that sent PERSON and PERSON to GPE.PERSON stands out because of his combination of upside and ceiling with feel for pitching. He has a three-pitch mix. PERSON's fastball is a power sinker that sits in the 91-94 mph zone. His best secondary offering is his above-average changeup, and he has an advanced feel for the offspeed pitch already. PERSON's slider is a work in progress, thrown at 81-84 mph, but it's still a little too slurvy at the moment. He's generally been a strike-thrower throughout his brief PERSON career. PERSON still remains somewhat raw, but his powerful arm should help him start to move through the ORGANIZATION faster as he builds on his success.",0
" It looked for a while in 2016, two years after he was taken in the second round of the Draft out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks and signed away from his GPE commitment, that PERSON's career was in trouble. He struggled so much in his full-season debut that the ORGANIZATION removed him from competitive pitching and sent him back to their Minor League complex in GPE to start over. A year after that, in a story of resiliency, PERSON pitched his way from the ORGANIZATION up to the GPE League by season's end. PERSON made a living in 2017 getting hitters to beat his low-90s two-seamer into the ground. His curve can be at least above-average; it's a weapon he needs to commit to using as an out pitch more frequently in the future. That's especially important because he's yet to develop a consistent feel for a third pitch. While the progress has been encouraging, the right-hander will have to improve his control and command as he moves forward, issuing too many walks for a pitcher who doesn't miss a ton of bats. The ORGANIZATION will let PERSON continue to start in 2018 and he's plenty young enough to continue to improve. There may come a time, however, when the organization will want to see what the sinker-curve combination looks like coming out of the bullpen.",0
"The younger brother of big leaguer PERSON, PERSON is an entirely different style of player. PERSON is a speedy utility infielder while PERSON's tools fit the classic profile of a right fielder. To fill that role in the big leagues, he'll have a shake off a 2014 season in which he set career lows with a .230/.302/.309 performance in Double-A.PERSON has the bat speed, strength and hand-eye coordination to hit for average and power. He has yet to turn on many pitches and excels at hitting the ball the other way, so he has stood out more as a hitter than a slugger in the ORGANIZATION. He got in trouble trying to hit home runs last year instead of letting his power develop naturally, which the ORGANIZATION believe will happen once he does a better job of incorporating his lower half in his swing.If he gets back on track offensively, PERSON could have average or better tools across the board. He's an average runner and a solid defender in right field, where he showcases a plus arm.",1
"PERSON battled the strike zone in two years at ORGANIZATION before boosting his stock by leading the ORGANIZATION with 10 saves and reaching 98 mph with his fastball during the summer of 2016. He decided to transfer to ORGANIZATION II power PERSON, where he continued to struggle to harness his power arsenal. That continued after the ORGANIZATION signed him for $417,200 in the fourth round last June.PERSON usually works with a 94-96 mph fastball that features armside run as a reliever and with a little less velocity when he starts. He also can miss bats with a pair of breaking balls, a low-80s curveball with good depth and an upper-80s slider/cutter, though he can't always land them in the strike zone. He also uses a changeup that might give him a decent offspeed pitch if he uses it more often.Though PERSON drafted PERSON with the idea of trying to develop him as a starter, club officials concede that his never-ending search for command means he'll likely be a reliever. He has cleaned up his delivery some since high school but it still contains a lot of effort and he has difficulty keeping it in sync. Coming out of the bullpen, he'd have late-inning upside if he could throw enough strikes.",0
"After pitching just 7 2/3 innings as a freshman in 2015, PERSON emerged as the closer for GPE and the GPE collegiate national team last year. He also struck out 11 in a complete-game five-hitter in his lone college start in the ORGANIZATION regional playoffs and some scouts thought he might be able to handle a move to the rotation full-time. The Gamecocks have plenty of pitching depth, however, so they've kept him in the bullpen.PERSON is well equipped to handle the late innings. He operates with a 92-97 mph fastball that reaches 99, and while it doesn't feature a lot of life, he commands it well. He backs it up with a hard slider that peaks at 85 mph with nice bite when it's on, though it gets slurvy at ORGANIZATION has the makings of a changeup, though he doesn't use it much as a reliever and will have to refine it if a pro team decides to deploy him as a starter. Though he has the athleticism to handle a shift to the rotation, that may be less likely to happen after he missed six weeks this spring with a sore arm. When he returned to the mound in mid-April, his fastball sat at 93-97 mph.",0
"After pushing him very quickly at the onset of his pro career, in 2018 the ORGANIZATION throttled down PERSON' development and had him repeat Hi-A. He regressed statistically (his strikeout rate was down, and his walk rate stayed just below average after regressing in 2017) before he succumbed to a June elbow injury that cost him the remainder of his summer. PERSON started throwing harder in 2018 and remains a projectable, athletic 20-year-old with a great arm action and some changeup feel. That's still a lot of good stuff, even though other aspects of his profile have either plateaued or gone backward. We hope the fastball control comes back and think PERSON can pitch at the back of a rotation if it does.",0
"GPE bat-first prospect. PERSON college prospect  who had strong freshman year, down sophomore campaign.",0
"Teams who like college hitters who perform, especially in competitive conferences, will undoubtedly be giving PERSON a long look at ORGANIZATION' Draft-eligible sophomore has certainly raised his stock with his performance at the plate this spring. The outfielder has a smooth swing from the left side of the plate, showing the ability to consistently barrel up balls and make consistently hard contact. Not known for his power previously, the ORGANIZATION native has added some strength and was among the nation's leaders in home runs this season. PERSON has plus speed, which should allow him to be a basestealing threat and stick in center field.PERSON does have some leverage as a sophomore, but most around Little Rock feel he's going to be drafted early enough to forego his junior season at ORGANIZATION.",1
"PERSON didn't pitch as a sophomore at ORGANIZATION (GPE) JC, then transferred to PERSON and set the ORGANIZATION' single-season (19) and career (27) saves records, surpassing current Pirates shortstop PERSON in the latter category. A $1,000 senior sign by the Athletics in the 22nd round of the 2014 Draft, PERSON recorded a 1.37 ERA in his first two years as a pro and saved 27 games in his first full season while reaching Double-A. He reached Triple-A in his first year in the ORGANIZATION' system after being acquired in a trade for PERSON, but he drew a 50-game suspension in the offseason after testing positive for a stimulant.PERSON may be small (5-foot-10, 170 pounds) and possess below-average fastball velocity, but he is effective because he's extremely deceptive, mixes four pitches and locates them where he wants. His fastball maxes out at 93 mph, but hitters don't punish it because it features good life and he works it to both sides of the plate and down in the strike zone. His best offering is his solid curveball, and he also can get swings and misses with his average slider and changeup.Throwing from a variety of arm slots to keep hitters off-balance, PERSON has dominated left-handers as well as right-handers. He's a good bet to become at least a middle reliever in the big leagues and could ascend to that role in 2016.",1
"PERSON played for the national team in 2011 and '12 as a shortstop, helping PERSON to gold medals each time. But he moved behind the plate this spring at ORGANIZATION and has become one of the ORGANIZATION's most intriguing catching prospects. He isn't especially toolsy, but PERSON plays above his talent level, thanks to his feel for the game. He has a good approach as a hitter and provides gap power but probably won't ever be much of a power hitter. He is still learning behind the plate, but is eager to improve.",1
"Signed as an undrafted free agent out of GPE, PERSON has reached Double-A and performed at each stop, accumulating a 140:26 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 115 pro innings. He's a low slot lefty with below-average velocity, on the surface appearing to be of the ORGANIZATION endangered species. But PERSON can really spin a breaking ball, and has a four-pitch mix that you could argue plays like a six-pitch mix because he likes to vary his arm slot. He could be a non-traditional bullpen mainstay.",0
"After he was unable to accrue playing time at ORGANIZATION, PERSON transferred to GPE and spent 2019 dominating ORGANIZATION hitters. He's a physical beast with some of the best velocity and breaking stuff in the draft, but there are questions about his build, athleticism, and injured hips. Despite lacking a changeup, PERSON has the pitch mix and pitch utility to start. In addition to solid east/west fastball command, he can drop his curveball in the zone for strikes and back foot either of his breaking balls to lefties. Several teams in the eight through 14 range had PERSON in their mix as the draft approached.",0
"PERSON signed for $275,000 in the 2016 signing period and has steadily progressed to be among the best homegrown Latin prospects GPE has, arguably with PERSON and GPE for some observers. There's a shot for average all-around offense, and most see PERSON as a hit-over-power prospect, evident through the high-contact numbers he showed 2018 in the ORGANIZATION, while some see potential above-average power and that PERSON will prioritize over contact down the road. He's also a good enough athlete to stick at third base at the moment, though that may change depending on how his body matures. PERSON was already pretty filled out at 16 and may outgrow third. The offense will dictate his future and there are some exciting elements already present, especially for a lower-bonus prospect who signed just two years ago.",0
"Not long ago, PERSON was an undersized GPE shortstop who would pitch once in a while. The ORGANIZATION liked his athleticism enough to sign him and move him to the mound full-time. He's added a full ten ticks to his fastball over the last two and a half years, and now is not only one of the best on-mound athletes in the minors, but a hard worker and team leader with infectious charisma. PERSON's velocity came as he got in the weight room and added about 25 pounds. He was so dominant during his first few pro starts in the ORGANIZATION that the ORGANIZATION quickly pushed him stateside for the remainder of 2017, then to the ORGANIZATION at age 18 the following year. 
Not only does PERSON have premium arm strength, but he has natural feel for spin, and is a curious learner who quickly actualizes instruction on the mound. He has already begun to vary the cadence of his delivery to mess with hitters' timing, and has mapped aspects of ORGANIZATION's delivery to his own, just to see if it works for him. He's still a little too confident with his breaking ball in the zone, but it's hard not to expect an athlete with work habits like these (PERSON has already learned and is fluent in GPE) to get better at everything. You can go nuts projecting on his secondaries and command the same way scouts did with PERSON when he was in high school, and PERSON's breaking stuff is further along than GPE's was at the same age. He likely won't grow into more velo because the frame for that isn't here, but he's already got plenty of heat. Conservatively, PERSON has mid-rotation upside, but how the changeup and breaking ball command develop matter because that's where there's room for significant growth.",0
" The ORGANIZATION isn't known as a huge baseball conference, but it's had its fair share of GPE prospects, most of them pitchers. PERSON has the chance to be just as good as guys like PERSON, PERSON or PERSON' best attribute might be his arm strength, with the ability to get his fastball up into the mid 90s, though it plays better when he sits in the 92-93 mph range. He has plus action on his curve, though he has trouble commanding it at times. PERSON also throws a cutter-type pitch and a changeup, both of which are below average currently.PERSON' ability to improve his offspeed stuff and his overall command will dictate whether he can start long-term. The team that takes him will likely send him out as a starter, knowing he has the power arsenal that would work well in short relief.",0
"PERSON was identified as a potential high first round pick as a high school underclassman, showing mid-90's velocity and a long, lanky, athletic frame in tournaments. He held serve as an elite arm over the next few years, going 4th overall in 2016 and continuing to show some of the best stuff on the planet: two 70's and two 60's on some days. The issues are with just about everything else I haven't mentioned, as PERSON doesn't have much deception, he has too much effort/head whack in his delivery, his fastball doesn't have much life and he may generally just throw too hard to learn the finesse aspects of being a starting pitcher. His walk rates and contact allowed are worrisome, but the stuff and athleticism are still top of the scale, so the upside remains sky high, but scouts are getting less enthusiastic.",0
"Based on raw stuff, PERSON shouldn't have even been available to PERSON at ORGANIZATION. 29 in the 2013 Draft. Thanks to offseason hip surgery, the club had to wait to see if he can be a Draft steal, though he returned in May, and he earned a promotion in July.The Arkansas right-hander has a huge arm, one that fires well-above-average fastballs, a pair of breaking balls and a changeup. At some point, he might combine the breaking balls, with his slider a better option than his curve and the changeup being a clear fourth option. There are delivery issues to iron out, and the Rays are hopeful that the reps he got in rehab will help smooth some of them out.PERSON didn't throw a competitive pitch until May. PERSON thinks he can start, but the fact that his big arm would play well in the bullpen doesn't hurt.",0
"Because he comes from a tiny town -- PERSON, GPE, which has a population of 2,600 -- and didn't pitch on the showcase circuit last summer, PERSON was relatively unknown before he impressed scouts with his velocity and projectability at ORGANIZATION's World Wood Bat Association World Championship last October. He has continued to raise his profile this spring and could be the second high school player drafted from GPE, behind only potential No. 1 overall pick PERSON's best pitch is a hard sinker that runs from 90-94 mph and could get quicker as he fills out his frame. His slider has improved during his senior season, and though it lacks some consistency, it has late bite and could become a plus pitch in the future. He also demonstrates feel for his changeup, though he doesn't have to use it much.The PERSON recruit is getting better at repeating his mechanics and commanding his pitches. If he continues to develop like he has in the past year, PERSON eventually could become a frontline starter in the big leagues.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in 2007, PERSON spent his first five pro seasons and part of a sixth in GPE ball. After finally reaching Triple-A in late April, he cracked the ORGANIZATION' 40-man roster in August with his first callup to the big leagues.Though PERSON has spent much of his ORGANIZATION career as a starter, he has a brighter future as a reliever. He usually works at 92-95 mph as part of a rotation, and he's reached 99 coming out of the bullpen. PERSON' No. 2 pitch is a hard cutter/slider that pushes the upper 80s.PERSON has funky mechanics that often hamper his control and command. He shows some aptitude for a changeup and often throws it too hard, and he tips off his curveball by slowing down his delivery. PERSON might be better off by shifting to relief and focusing on his two best pitches.",0
"  PERSON had an illustrious career at ORGANIZATION, earning LOCATION Freshman of the Year honors in 2011 and ORGANIZATION of the Year honors in '13, making him the third player in conference history to win both awards. Despite his success, questions remained about PERSON's upside as a professional because of his size.PERSON has done his best to put those questions to rest since the ORGANIZATION picked him in the fifth round in 2013. While showing the kind of offensive skill set that makes him well suited for the top of the order, he reached Triple-A two months into his first second full professional season. With PERSON rapidly advancing in the ORGANIZATION, and PERSON manning second base in GPE, the ORGANIZATION are reintroducing PERSON to the outfield, where he began his college career. His speed, makeup and versatility should help him as he tries to break through to the ORGANIZATION in coming years.",0
"PERSON mostly played shortstop in GPE, but the ORGANIZATION liked his potential behind the plate and moved him there as soon as they signed him for $1.3 million in 2012. Many of GPE's top catching prospects in recent years have been offense-first players, but PERSON profiles as a solid defender who can contribute with the bat. He'll miss the entire 2015 season after surgery to repair a torn labrum in his shoulder in January, but he'll still be 19 when he returns in 2016.He has a strong arm and has had no problems figuring out the quick footwork and transfer he needs as a catcher, throwing out 41 percent of basestealers in his first two pro seasons. PERSON' receiving is still a work in progress but he has the hands and athleticism to improve in that regard.PERSON has a mature approach at the plate, showing patience and using the whole field. He has a quick bat and should provide double-digit home run power once he gets stronger. He may lack PERSON's potential impact bat but has a better chance of remaining a catcher.",1
"In his two seasons since signing for $300,000 as a GPE defector, PERSON has proven to be one of the best and most disciplined hitters in the GPE system. He doesn't try to do too much and rarely chases pitches out of the strike zone, resulting in one line drive after another.Though PERSON' simple approach has produced little power so far, he's strong and the GPE are confident some extra-base hits will come. There are questions about how much bat speed he has and how much pop it can generate.PERSON has played well at third base and though he has yet to try another position, GPE believes he's versatile enough to handle a utility role if needed. He has average speed and arm strength.",0
"PERSON' strikeout rate doubled in 2017 and was still so low that it would have ranked him in the top 15 among qualified ORGANIZATION hitters. He has sublime feel for contact, adjusting the barrel to where it needs to be, when it needs to be there, and his track record of excellent hitting suggests it's going to continue. PERSON changed his leg kick's tempo in 2017 but didn't produce more fly balls nor power and he doesn't project to. PERSON second basemen need to hit like PERSON or PERSON to profile as above-average regulars but it looks ilke PERSON is going to do that.",1
"A two-sport athlete in college, PERSON has really only been playing baseball full time since 2016, so while he's advanced in age he isn't in experience. With that in mind, PERSON' 20 annual homers despite sky-high strikeout rates are pretty impressive. He has power, he runs well, he throws well. It's a traditional right field profile on its face, just one that is behind the developmental curve and of high risk because of the strikeouts. PERSON has to be added to the 40-man this offseason or risk being Rule 5 eligible, making him a trade candidate if a team likes his physical tools and has the 40-man space to let him simmer at Triple-A for another year or so.",0
"PERSON got white-hot during the Longhorns 2018 postseason run and hit .419/.536/1.000 in the team's eight ORGANIZATION tournament games, boosting his junior-year line to .351/.444/.726 with 24 homers, which ranked second in the country. The ORGANIZATION made him the top pick on Day 2 of the 2018 draft and he finished the year with a strong month and a half at Low-A, often against pitching worse than what he faced in college. 
He has a very pretty left-handed swing and can move the bat head around the zone, but PERSON doesn't always track or diagnose pitches well. He may be a swing-and-miss risk against better pro pitching, but what he does may still be enough at second base, assuming PERSON can stay there. At best, teams think he'll be an inoffensive second baseman, with some projecting PERSON to third base or an outfield corner. One source compared him to current 50 FV prospect PERSON. That type of outcome -- a compact body with power, some issues against breaking stuff, below average defense but at a premium position -- would be a good outcome for a third rounder.",0
"PERSON passed on the opportunity to play tight end at ORGANIZATION out of high school in 2013, instead signing with the ORGANIZATION for $300,000 as a sixth-round Draft pick. He scuffled in GPE ball during his first two pro seasons, but he broke out in a big way during his 2015 full-season debut, hitting .316 with 17 home runs and 33 doubles across the Class A and Class A Advanced levels. The A's took notice of PERSON's performance and made him their key return in the July trade that sent PERSON to GPE. PERSON wasn't with the A's for long, though, as they traded him to PERSON during the offseason in the ORGANIZATION deal.PERSON's calling card will always be his power. The right-handed hitter's combination of strength and bat speed yields effortless raw power, and he keeps his barrel in the zone long enough to drive the ball out of the park the other way. PERSON's approach and plate discipline should continue to improve as he gains experience against better arms, and he makes enough contact to project for an average hit tool.Scouts are divided on whether PERSON can remain behind the plate. He has average arm strength as well as solid catch-and-throw skills, but his blocking and receiving are both raw. PERSON also saw time at first base last season, and his offensive profile would support a move to the position if catching doesn't work out.",1
"If things had gone according to plan, PERSON would have graduated from the prospect rankings in 2017. The native of GPE, GPE, who moved to the ORGANIZATION in order to sign as an international free agent in '12, had hit some stumbling blocks, including a shoulder issue in '15 and a drug suspension in '16, before rebounding to make a big league impact later that year. Poised to establish himself in '17, he instead required PERSON surgery in February and missed the season. He began the '18 season on the 60-day disabled list, worked his way back to GPE Louis only to have his season lost to a torn lat tendon that required surgery in June.When healthy, PERSON has one of the most electric fastballs among all pitching prospects. He easily hits triple digits and sits in the mid-to-upper 90s with ease. That and a plus upper-70s curve would be enough for a bullpen gig, but his 88-90-mph changeup gives him a third above-average offering. The only negative -- beyond the injury bug -- for PERSON has been his command, and he will have to keep his walk rate relatively in check to reach his potential as a top-of-the-rotation starter.PERSON was throwing well again post elbow surgery and was in excellent shape. He'll have to go through another rehab process now to get back to reaching that extremely high ceiling.",1
"PERSON put himself on the map for 2019 as a sophomore the previous year by finishing second on the team in homers, slugging percentage and ORGANIZATION. He raised his profile even more by showing he could put up similar numbers with wood bats, finishing fifth in the ORGANIZATION in batting average and tied for fourth in home runs. While he hasn't replicated that success during his junior season, he was coming on a bit stronger to climb out of his early-season funk.PERSON' power is legitimate, with the ability to drive the ball to all fields with good bat speed, and he showed enough ability to make contact to hit .326 in the Cape over the summer. There is length in his left-handed swing, however, leading to some swing and miss issues at times, including 34 strikeouts in 34 Cape League games. A solid athlete who runs well enough, PERSON has largely stuck to the outfield corners in college though he was seeing time in center field this spring, with most seeing left field as his likely long-term home. PERSON is always a hot commodity, especially from a college left-handed hitter. PERSON is streaky, but his bat speed and natural leverage should entice some teams who covet pop in the early rounds.",0
"It is not enough to say that PERSON is having issues with control. Even pitchers walking guys at a 10% clip or worse face legitimate questions about their ability to start, and sometimes their ability to pitch in the big leagues at all. PERSON is walking more than 30% of the hitters he faces right now, and has been moved to the Low-A bullpen. He simply can't be a big leaguer with this kind of wildness, but his stuff remains incredible, among the best in the minors. 
Through these struggles, PERSON has continued to throw in the upper-90s with one of the harder power curveballs on the planet. He has top of the rotation stuff, but even those in amateur scouting who thought his delivery was too violent to repeat (which would make it tough to start) did not think PERSON's strike-throwing issues would be this much of a problem. We'd still take him ahead of relief-only types in this class because the stuff is so good, teams felt good about his makeup before the draft, and PERSON is still pretty young. With time, he's pretty likely to figure something out, though it's suddenly very likely to be in some kind of bullpen role.",0
"The blockbuster trade that sent PERSON and two other prospects to GPE in exchange for PERSON may seem like ancient history now, but PERSON should be ready for the big league stage. He made his PERSON debut in August 2012, but he missed all of the '13 season after undergoing PERSON surgery that April.When he's healthy, PERSON creates plenty of ground balls, thanks to the heavy sinking action on his low-90s fastball. He also throws a solid changeup and a curveball, giving him three pitches that are PERSON average or better.PERSON is a phenomenal athlete, and he repeats his delivery well, giving him good command. He suffered a setback in his rehab this year, but when he's fully recovered from surgery, he should slide into the ORGANIZATION' rotation.",1
"The ORGANIZATION used their top two picks (both second rounders) in the 2015 ORGANIZATION on two of the best defensive outfielders available, PERSON's PERSON and ORGANIZATION high school product PERSON. Though PERSON was GPE's second choice, he got the highest bonus in its ORGANIZATION crop at $800,000.PERSON uses his plus speed well on the bases and in center field. He gets better reads on balls than most high schoolers and can chase down balls from gap to gap. He has average arm strength, allowing him to play all three outfield positions if needed.PERSON offensive ceiling is something to dream on. The ORGANIZATION knew he was capable of switch-hitting prior to the ORGANIZATION and took him with that in mind, ultimately making him a full-time switch-hitter during instructional league. PERSON sprays line drives across the whole field and has a good concept of the strike zone, so he should hit for average. He also has promising bat speed and could develop average power once he gets stronger.",0
"The scouting industry has come a long way in terms of not looking past undersized players. That works in the favor of a high school hitter like ORGANIZATION, whose name was moving up boards as his he continued to excel this spring.While not the biggest guy in the world -- he's listed at 5-foot-10 -- there is a lot to like in the ORGANIZATION prepster's game. The right-handed hitter has been swinging the bat extremely well, showing the ability to hit for average and power. He's super-athletic with plus run times down the line. One thing he doesn't have is an obvious long-term defensive home. He plays a lot of shortstop now, and he can make steady plays there, but some feel he lacks the actions to stick there at the highest level. He has enough arm to play third and he's looked good in the outfield, where his arm plays up even more, getting some time there last fall.ORGANIZATION gets high marks for his plus instincts and work ethic, having worked very hard to get his body into premium condition. Some compare him to GPE third baseman PERSON, with more speed, and some think the ORGANIZATION commit could go as early as the second round.",0
"Because PERSON topped all ORGANIZATION Division I pitchers with 21 starts in the spring of 2012, PERSON gave him the summer off after signing him as a fifth-round pick. When he made his pro debut last year, he starred, leading the high Class A GPE League in GPE (2.90) and fewest walks per nine innings (1.2).PERSON has an impressive mound presence and feel for pitching, and he also has quality stuff. He goes after hitters and attacks the strike zone with three pitches that each can grade as plus offerings when they're at their best.PERSON throws both a two-seam and a four-seam fastball, getting good sink on the two-seamer and hitting 94 mph with the four-seamer. His changeup features deception and fade, and his slider is a reliable third option. PERSON doesn't beat himself with walks, and he rarely misses up in the strike zone.",0
"With his huge frame and fastball to match, PERSON de PERSON was one of the most imposing high school pitchers in the 2014 PERSON. He also was raw and coming off PERSON surgery the year before, so he wound up sliding to the 14th round and attending PERSON. He worked just eight innings in 2015 and faced just one batter before requiring nerve transposition surgery in 2016, but he's back lighting up radar guns and climbing PERSON boards this spring.PERSON de PERSON's fastball has an overpowering combination of velocity and life. He operates at 92-96 mph as a starter, tickles 100 in shorter stints and has so much heavy sink that makes it nearly impossible to lift his heater. As he has gotten more work this spring than in the previous four years combined, his curveball has improved and shows signs of becoming a plus pitch.Whether PERSON de PERSON can make it as a starter remains to be seen. His changeup remains in its rudimentary stages, and he still has little history of finding the strike zone or staying healthy. PERSON love his makeup and see closer potential if he winds up in the bullpen.",0
"GPE established himself as an intriguing junior college lefty prospect in 2016 when he put an exclamation point on his collegiate career by striking out 15 in a complete-game victory to give GPE a ORGANIZATION championship shortly before the GPE. The fourth-rounder went on to have a solid pro debut with the ORGANIZATION, then saw all of his stuff tick up as he pitched across two levels of Class A ball during his first full season.GPE looked more like a pure pitchability lefty coming out of GPE, but his improved stuff, along with his command, make him a much better pitching prospect overall. His four-seam fastball was up to 95 mph all year, including his final start of 2017 against PERSON super-prospects PERSON and PERSON, while his sinking 90-93 mph two-seamer generates a lot of weak contact on the ground. Depending on the report, he has as many as four secondary pitches. His changeup and cutter have the chance to be plus pitches, while he has a distinct average slider that is a bit ahead of his curveball. He fills the strike zone with all of them consistently.While he's not the biggest guy in the world, GPE is very athletic and strong and has already shown to be very durable. At first thought to be a back-end starter, the southpaw looks like he could be more of a No. 3 type when all is said and done.",0
"PERSON is the kind of player you typically see near the top of July 2nd bonus lists. HeÃ¢â¬â¢s a 6Ã¢â¬â¢0, lanky shortstop with easy actions and an above average arm with an ability to stick at the position. PERSON ran a 7.01 in the 60 in February a 50 run time on the 20-80 scale, but heÃ¢â¬â¢s the type of kid who will probably gain a step in the next few years; PERSON is an example of similar prospect who gained a couple steps after he signed. PERSON ran a 6.76 for me in October, so 55 speed is clearly in the tank already.

PERSON flashes average raw power that may even be a tick better than that depending how his body develops and he flashes some ability to show that tool in games. In the first half of the video, from last month, PERSON was just okay offensively, getting off balance and swinging and missing more than expected. In the second half of the video, from October, PERSON is more relaxed with better timing. While his mechanics still arenÃ¢â¬â¢t perfect, his feel for hitting took over when his hitting actions were more compact. This isnÃ¢â¬â¢t to say that PERSON is trending down, just pointing out how one bad event could change a scoutÃ¢â¬â¢s projection if he didnÃ¢â¬â¢t have history with the player. This type of variance is common with young players and is fixable.

PERSON is widely believed to have a deal with the ORGANIZATION for $4.0 million, which I believe would be the highest July 2nd bonus of all-time for a shortstop.",0
"Originally drafted out of high school by the ORGANIZATION in the fifth round in 2011, PERSON opted to honor his commitment to ORGANIZATION rather than begin his pro career. Though he went on to have an unspectacular college career that involved injury and role changes, the ORGANIZATION liked his untapped potential for those very same reasons, and they made him their 11th round pick in 2014. After a solid full-season debut, PERSON returned to the ORGANIZATION State League in 2016 and garnered All-Star honors before moving up to Double-A Biloxi in mid-May.After touching 97 mph out of the bullpen in college, PERSON has operated consistently in the low 90s as a starter in pro ball. The pitch has a ton of late-sinking action that plays up because of the downhill plane he creates with his 6-foot-4 frame, and the combination gives him the chance to be a big-time ground-ball artist once developed. Both his slider and changeup have the chance to be at least PERSON average offerings, with the offspeed pitch perhaps a touch ahead of the breaking ball. PERSON battled control and command problems at ORGANIZATION, where he allowed more than five walks per-nine-innings in his career, but the right-hander has proven to be a more consistent strike-thrower as a pro. The ORGANIZATION believe he'll be able to refine his command enough to remain a starter. If not, PERSON has the stuff and strong ground-ball rates to get outs coming out of the bullpen.",1
"  The GPE have used PERSON as a reliever since drafting him out of GPE in the 18th round in 2011. Serving as the closer at ORGANIZATION in 2014, he saved 15 games, the fifth most in the LOCATION League.PERSON primarily attacks hitters with his sinker-slider combination. His fastball sits in the low-90s, occasionally touching as high as 96 mph. At its best, his slider has a hard bite, and he mixes in an occasional changeup against left-handed hitters. He has some crossfire to his delivery, and his control is inconsistent as a result. Even without better command, PERSON could soon carve out a role in the GPE bullpen thanks to his powerful sinker-slider combination.",0
"Your standard high school projection arm with a breaking ball, PERSON is back at Low-A to start 2019. Like most pitchers of this ilk, fastball command and the development of a third pitch stand between PERSON and industry confidence that he's a starter. That stuff hasn't developed just yet, but PERSON is still just 20. If that doesn't happen, he's likely to be a fine reliever.",0
"PERSON PERSON in GPE has had three players taken in the ORGANIZATION over the years, but none earlier than the 21st round, and none have ever reached the big leagues. PERSON should beat his predacessors by plenty, with some late helium this spring as the ORGANIZATION approached.PERSON is big, strong and athletic with some tools to dream on. While he's 6-foot-4, he is a 60 runner on the 20-to-80 scouting scale and maybe even better than that once he's underway. That should help him on the basepaths and gives him solid range while playing shortstop. It's possible he'll outgrow the position, where he has an average, sometimes a tick above, arm, once he physically matures, but he should be able to handle a move to third without a problem and his speed could work from the outfield. At the plate, he has good bat speed, strength and loft to his swing, though he's mostly been a line-drive hitter this year. He's struggled with good breaking stuff at times, but he has shown an ability to make adjustments in the past.PERSON picked up steam with a big performance in front of a lot of eyes, with decision-makers pouring in to see him. He had a definite up arrow next to his name and could see his name go off the board in the top four rounds.Prospect Development PERSON - PERSON",1
"Signed by PERSON at the outset of the 2013-14 international period, PERSON made his Major ORGANIZATION debut four years later as a September callup in '17 after making the jump directly from Double-A. The hard-throwing right-hander logged eight appearances out of the ORGANIZATION' bullpen down the stretch and then made strides in the ORGANIZATION as a starter before going to the ORGANIZATION with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON for PERSON in December. Returning the Majors in 2018, PERSON earned the win in his first ever big league start in late June after a strong first half in Triple-A. PERSON's velocity has increased in the last two years as he's added good strength to his tall and wiry frame. He'll frequently touch triple digits with his fastball and sits consistently in the 95-99 mph range with late movement. He features a pair of breaking balls in a fringy curveball and a hard, mid-80s slider that is an above-average, swing-and-miss pitch at its best. PERSON also will show flashes with an 88-91 mph changeup, a potentially average-or-better offering that plays up due to his fast arm but is lacking in overall consistency.PERSON's control and command both leave much to be desired, but as he keeps adding velocity, he's still learning to harness his stuff. While pinpoint command won't be ever be necessary given his dynamic repertoire, he'll need to pitch down in the zone consistently to be effective as a starter. At the least, PERSON has the weapons to become a dominant closer at the highest level.",1
"PERSON plays the game like a heady college infielder type, but was actually a 16th-round pick of the ORGANIZATION back in 2012 out of the GPE high school ranks. The ORGANIZATION gave PERSON $300,000, with $200K of that counting against their Draft bonus pool in the first year of the new system, because they wanted to sign his offensive potential away from his ORGANIZATION commitment. PERSON improved as he has moved up and had his most productive year with the jump to Double-A in 2015, earning him PERSON of the Year honors. PERSON is a switch-hitter with a good feel for the strike zone. He has the chance to be a Major League average hitter, though the ORGANIZATION feel he could exceed that in time. He has doubles power right now, with more pop in the bat than one might think. Defensively, he's played mostly second and that's his strongest spot, but he's seen time at third and shortstop as well. He's an average runner.The ORGANIZATION like his grinder mentality, his positional versatility and the fact that he's gotten better over time, so they rewarded his work with a spot on the 40-man roster this offseason.",1
"This is a very physical teenager with some of the best present raw power in his signing class and a good chance to play a premium defensive position at catcher. PERSON has a strong, physically mature build that inspires PERSON comparisons. He has excellent lateral mobility despite his size, and his receiving was alright, but not great, when he caught pro-quality stuff at showcases. 
He checks all the other beloved catcher skillset boxes: PERSON is poised and engaged with his pitchers, he has a great arm, he looks built to meet the position's physical demands, and makes an attempt to frame pitches when he can. There's a chance he outgrows the position but he's deceptively athletic for his size, and we'd call it unlikely. There's not as much room for power projection here as there is for most others this age, but there's enough to profile at catcher. PERSON's approach is geared for well-timed, pull-side gap contact. He's a potential regular who'll likely spend his first pro season in GPE, as he's too physical for the ORGANIZATION.",0
" PERSON was the top college senior in the GPE class and, coming out of a program like PERSON, the hope would be that he could move through a system quickly. The ORGANIZATION must agree, as they sent him straight to the Class A Advanced PERSON for his summer debut. PERSON makes consistent hard contact, spraying the ball to all fields. The left-handed hitter uses his speed well with an Ichiro-like swing, helping his home-to-first times, and he's a legitimate basestealing threat, even if his overall speed is more solid average to a slight tick above. PERSON's speed should allow him to stay in center field, and he has a solid arm to boot. It's unclear just what kind of role he'll have as a big leaguer, but few doubt he'll get there fairly quickly.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",0
"GPE potential from a strong, mature frame is what makes PERSON a Draft prospect. Whether a team can entice him away from his commitment to the ORGANIZATION of GPE remains to be seen.PERSON is one of those high school bats who is more power than hit tool right now. He has a ton of pop, especially to the pull side, with an easy swing that features a little bit of an uppercut to generate that power. He can get a little pull-happy at times, hurting his overall ability to make consistent hard contact. He fits in a corner outfield spot, with fringy speed, though he's a solid defender. His arm might best be suited for left field when all is said and done.GPE-hitting corner outfielders will always draw interest, but it might take a team selecting PERSON fairly early on to lure him from playing for the Gators in 2016.",0
"Pitching under the glare of immense expectations, PERSON lived up to them when he returned to Stanford for his senior year rather than sign with the Pirates in 2012, allowing him to be the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick of the Astros a year later. He's struggled to live up to them since, showing glimpses but not putting up the numbers people thought they'd see. ORGANIZATIONw courtesy of the ORGANIZATION trade, it seemed like the change of scenery might be just what the doctor ordered. Instead, he was ordered to the doctor and he was shut down for the year in late June when he needed bone spurs removed from his right elbow.Before the injury, PERSON continued to be enigmatic. His pure stuff was still plenty good, with a fastball in the mid-90s, maintaining his velocity deep into starts. Both his slider and his changeup can be outstanding weapons, with his breaking ball acting as an out pitch at times. His walk rate went up in 2015, but he's generally around the plate, though command within the zone can be an issue for the big right-hander.PERSON will once again try to wipe the slate clean and start over with the Phillies in 2017. He still has the tools to be a successful big league starter, but the clock is certainly ticking.",0
"GPE has lots of natural loft in his swing and his frame has significant projection so there's a chacne he grows into huge raw power. He's likely to move to a corner outfield spot and here are questions about how much he's going to hit because of how overmatched he looked at times last summer against elite pitching, but he's hitting more this spring. ",0
" PERSON was one of the best two-way college players during his career at ORGANIZATION, where he served as the ORGANIZATION ace and first baseman. As a junior, he led the country with 23 home runs and went 12-2 with a 2.09 ERA on the mound. His prolific play in both facets of the game helped him win the 2014 ORGANIZATION as the best amateur player in the country.At one time, scouts preferred PERSON as a pitcher. But he has the type of left-handed power that is difficult to find, and the ORGANIZATION have made him a full-time first baseman. While power is his best tool, PERSON is more than just a masher. He made significant strides as a hitter in college and can consistently square balls up without sacrificing power. PERSON doesn't run well enough to play a position other than first base, but he has a strong arm and is a capable defender.",1
" A prospect since his high school days in GPE, PERSON was up and down during his three years at ORGANIZATION, though he did settle into the rotation as a junior and became the Commodoresâ most reliable starter. He kept that up during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, with an ERA that would have been best in the rookie-level circuit had he thrown enough innings to qualify. He still managed to top the league in strikeouts, thanks to his 13.3 K/9 ratio. His fastball sits in the low-to-mid 90s. He has a slider and a changeup, with the former showing glimpses of being an out pitch, and the latter being a work in progress. Heâs had command and control issues in the past, and those will be important to limit as he moves up the organizational ladder.",0
"The nephew of former ORGANIZATION All-Star Edgardo Alfonzo, PERSON has some of his uncle's natural hitting ability. He batted .333 in each of his two years in GPE ball, finishing second in the ORGANIZATION League batting race in his GPE debut, and continued to hit for average as a 19-year-old in low Class A.PERSON has a knack for making consistent hard contact, though his swing is geared more to line drives than power. One of the better pure bats in the ORGANIZATION system, he could be a future .275 hitter with 10-12 homers per year. He does a good job of making contact, though he draws walks infrequently as well. After playing mostly shortstop in 2013, PERSON saw most of his time at second base while playing alongside PERSON at LOCATION. PERSON may get more action at short after PERSON sent PERSON to PERSON in the PERSON trade, and his future destination may be third base -- just like his uncle. He's a fringy runner who's more reliable than flashy in the field.",0
"PERSON powered GPE to its first PERSON Series appearance and first outright Big Ten Conference regular-season championship since 1932 last year, slugging a school-record 18 homers and ranking third in ORGANIZATION Division I in that category. Undrafted and relatively unknown coming out of an Ohio high school, he has since established himself as the premier power hitter in the 2014 college PERSON class. He offers lots of strength and bat speed from the left side of the plate, and he's not a one-dimensional hitter either. PERSON controls the strike zone well and repeatedly barrels balls, so he should hit for a high average as well. His offensive ability could make him a star as a catcher -- provided that he can stay behind the plate. While he moves well for his size, his throwing and receiving both grade as below average and could prompt a move to the outfield, where he has seen time for the ORGANIZATION.",1
"It can sometimes be difficult for a ORGANIZATION II player to get noticed. That was not a problem for PERSON, though, as he put himself on the map with an All-Star season in the ORGANIZATION last summer and then continued to dominate in the spring, going 12-2 with eight complete games and three shutouts in 15 starts to help PERSON advance to the ORGANIZATION II Championship Tournament. One of 10 finalists for the PERSON, presented annually to the nation's top ORGANIZATION II pitcher, PERSON signed for $250,000 after the ORGANIZATION selected him in the sixth round.PERSON is all about command, one who walked just 13 and struck out 115 in 107 2/3 innings during his regular season last spring. The right-hander's fastball sits right around 90 mph but plays up thanks to his ability to move it to all quadrants of the zone. His slider is his best offering, thrown with short, late biting action, though it's not a huge strikeout pitch for him. His fringy curve is used more as a get-me-over pitch for strike one or as a chase pitch out of the zone with two strikes. He has feel for a changeup, but doesn't use it much.While PERSON has outstanding arm action and repeats his delivery well, a general lack of movement has some thinking he might end up in long relief. However, the ORGANIZATION will give him every opportunity as a starter, with the hope that he can develop into a solid back-of-the-rotation piece.",0
"PERSON was PERSON GPEâs leadoff hitter during the 2017 WBC (he hit two homers and a double in six at-bats) and spent 2015-'17 crushing the ORGANIZATION. He signed with GPE in November 2017, and was hot the following April at Double-A, but then missed three and a half months with an abdominal strain. He only played in 24 games at Double-A, then had 62 extra plate appearances in the ORGANIZATION. In GPE, PERSON looked pretty good. Heâs a stocky and strong 5-foot-6, and he has average, all-fields power. He hit two full-extension, opposite field shots during the fall, including one that got out just left of center field at FACILITY in GPE. Heâs patient and makes good decisions at the plate. Heâs also fine at second base (below-average arm, below-average runner, above-average athlete, average hands) and played a lot of other positions while in GPE. Heâll either need to be viable at other positions or just hit enough to play second base every day. It appears he has a chance to do the latter. 
PERSON acquired him for fringe 40-man relief depth in the offseason. PERSON presents rare 40-man flexibility because he's arguably ready to contribute to a big league lineup right now, but because of how recently he signed, he doesn't have to occupy a 40-man spot until the ORGANIZATION need him on the active roster. They are logjammed at second base at the moment, and haven't asked PERSON to play anywhere else yet. For now, he's just a great depth option behind PERSON and PERSON, but if a rash of injuries or trades press PERSON into action, he might be quite good.",0
Smaller-framed middile infielder with plus defensive hands and actions. Could be contact/glove oriented regular if hit tool would can carry him there.,1
"Long considered the best player in the world not affiliated with a Major League organization, PERSON sparked interest from virtually every club when he announced his intention to come to the GPE for the 2018 season. He made the decision despite changes in the ORGANIZATION Agreement that will limit his bonus to no more than $3.53 million; under the old ORGANIZATION, he likely would have commanded a contract worth more than $200 million. Known as the ORGANIZATION of GPE, PERSON is a two-way star who appears determined to both hit and pitch in the big leagues and is expected to make that a stipulation of signing with a team. Though he was limited in 2017 by a right ankle injury that required surgery in October, he was GPE's ORGANIZATION MVP when fully healthy the year before. In 2016, he went 10-4 with a 1.86 ORGANIZATION and 174 strikeouts in 140 innings while batting .322/.416/.588 with 22 homers in 104 games. He took many by surprise when he announced he had chosen the ORGANIZATION to sign with in December.The scouting reports on PERSON as a pitcher almost seem too good to be true. He threw the fastest recorded pitch in GPE history (102.5 mph in 2016), sits in the upper 90s with late finish on his heater and maintains premium velocity into the late innings. Both his diving splitter, which reaches the low 90s, and his hard slider, which climbs into the high 80s, can be plus-plus pitches at their best. He also employs a curveball and a changeup that are at least average. Though he has an athletic frame and repeatable delivery, his walk rate (3.3 per nine innings) was ordinary in GPE.While the consensus among scouts is that PERSON has more upside as a pitcher, he also has the tools to be a star as a hitter. He has top-of-the-scale raw power and launches tape-measure shots with ease from the left side of the plate. He struck out in 27 percent of his plate appearances in GPE, so he doesn't project as a .300 hitter, but he could bat .270 with 30-plus homers per year. He's also a well-above-average runner, though his speed has yet to translate into stolen bases. He has a cannon arm and should be at least an average defender in right field. Signing with an ORGANIZATION team affords him the ability to DH, which will allow him to get more at-bats and conserve energy for pitching.",1
"PERSON was a raw, toolsy catcher when he was a high schooler in GPE. The level of competition he faced and opposing pitchers' predilection to pitching around him made it difficult for teams to scout PERSON and he wound up in college. He blossomed as an outfielder PERSON, breaking out in the ORGANIZATION in the summer of 2012. PERSON remains relatively raw and toolsy and some scouts wonder if he will be able to adjust to more advanced pitching, though he performed extremely well in the ORGANIZATION as a junior. PERSON creates good bat speed and has plenty of raw power, which he will tap into the more he can improve his approach. PERSON has average speed and is faster once he's under way. He has a strong arm and profiles as a potential five-tool right fielder.",1
"The most talented two-way player in the 2016 Draft, PERSON almost certainly will be drafted in the first round as a position player. Nevertheless, there are scouts who think he may be the best high school arm to come out of GPE since PERSON went sixth overall to the ORGANIZATION in 2009. The state's Gatorade player of the year, he led PERSON (ORGANIZATION) to the GPE 6-A finals.It's hard to ignore what PERSON brings to the table as a position player. He can be streaky at the plate but his quick, controlled left-handed swing and the leverage in his long frame produce considerable raw power. The ORGANIZATION State recruit also has plus speed and arm strength, which should translate into solid defense at third base or in center field.While there's more projection involved when evaluating PERSON as a pitcher, it's easy to dream on an athletic 6-foot-4, 190-pounder with a loose arm and relatively clean delivery. He works at 91-93 mph and can hit the mid-90s with his fastball, which plays up thanks to its downward plane, run and sink. PERSON's three-quarters breaking ball lacks consistency, but it has the makings of a solid slider, and he has some feel for a sinking changeup that gets too firm at times.",0
"GPE is large for shortstop but is a plus runner with an above average arm and should stay there for a while. If anything is going to kick him over to third, it's a lack of flexibility and agility. He has above average raw pull power projection and, if he can get to some of it and stay at short, he could play every day.",1
"PERSON entered the 2012 season as a candidate to go No. 1 overall in the draft, but a slump dropped him to the ORGANIZATION at the 24th pick. As a rare college shortstop talented enough to play there in the big leagues, he commanded a $2.05 million bonus. He has played as advertised in pro ball, shining with his glove while showing inconsistency with his bat.PERSON has all the tools and instincts necessary to win a ORGANIZATION at shortstop. He has smooth actions, reads balls off the bat well, has range to both sides and can make any throw from any angle. He's reliable, too, making just 27 errors in 249 games during his first three pro seasons.His bat remains a question mark after PERSON followed a .291/.371/.433 first half in Double-A last year by hitting .210/.260/.285 in Triple-A. While he'll probably hit at the bottom of a big league batting order, he does have some wiry strength for gap power and the patience to draw a few walks. He's a savvy baserunner with average speed.",0
"The ORGANIZATION found three of their best prospects during the 2012-13 international signing period. In addition to right-hander PERSON and outfielder PERSON, they also landed PERSON. He had starred on junior national teams in GPE, and his $425,000 bonus was the most for any player from his nation that summer.PERSON has an advanced gameplan at the plate for a teenager, focusing on making contact and drilling line drives to all fields. Once he learns to use his plus speed, he'll be a basestealing threat. PERSON won't be a big part of his game, though he has some strength and will sting the ball into the gaps on occasion.PERSON's defensive tools aren't spectacular, but he gets the job done at shortstop and should be able to stick there. He's an instinctive defender with good hands and enough arm to make the throws required at the position.",1
"GPE seniors have done well with the new Draft rules as teams try to find ways to strategically use their bonus pools. PERSON has the chance to be the first senior to come off the board in 2014.Originally a two-way player who played third base for the ORGANIZATION, PERSON started focusing on pitching only as a junior in 2013. He's really taken off this season, showing a jump in velocity up into the mid 90s with plenty of sink. His slider has greatly improved, flashing as a plus pitch. His changeup is behind the other two, but he has shown some feel for it. The focus on pitching has helped his command, and he's able to pitch to both sides of the plate.There is some effort to his delivery, but not enough to make a team think he can't start. GPE seniors typically are value picks, but PERSON has the chance to go in the early rounds based on his size and stuff alone.",0
"PERSON starred at GPE, setting single-season and career records for wins (13 and 30) and strikeouts (138 and 307), but an early-season slump in 2016 dropped him out of first-round consideration. After the ORGANIZATION saw him strike out 16 in the Big Ten Conference tournament during his final college start, they drafted him in the fifth round and paid him a well above-slot $637,500. He has zoomed through the Minors, reaching Triple-A last August and averaging 9.7 strikeouts per nine innings through his first three pro seasons.PERSON relies heavily on a plus low-80s slider that he also can turn into a mid-80s cutter whenever he wants. His fastball isn't overpowering at 90-94 mph with some run and sink, but he'll bust it inside against right-handers and then sweep sliders and cutters away from them. He can back-foot his slider against left-handers and also hold them in check with his fading changeup.PERSON's low-three-quarters arm slot adds deception and life to his pitches without hampering his ability to throw them for strikes. His control has improved as he has risen through the Minors, enhancing his chances of becoming a durable back-of-the-rotation starter. He made his big league debut in June, initially serving as a multi-inning reliever who lived off his slider.",0
"GPE body and swing, could be high-contact ORGANIZATION with speed",1
"The younger brother of one-time Mariners first-round pick D.J. PERSON, PERSON went in the second round of the 2013 Draft out of his ORGANIZATION high school to the ORGANIZATION. He was sent to the ORGANIZATION in December 2014 as part of the ORGANIZATION trade and had a bit of a breakout offensively in 2016, though a hamate injury forced him out of the start of 2017 and seemed to negate any power gains he had made. He wasn't protected on the ORGANIZATION' 40-man roster last offseason and wasn't taken in the Rule 5 Draft, but did get added to the roster when he made his brief big league debut in May. When the ORGANIZATION designated him for assignment in September, the ORGANIZATION swooped in and claimed him off of waivers.Now 100 percent healthy, PERSON showed a bit more of the 2016 version of him, especially in the second half. That was the year he set career highs in just about every offensive category and took a big step forward in terms of tapping into his raw power. At his best, he mitigates a reasonable amount of strikeouts with a fair walk rate, especially given his power potential. An infielder originally, he was moved to left field and he's a whole lot more natural there than he was at third base, projecting as an average defender with a fringy arm, one who also saw considerable time in right field in 2018.PERSON is still young enough to show he can fulfill his potential as an everyday left fielder, where there will be pressure on the bat. A career as a quality fourth outfielder who provides power and run production might be more realistic.",1
"  A native of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON made an impressive full-season debut in 2013 at ORGANIZATION A Hagerstown. He continued that success the next season with PERSON and in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's arm strength and athleticism behind the plate leave no doubt he has the skills necessary to catch in the big leagues. He blocks balls in the dirt well, already shows an aptitude for pitch framing and is improving as a game-caller.PERSON made progress offensively in 2014, but his bat remains well behind his glove. He has some pop and his easy swing gives him a chance to eventually hit for more average. As he moves up to the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION, his advanced defensive ability will allow the Nationals to be patient and allow his offense further develop.",1
"PERSON had more offensive upside than most of the high school catchers in the 2017 Draft, but the ORGANIZATION product resisted seven-figure overtures from big league clubs in order to stay home and attend ORGANIZATION. He still is known more for his bat, though he has gotten better behind the plate this spring after spending most of his freshman season at ORGANIZATION. Whether he'll be signable this time around as a sophomore-eligible remains to be seen.PERSON stands out as a lefty-hitting catcher with the ability to handle the bat. He regularly puts the barrel on the ball, uses the entire field and manages the strike zone well. He has more strength than bat speed and possesses solid raw power, though he's more concerned with making quality contact than swinging for the fences.If PERSON can continue to improve his defense, he has a chance to become a big league regular. He looks quicker and more agile than he did in high school, though his receiving skills are fringy and need more work. He has similar arm strength but his quick release helps him keep the running game in check.",0
"The grandson of former big league catcher PERSON, PERSON caught the eye of scouts by pitching well in the ORGANIZATION during the summer of 2015 and as a junior at FACILITY's (Calif.) the following spring. He did little to distinguish himself in his first two pro seasons after signing for $75,000 as a 14th-rounder in 2016, but he broke out and led all Minor League left-handers with 171 strikeouts in 135 1/3 innings last year. He has been even more effective in 2019 while jumping from Double-A to the big leagues.PERSON works at 90-93 mph and touches 95 mph with his fastball, which he can work to either side of the plate. It generates a surprising amount of swings and misses because its high spin rate creates the illusion that it rises. His slider also misses bats and serves as is his best secondary pitch, followed by his changeup and curveball.PERSON has some deception in his delivery that throws off hitters' timing, though he sometimes battles the strike zone as well. He has enjoyed more success against left-handers than right-handers, and he should have a floor as at least a situational reliever. But he continues to thrive as a starter and could get an opportunity in GPE's rotation before too long.",1
"PERSON put up video-game type numbers at ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION this spring, raising his Draft profile in the process, then created a huge amount of buzz by hitting triple digits consistently in a bullpen session in late May. The ORGANIZATION drafted him with the second of their two picks in the first round, then signed the flame-throwing righty for slightly above slot value at $2,452,900. There is no question about the quality of PERSON's fastball coming from his 6-foot-6 frame. He was consistently up to 97 mph all spring and has shown an ability to throw strikes with it as well. His secondary stuff, however, has been inconsistent. He throws both a slider and a curve, though the latter is his fourth pitch, and on some days he has two distinct, effective breaking balls. At other times, they run together, and it might serve him well to focus on just one at the next level. His changeup has improved, but it also comes and goes.There is an injury history with PERSON -- he had a screw put in his right elbow in high school -- but he was nothing but healthy and durable in junior college. There's some debate over whether his future lies in the rotation or out of the bullpen, where his stuff would play up, but the ORGANIZATION feel that PERSON has all the ingredients needed to become an impact starter.",0
"PERSON parlayed a strong career as a starter at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, including a championship in his sophomore year, into becoming a second round pick in the 2016 Draft. Thought to be a quick-to-the-big leagues college performer, things didn't go quite as planned, though he did lead the ORGANIZATION in groundout-to-airout ratio and had the best ground ball ratio of any pitcher in baseball, including the big leagues.PERSON has plenty of fastball, typically in the low-90s, but it plays up move because of his plus plus sink and his ability to get outs early in counts as a result. He does have usable secondary weapons and understands how to pitch soft, but doesn't always use it effectively. His slider is ahead of his curve, and he has good feel for a changeup, but trusting all of it has been an issue. He's smoothed out his delivery somewhat since his college days, but is still working to repeat it consistently. That's led to more control issues than anticipated, with a 3.9 BB/9 rate in his first full season.With the potential to have a usable three or four-pitch mix, PERSON still has the chance to be a back-end starter. If it doesn't come together, his sinker-slider combination could look awfully good coming out of the bullpen.",0
"PERSON was more polished than most high school hitters, and GPE happily took him with the sixth overall pick in 2012. Injuries limited him somewhat in his first full professional season, but he made up for the lost time with a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION, where he was the second-youngest player.PERSON has a loose easy swing, and he sprays line drives to all fields. He is an aggressive hitter, but he doesn't strike out a ton, thanks to his feel for the bat. PERSON has more power than his lithe frame would suggest, and he projects to have average power. He is an excellent center fielder, and he has a strong arm.PERSON has five-tool potential, and his makeup and baseball instincts allow his tools to play up. If he can avoid further injury troubles, he has the skillset to start moving quickly.",1
"PERSON was so advanced as a prep star in GPE that scouts viewed him more like a college pitcher than one in high school. He lived up to that evaluation, racing to the ORGANIZATION in his first full professional season as a 19-year-old. But PERSON's progress hit a roadblock in 2013 when he underwent PERSON surgery in June. PERSON returned to action this year, and he looks to be on his way to recapturing his top-tier stuff. His fastball sits in the mid-to-upper 90s, and it has touched triple digits. PERSON's best secondary pitch as an amateur was his cutter, but the ORGANIZATION took it away to force him to improve his other offspeed offerings. PERSON's curveball and changeup have both improved, and they have plus potential. PERSON is an exceptional athlete and his work ethic and makeup are very well regarded. He profiles as a front-line starter if he can make a full recovery from surgery.",1
"PERSON is extremely polished for his age, in large part because he grew up around the game as the son of Dodgers scout PERSON. PERSON tore the ORGANIZATION in his right knee in March 2012, four months before he became eligible to sign, but that didn't stop GPE from inking him for $575,000. Sent to the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League at age 17, PERSON had a solid debut last summer, despite being one of the youngest regulars in the league.PERSON has the bat speed and already-mature approach to hit for average, and he could have double-digit home run power as he gets stronger. PERSON can get off balance at the plate from time to time, but that's a correctable flaw.While PERSON isn't as fast as he was prior to knee surgery, he still has average speed, and he knows what he's doing on the bases. PERSON's instincts shine as well on defense, where he has sure hands, but he lacks the arm strength to play on the left side of the diamond.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in 2013, PERSON put himself on the radar two years later in the Class A Short PERSON York-Penn League, where he was named an All-Star after posting the circuit's fifth-highest average (.305) and tying for the league lead in doubles (21). He's gone on to earn All-Star honors in back-to-back years with PERSON and Class A Advanced Potomac, respectively, though the remainder of his '17 campaign is now in jeopardy after he suffered an ankle injury he suffered in June.PERSON's feel to hit has improved in each of his four pro seasons. He has a relatively simple, flat stroke from the right side of the plate that produces hard contact across the whole field. He's physically strong and shows good raw power during batting practice, but for now, it mostly translates to doubles during games. That could change in the coming years as he continues to fill out, and also by adding some leverage to his swing. The ORGANIZATION love how PERSON has grown into his frame without sacrificing any of his athleticism or speed.PERSON was signed as a shortstop and spent his first season at the position before shifting to third base in '14. He moves well for his size at the hot corner, showing athletic actions and plenty of range, while his plus arm is a clean fit at the position. After committing 25 errors in 2016, which club officials attributed to a lack of a focus, PERSON has been incredibly consistent this season, leading evaluators to peg him as an above-average defender.",0
"After PERSON tore the anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus in his left knee last May, he missed the entire showcase circuit last summer and fall. When he returned to the diamond this spring, he quickly displayed some of the best all-around tools available in the 2017 Draft. The LOCATION recruit has gone from forgotten prospect to potential top-10-overall pick.PERSON generates well-above-average bat speed from the right side of the plate. Some evaluators put similar grades on his speed and arm strength, though the consensus is that those tools are more plus than plus-plus. He should be a solid defender as well, though his instincts draw mixed reviews and he may wind up in right field rather than center.The one thing PERSON doesn't have is a history of solving quality pitching while swinging a wood bat. Some scouts worry that there's a lot going on his swing and believe he'll have to streamline it. If he hits and taps into his power, he has 25-25 potential and should become a star.",0
" Though he missed much of the 2015 season following ankle surgery, the ORGANIZATION were sure to have ORGANIZATION included in the big Cole Hamels trade at the ORGANIZATION in GPE, hoping he could fulfill the potential seen in him since he was handed a $1.3 million bonus, a record for a player from GPE has two plus tools as his calling cards: his power bat and his power arm. He has a ton of raw pop from the right side, but he has yet to refine his approach and strike-zone judgement in order to tap into it consistently. ORGANIZATION has as strong an arm as just about any catching prospect in the game, but the rest of his defensive tools remain a work in progress. Injuries have certainly stunted his development. ORGANIZATION has played some first base in games and done some work in the outfield, and he is athletic enough to handle such a move if it's necessary.The PERSON got their first real look at ORGANIZATION in 2016, and they had to like what they saw. There's time for him to still develop into a big league regular behind the plate. A full, healthy season would help him receive the needed reps to get there.",1
"A two-way talent at GPE, PERSON impressed scouts with his left-handed power potential but most teams liked him better on the mound. Signed for $1,575,000 as the ORGANIZATION. 31 overall choice in the 2012 Draft, he made his first big league start last July, though he was shut down shortly afterward with nerve irritation in his elbow. He went through the worst stretch of his career when he opened 2016 in Triple-A before taking six weeks off to deal with anxiety issues.PERSON's stuff regressed a bit in 2015, leaving him with just one above-average offering. His sharp curveball is his best offering and can be a plus pitch at its best. His lively fastball sat in the upper 80s last year but had previously resided in the low 90s. His sinking changeup wasn't quite as deceptive as it had been, while his cutter mainly served to give batters a different look.PERSON has the best feel for pitching among ORGANIZATION farmhands, so he doesn't have to overpower hitters to succeed. He can add and subtract from his pitches and locate them where he wants, usually down in the strike zone. Whether or not his stuff ticks back up with determine if he's an option for the middle or back of a rotation.",0
"The ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON after his 2017 freshman season, but he went back to school, raised his stock, and was the first ORGANIZATION arm off the board the following year. He has power stuff -- 93-96 with cut action at times, and a plus curveball -- but is wild and may be a reliever, though probably a very good one.",0
"PERSON led the ORGANIZATION in strikeouts in 2013. He also led that circuit in walks, a quick way to sum up what this young left-hander is about right now.PERSON has big-time stuff from the left side, with a fastball that will touch the mid-90s. He has a well-above-average changeup to go along with that heater. PERSON's curveball is behind the other two pitches, but it has the chance to be a usable weapon. He needs to learn to trust his considerable stuff in the strike zone more, and when he commands that breaking ball, he's awfully tough to hit.PERSON finished the 2013 season with a very strong August, something the ORGANIZATION hope carries over as he continues to get work as a starter in '14. If his command doesn't improve, a career as a lefty power reliever could be in his future.",0
" A left-handed-hitting infielder from eastern GPE, PERSON had a very good summer on the showcase circuit, playing well at both the LOCATION Pro Showcase in GPE and the ORGANIZATION held at ORGANIZATION in GPE. That performance didn't carry over at first to this spring, but he came on strong as the spring wore on, landing him in third round.Strong and athletic, PERSON has a solid left-handed swing and a good approach at the plate. There is some raw power to tap into from his frame, though he'll have to make sure he doesn't get too stiff and muscle-bound. A shortstop in high school, he'll better suited to infield corner, where his above-average arm and solid hands should play well. Whether PERSON can profile as an everyday corner infielder remains to be seen, but those who see his plus makeup and work ethic won't want to count him out. He saw time at first, third, left field and even shortstop during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, before getting a bump up to the GPE.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $800,000 out of GPE, they knew he'd be a project. Missing a huge chunk of the 2013 season due to an elbow injury certainly didn't help his development.PERSON is plenty young enough to make up for lost time, and he did make strides in terms of physical and mental growth. He played some first base because of his elbow and then to get him some at-bats in the ORGANIZATION, but he's still very much an outfielder. Still extremely athletic, PERSON has the chance to hit for average and power if it all comes together.PERSON is on the 40-man roster, so it's time for him to start showing more than just raw tools. The ceiling is there, now he needs to show it can translate to performance.",1
"PERSON didn't sign as the 10th overall pick of ORGANIZATION two years ago after failing a physical, which teams are still curious about despite the mid-rotation stuff he's shown the last two years.",0
"PERSON entered 2018 as a potential top ten pick after he perfomed in front of decision makers who were in to see PERSON last year. He displayed all-fields power and a chance to stay at short, especially for a growing amount of teams who are more inclusive about who they consider a viable shortstop because of newer methods of defensive positioning. As a junior, PERSON's approach became very pull-heavy and opinions on his defense have shaded toward third base. He may need to rework how his hands set up, because they're currently very stiff. He has big raw power for a prospect who is likely to play on the infield and some of what plagued him as a junior seems correctable, so his market probably starts toward the back of round one amoung teams smitten with his Trackman readout.",0
"Yet another talented ORGANIZATION prospect with deep baseball bloodlines, PERSON is the son of four-time All-Star PERSON and the brother of ORGANIZATION farmhand PERSON, whom the ORGANIZATION took 51st overall back in 2011. While PERSON didn't come off the board quite as early as his brother, his impressive hitting ability still got him an above-slot signing bonus of $1,100,000 as ORGANIZATION's second-round pick. He put on a hitting clinic in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League after signing, batting a robust .427/.451/.732 in 22 games, and then did so once again across two full-season levels in 2017, when he paced all Minor League hitters with a .362 average and captured ORGANIZATION MVP honors. The move up to Double-A in 2018 brought a new challenges for PERSON, though he was anything but overmatched at the more advanced level, earning midseason All-Star honors in the LOCATION as well as his second straight ORGANIZATION All-Star Futures Games selection. PERSON proved an advanced hitter during his amateur career, and his raw power was on display when he won the Under PERSON All-American Game home run derby in GPE. He combines plus bat speed with a violent-but-controlled swing to produce tons of hard contact from line to line, and scouts like his chances of becoming a plus-or-better hitter with above-average power. He's an average runner with good range and instincts at shortstop, and the ORGANIZATION plan to keep him at the position for as long as they can. Some believe he's best suited for second or third base, or perhaps even left field, but so far he's passed every test at his natural position.Much like his teammate and friend PERSON, there seems to be no limit to PERSON's offensive ceiling. His career-to-date points to a bright future as a perennial All-Star who could regularly compete for batting titles.",1
" The D-backs' 11th-round pick in 2014 out of GPE, PERSON struggled as a starter through his first full season of pro ball. A move to the bullpen for 2016 proved to be beyond wise, as the 6-foot-7 left-hander went from the Class A ORGANIZATION to Triple-A in one season. He capped off his year with a stunning turn in the ORGANIZATION League that included him leading the league in ORGANIZATION, K/9 and batting average against. PERSON has seen an uptick in his velocity since moving to the bullpen, and he was 94-97 mph in the ORGANIZATION. He couples the fastball with an 85-87 mph slider that has cutter-type action to it. His strikeout rate took a huge leap with the relief role and he's long been a groundball machine.  ORGANIZATION has been an issue at times for PERSON, though he was lights out in the ORGANIZATION, leading to his 0.00 ORGANIZATION and 0.55 WHIP. If he can continue to throw more strikes like he did in GPE, he has the chance to be a reliever entrusted with pitching high-leverage innings.",0
" PERSON needed just one year at ORGANIZATION after transferring from LSU-Eunice to establish himself as the best catcher in the ORGANIZATION. He capped off his junior season by winning the PERSON, given to the top college catcher in the country. PERSON excels defensively, earning high marks for his plus arm, footwork and receiving skills. Some thought he was the best defensive catcher in this year's Draft. His offense, however, is not as well regarded. PERSON is a patient hitter and regularly puts the ball in play, but scouts worry he doesn't make hard contact consistently enough. PERSON's defense and makeup are enough to set his floor as a backup and if he can improve his hitting, he could fill a much larger role in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"The trade that sent ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION has already paid the ORGANIZATION a huge dividend in the form of PERSON and, to a lesser extent, GPE d'Arnaud. If PERSON's transition to full-season ball in 2015 is any indication, there could be more payment on the way.PERSON, who received a seven-figure bonus from the ORGANIZATION when he signed in 2011 out of GPE, more than held his own at age 20 in the LOCATION. That he did so in GPE, one of the worst hitting environments in the ORGANIZATION, was even more impressive. PERSON showed some of his raw power in the first half, but he expanded his strike zone too much. To his credit, he adjusted, and his walk rate skyrocketed while his strikeout rate came down. PERSON has plus power potential, and his improved hittability could allow him to tap into it more consistently in the future. PERSON is an average runner with an arm a tick above average, with enough of each to play a capable right field. If the bat continues to click, he should have the kind of offensive profile teams want from the corner outfield position.",0
"PERSON comes from the ORGANIZATION area, hardly a hotbed for talent, but he distinguished himself in the summer before his draft year despite a slightly quirky uppercut swing. By the end of the summer, scouts had seen enough from GPE and PERSON to convince them that these swings could work, and that PERSON and PERSON belonged in the top few rounds, with both continuing to exceedexpectations. PERSON went in the middle of the first round in 2016, and missed time immediately after playing his first 55 pro games with PERSON surgery. 
He came back for his first full season in 2018 and dominated both Low-A and High-A, hitting over .330 at both stops with 20 homers on the season and strikeout rates below league average. There's some chance he is even more than just a 60 hitter with 55 or 60 power, which is what most scouts are projecting right now, with something like a 15-20% chance that PERSON turns into the next PERSON. There's some disagreement about whether his 2018 season was him dominating pitching that didn't challenge him, or if he has an approach that's a little too aggressive and he just got away with it in 2018. PERSON is a fringy runner who's an average defender in right field and has a plus arm, but he may bulk up and move to first base down the line, which would likely come with more power as well.",0
"Signed by the ORGANIZATION for $55,000 in 2011, PERSON wasn't viewed as much of a prospect early in his career, as he spent four seasons between the ORGANIZATION and PERSON levels before reaching full-season ball in 2015. But he broke out that year with PERSON, earning PERSON of the Year honors within the organization, and then took home the award once again in 2016 while finishing the year in Double-A. After the season, the ORGANIZATION added PERSON to their 40-man roster.PERSON stands out most for his natural hitting ability, as he's an advanced left-handed hitter with a mature approach and a clean, repeatable swing that generates hard contact from line to line. He has good pop, too, albeit mostly to the gaps, and had 63 of his 146 hits go for extra bases in 2016, including 45 doubles and 13 home runs.PERSON' below-average speed limits him to first base, though he is a solid defender there. While he's yet to show the requisite over-the-fence power to profile as an everyday first baseman in the big leagues, PERSON' feel to hit and on-base skills could make him a bench option for the ORGANIZATION in the coming years.",0
"PERSON proved to be a workhorse during his senior season at ORGANIZATION State as he logged 91 1/3 innings across a school-record 36 relief appearances. The right-hander struck out 112 hitters in that span and did not record a loss, finishing the year with a perfect 8-0 record and a streak of 22 2/3 consecutive scoreless innings for the GPE. Targeting PERSON's untapped potential as a starter as well as his potential discount as a senior, the ORGANIZATION made him their fifth-round pick in June and signed him for just $20,000.A tall, physical right-hander, PERSON arrived at ORGANIZATION State with a fastball that topped out at 91 mph but was hitting 95 with ease as a senior. He's adept at pounding the bottom of the strike zone with the pitch and complements it with a curveball and changeup, both of which have the potential to be average offerings. Given his ability to eat innings but also pitch in high-leverage situations, PERSON could turn out to be a valuable signing for the ORGANIZATION. He should be given a chance to start next year in his first full season, though he stands to reach the ORGANIZATION faster in a bullpen role.",0
"PERSON began his college career at FACILITY A&M before transferring to GPE, where he paced the LOCATION Conference in average (.382), home runs (12) and stolen bases (29) en route to ORGANIZATION player of the year honors in his second year with the Aggies. Intrigued by his combination of tools and performance, the ORGANIZATION gave PERSON $325,000 after selecting him in the fifth round of the 2016 Draft. PERSON fits the bill of a raw-but-toolsy college player, standing out for his top-of-the-scale speed and arm strength, with the defensive chops to remain in center field long term. He's less advanced at the plate, however, although he does show some feel for finding the barrel and has enough raw power to project for double-digit home runs once fully developed.Though his tools are impressive, PERSON will need time to refine his overall baseball skills on both sides of the ball. If it all comes together, he could develop into an up-the-middle asset capable of impacting games in several ways.",0
"Considering that PERSON was almost exclusively a reliever during his career at ORGANIZATION, the fact the 2015 first-round pick made it to Double-A as a starter in his first full year is impressive. But he missed the final month of his first full season because of a neck strain, and the ORGANIZATION decided this spring to move back to a bullpen role. That switch barely got off the ground as biceps tendinits and then a shoulder impingement has kept him off the mound for most of the season. PERSON does have a four-pitch mix he can use, with a fastball up into the mid-90s. He has a plus slider that's his best out pitch and he'll mix in both a curve and a changeup, both of which can be PERSON average. With a less-than-picturesque delivery and a slight build, there have been concerns about his durability, which is one reason, along with his ability to impact the big league club more quickly, to let him relieve once again. Most importantly, PERSON needs to get healthy before determining his future. As a starter, he could have the chance to be at least a mid-rotation starter. In relief, he could have both a 70-grade fastball and slider with the ceiling of a future closer, but that's only if he can stay off the ORGANIZATION.",0
" The ORGANIZATION pushed PERSON to full-season ball aggressively to start the 2012 season, but the ORGANIZATION outfielder wasn't ready. To his credit, when he was demoted to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League, he produced, finishing seventh in the short-season circuit in batting average. He was holding his own back in the ORGANIZATION when the ORGANIZATION sent him to the ORGANIZATION in return for reliever PERSON. PERSON is still very raw, but has the chance to hit for average as he develops. He may never have a huge power profile, but he could be the type of hitter who runs into 12-15 homers annually. He's played both outfield corners thus far, but seems to be settling into left field. It's his bat that will move him up the ladder and he's still exceptionally young, playing the entire 2013 season at age 19.Bernie Pleskoff's scouting report Â»",0
"A year ago, a high school third baseman in LOCATION gained some helium and ended up going in the second round to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON might not be quite at the same level that PERSON was in 2013, but there are some similarities in terms of his position and moving up boards as the GPE approached.PERSON can make consistent contact to all fields and hasn't seen a fastball he can't punish. He has strength and bat speed that should lead to plenty of power in the future. Running is not a part of his game, but he has the tools and actions to stick at the hot corner, highlighted by a very strong throwing arm. PERSON plays the game hard, with an aggressive approach. The team taking him, perhaps as early as the third round, could be getting a bargain in the process.",0
"Acquired by PERSON from the ORGANIZATION at the ORGANIZATION in July 2015, GPE excelled at the Double-A and Triple-A levels in '16 to earn a big league callup in August at age 22. However, shoulder fatigue combined with a team-imposed inning cap limited the right-hander to just five starts with the ORGANIZATION, who then sent him and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION for '14 first-rounder PERSON in late November. He returned to the big leagues in 2017 with GPE, but also missed considerable time with leg and knee injuries early in the season before taking the rest of the year off in July to address mental health issues.GPE pitches with an average fastball, sitting at 90-93 mph, but it plays up thanks to heavy sinking action that yields a high number of ground balls. His curveball is his lone above-average pitch, and he also mixes in a slider and a usable changeup. The right-hander is around the strike zone with all of his pitches and knows how to keep hitters off balance and guessing by effectively changing speeds.With an advanced feel for four pitches as well as a bulldog mentality on the mound, GPE shows the makings of becoming a backend starter at maturity. Perhaps more importantly, GPE, after receiving treatment for depression and anxiety that affected him for much of 2017, has returned to the game as an advocate for mental health and hopes to change its stigma within the sport.",1
"One of the best two-way talents in the 2014 Draft, PERSON preferred to play every day despite most teams believing he had a brighter future on the mound. The ORGANIZATION granted his wish after signing him in the second round for $914,600, and he has done nothing to make them regret that decision. He finished second in the Rookie-level PERSON batting race (.347) in his pro debut and won organization PERSON player of the year honors in 2015, hitting .385/.406/.659 after an August promotion to high Class A.PERSON is advanced at the plate for his age, showing precocious feel for understanding the strike zone and recognizing pitches. He has a quick bat from the left side of the plate and figures to hit for a high average, though he makes contact so easily that it cuts into his walk totals. PERSON differ on his power ceiling, with some seeing the aptitude and strength for 20 homers per year and others wonder if he'll have enough pop to profile well if he shifts to an outfield corner.PERSON spent the majority of his first two pro seasons in center field, making up for average speed with keen instincts. He definitely has the arm strength necessary for right field if he has to move, having hit 94 mph as a high school left-hander and registering 24 assists in 122 games last year. Makeup concerns dogged him in the Draft but club officials credited him with maturing and acting like a professional during his first full season.",1
" PERSON doesn't have overpowering stuff, succeeding instead thanks to his command and feel for pitching. He issued 78 walks in his first three professional seasons, averaging 1.7 walks per nine innings. That polish will give him a chance to stick with the Orioles after they selected him from the ORGANIZATION in the 2014 Rule 5 Draft. PERSON's above-average command helps his whole four-pitch arsenal play up. He throws his fastball in the low 90s, and he isn't afraid to come right after hitters with it. His slider is his best secondary offering, and he mixes in a curveball and a changeup as well. PERSON has been susceptible to home runs, partially because he has a tendency to leave his fastball up in the zone. PERSON's upside is limited by his lack of premium stuff. But his overall package give him a chance to fit into the back of a Major League rotation.",0
"PERSON was one of the ORGANIZATION' breakout prospects in 2012, and he continued that progress in '13, finishing his second year of full-season ball with Double-A GPE. PERSON built on that momentum during a full season in GPE in 2014.PERSON has fast hands, helping him square up balls consistently from both sides of the plate. He has more power than his frame would suggest, and he can drive balls to all fields. PERSON has above-average speed and aggressively uses his speed on the basepaths, but he is still learning how to be a basestealer.For all his offensive prowess, PERSON remains a work in progress at shortstop. He has good range and his infield actions are improved, but his arm strength is fringy. Scouts are divided on whether PERSON can remain at shortstop or if he is better suited for second base. No matter where he ends up defensively, PERSON's bat will play.",1
"Including PERSON, PERSON has now had eight pitchers taken in the first round of the past 10 GPEs. When the ORGANIZATION took PERSON. 5 overall, he joined PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON as top-10 picks. In contention for the top overall pick as the GPE approached, PERSON made it to the ORGANIZATION, who gave the best college right-hander in the GPE class $7 million to sign, nearly $1.3 million above pick value.PERSON got bigger and stronger in college, adding an inch in height and 40 pounds of good weight, leading to more velocity. He went from 87-90 mph in high school to 91-94 mph, with a high of 97. His best secondary pitch is a hard curveball that he employs against left-handers, and he mixes in a harder slider/cutter against righties. PERSON is also developing a solid changeup.PERSON's stuff could continue to get better, because unlike most top college pitching prospects, he still has a good deal of projection remaining. With his athleticism and arm action, he should have solid control and at least average command when he's fully developed, though he battled the strike zone at times as a junior. PERSON will be a frontline starter if he can master the location of his pitches.",1
"For the last three years, a pitcher from the ORGANIZATION of GPE has been selected in the first round. PERSON A.J. PERSON went No. 6 overall in 2016, with PERSON Dunning going at the end of the round. It was PERSON's turn in 2017, while both PERSON and PERSON were taken in the opening round of the 2018 ORGANIZATION. A strong spring could have vaulted PERSON into that realm of this year's ORGANIZATION, but the right-hander has struggled, losing his spot in the ORGANIZATION' rotation.PERSON still has plenty of power to go after hitters when he wants it. His fastball will touch 96-97 mph, and he consistently reaches the mid-90s. But a lack of life has meant it's gotten hit hard when he throws it for a strike. He has struggled to throw his slider, which had flashed plus in the past, for a strike, and he hasn't been able to develop a reliable third pitch, so college hitters have been sitting on the fastball. He has a tendency to not drive through the ball and can be too rotational, giving hitters too good of a look at the ball coming out of his hand.Because of his struggles, scouts have a hard time projecting PERSON as a starter at this point. If he can refine his fastball-slider combination, some see a ceiling as a setup type who can pitch the seventh or eighth inning, though a team taking him early in the ORGANIZATION could send him out as a starter with the hopes of fixing what's ailed him this spring.",0
"PERSON injured his elbow as a high school senior in 2011 and missed his first season at LOCATION while recovering from PERSON surgery. Signed for $70,000 as a redshirt junior in the 22nd round of the 2015 Draft, he served as a swingman in his first full pro season before taking off when the ORGANIZATION made him a full-time reliever in 2017. He was the best bullpen prospect in that year's ORGANIZATION League -- which he led with four saves as right-handers went 0-for-19 against him -- and then continued to impress in his first Triple-A campaign before going to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION trade in July.After working in the low 90s as a college starter, PERSON now deals at 96-98 mph and touches 101 with his fastball. Hitters can't sit on his heater because he also can make them look bad with a mid-80s breaking ball that combines slider velocity and curveball depth. He also mixes in a mid-80s splitter against left-handers on occasion.Though there's not much effort in his delivery, PERSON didn't provide a lot of strikes in college and hasn't in pro ball. He sometimes overthrows and yanks his pitches out of the zone. If he can do a better job of harnessing his power stuff, he could serve as a high-leverage reliever and perhaps even a closer at the big league level.",0
"PERSON was a two-way talent when the ORGANIZATION drafted him in the third round in 2010. PERSON originally made him a shortstop, but after two disappointing seasons in the ORGANIZATION, the ORGANIZATION moved him to the mound. PERSON threw 13 innings at ORGANIZATION PERSON in 2012 and struck out 23 batters. His prime weapon is a plus fastball that sits in the mid-90s and has touched 97 mph. PERSON also throws a changeup and curveball. The ORGANIZATION have a history of position players successfully transitioning to the mound and will put PERSON on a similar track.",1
" The son of former big league shortstop PERSON, PERSON was one of the youngest players in the 2011 Draft class and after two summers of pro ball, he still has a long way to go. He has hands like his dad, but he has the chance to have a much better bat. Heâs also too big to play shortstop, with the ORGANIZATION moving him over to third. He should eventually have the bat to profile at the hot corner, though it may take him a while to grow into his power. Added strength will help, as will improved plate discipline so he can tap into that power when it arrives.",0
"Like PERSON prospect PERSON did a few years ago, PERSON looked solid during summer showcases, then remade his body and saw his stuff explode the following spring. After touching 92 last summer, he's been up to 97 this spring and sitting 92-94. Rodrigueez generates this kind of velo with little effort, his pitches come in at a tough angle and he has great feel for a breaking ball. He's less polished than the prep arms ahead of him on this list but has similar pure stuff and could be off the board in the 10-15 range.",0
"PERSON is the best overall player from GPE in the class of 2019. He's a pure hitter and natural athlete with solid baseball instincts across the board. He is also known for his physically projectable body and easy actions on defense and at the plate. PERSON has sound approach in the batter's box and has shown the ability to use all fields with consistent and hard contact. There's a nice rhythm and balance to his swing and although he's primarily a line drive hitter now, there have been flashes of power and it could increase as he develops. He has impressed scouts by performing well against pitchers throwing 93 mph to 95 mph during workouts and showcases.PERSON is a quality defender in center field now and he makes all of the plays, but it's uncertain if that's where he will stay because he's not a plus runner. He developed his game in the youth leagues of GPE and has a high baseball IQ.PERSON is from GPE, GPE, and trains with PERSON. The ORGANIZATION are the favorite to sign him.",0
"PERSON spent three years mostly starting for ORGANIZATION, with mixed results. But scouts always liked his pure stuff. That, plus a dominant turn in the ORGANIZATION in 2017 was enough for the ORGANIZATION to take PERSON in the fourth round of the 2018 Draft, and he responded to their faith in him by pitching very well in his brief pro debut in the rookie-level PERSON League.PERSON's composure and maturity have already made a strong impression on the ORGANIZATION, and he's shown, at least early, more feel to pitch than anticipated. He challenges hitters with a fastball that sits at 94 mph and touches 97 regularly. His changeup is his best secondary offering, thrown with fade and excellent arm speed deception. His slider currently isn't a true weapon, and he focused on improving his breaking ball over the offseason so it becomes more viable.PERSON showed better command than he had at ORGANIZATION, with an ability to work to all four quadrants of the strike zone. If that continues, he has the chance to start. If not, he showed that his stuff plays very well when he closed during that stint on the Cape.",0
"PERSON had a breakout season in 2013, despite having to overcome a strained oblique that sidelined him for two months. As a 20-year-old at ORGANIZATION A San Jose, PERSON led all ORGANIZATION starters with 12.45 strikeouts per nine innings, and he pitched in the ORGANIZATION. He hasn't been as dominant in Double-A this year, though he has continued to pile up strikeouts.PERSON attacks hitters with his lively mid-90s fastball that reaches 98 mph. His breaking ball is a swing-and-miss pitch that looks like a hard-biting slider at its best. PERSON's changeup is still developing, but it gives him a chance for a fourth Major League average offering. He is still learning to repeat his delivery, and his command suffers as a result.PERSON earns comparisons to PERSON, and he has an excellent chance to join the ORGANIZATION' ace in the succession of homegrown pitchers to reach PERSON.",0
" Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in October 2010, PERSON made a slow but steady climb through GPE's system before breaking out in 2016, when he finished second in the LOCATION batting race with a .335 average at ORGANIZATION. Impressed by his development, the GPE selected PERSON in the ORGANIZATION phase of the Rule 5 Draft in December.Though undersized and lacking in terms of physical projection, PERSON is an excellent athlete who has long stood out for his plus speed and ability to play both outfield corners. He has good bat speed and a short stroke from the left side of the plate, with an approach that has continued to improve as he's climbed the ladder. And while he doesn't offer much in the way of over-the-fence pop, PERSON's combination of gap power and speed yields plenty of extra-base hits.With his solid collection of tools, PERSON shows the makings of becoming a fourth outfielder at the highest level, a role that the GPE hope he can fill for them in 2017.",0
"There are moments when GPE looks like one of the more dominant lefty relievers in baseball. He'll touch 100, his fastball spins and has life, his slider is consistently plus, and he hides the ball well. At other times he's unplayably wild. The early parts of GPE's 2019 spring were encouraging but, at age 27, it's unlikely the issues that have plagued him for years have suddenly been remedied. He'll likely be a scintillating and terrifying low-leverage relief piece.",0
"Selected in the second round of the 2013 Draft, PERSON hit .371 during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION and then claimed the LOCATION batting title the following year in his full-season debut, batting .340 as a 19-year-old at ORGANIZATION A Delmarva. He hit over .300 again in the ORGANIZATION in 2015 and received a late-season promotion to Double-A GPE, where he was more than four years younger than the average player in the LOCATION. PERSON has continued to hit up a storm this season in his return to GPE, and he announced himself to a national audience when he homered in the ORGANIZATION Game in July. PERSON has already proven to be an advanced hitter for his age, demonstrating excellent feel for the strike zone and an approach which caters to his use of the whole field. He makes a lot of contact with a clean left-handed stroke and never tries to do too much at the plate. He's shown a more discerning eye as he's moved up the ladder, leading to perennially high on-base percentages and walk rates across his first four seasons. Although PERSON had a few more balls leave the yard in 2015, he profiles as more of a doubles hitter with below-average over-the-fence pop.PERSON has good arm strength but otherwise is raw behind the plate. He's worked hard to improve his footwork and catch-and-throw skills in the last year, and scouts have become less skeptical about whether he can develop the chops to be an everyday backstop. The ORGANIZATION have challenged PERSON since Day One, and the fact that he had significant Double-A experience entering his age-21 season speaks to his track record of surpassing expectations.",1
"Scouts in the GPE became enamored with PERSON during 2016 extended spring training in GPE and PERSON poached him from the FACILITY before he had even suited up for a professional game. He was sent to full-season Fort Wayne as an 18-year-old in 2017 and hit .280/.390/.520 with 20 homers and steals and, perhaps most impressively for his age, a 14.5% walk rate. He also flashes occasional acrobatic brilliance at shortstop, though scouts are not unanimous about his long term prospects there because of the size of PERSON' frame.",1
Short but hyper-athletic righty who mitigates some of his size issues with a vertical arm slot. Sits 91-93 and will touch 95 with a long arm swing. PERSON changeup but stuff has otherwise been inconsistent this spring. ,1
"GPE of a Cathedral program that has produced big leaguers Jake PERSON and PERSON in recent years, GSP is in the mix to become the first high school pitcher drafted in 2015. He had a fine summer on the high school showcase circuit, repeatedly showing one of the more devastating two-pitch combinations in the prep class.Thanks to his fast arm and low-three-quarters slot, GSP imparts a lot of life on his pitches. He usually works at 92-95 mph with his fastball and when he stays on top of his 78-82-mph slider, it's a swing-and-miss offering with bite. With those two weapons in his repertoire, he rarely has needed a changeup against high school competition.His frame, athleticism and long hair draw some comparisons to PERSON, though some scouts wonder if GSP's slinging delivery might make him better suited for the bullpen. After verbally committing to PERSON as a high school freshman, he decommitted last summer and signed with PERSON A&M.",0
"He's quite little, but GPE is an athletic backstop with catch and throw skills, as well as advanced feel for contact. He's twitchy and mobile, which bodes well for his ball-blocking future, and he's a fine receiver and pitch framer already, though he hasn't caught a lot of big league-quality stuff yet. It's possible the physical grind of catching will take an outsized toll on GPE's little body and he won't hit enough to be anything, but on tools, at the very least, he looks like a good backup catching prospect.",0
"The biggest over-slot signing by the ORGANIZATION in the 2013 Draft, PERSON got $278,000 in the 18th round to pass up his commitment to PERSON. He has made steady progress, getting stronger and polishing his all-around tools to blossom into a potential five-tool player. A strong start in Triple-A this season earned him his first big league callup in late June, but he ruptured the patellar tendon in his right knee when he ran into an outfield wall in his first game with the ORGANIZATION and was lost for the year. Nearly a month after suffering the injury, PERSON was dealt to the A's with PERSON and PERSON at the ORGANIZATION for right-hander PERSON. PERSON makes repeated hard contact with a short, quick left-handed stroke. His bat speed, strength and plus speed give him 20-20 upside, though he's still learning to be an efficient basestealer. To reach his offensive ceiling, he'll need to get more selective at the plate because he walks infrequently and puts too many early-count pitches in play rather than waiting for one to drive.PERSON has made tremendous defensive improvement since turning pro. He has worked diligently with outfield instructor PERSON to refine his reads and routes, going from spending the majority of his time on the corners in his first two season to being a quality center fielder. He also has bolstered his arm strength to at least average.",1
"When the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the fourth round of the 2015 Draft out of the GPE high school ranks, they knew he had good stuff. But during that first summer, and even into instructs, the projectable lefty never showed it consistently. His '16 was a different story completely, showing more confidence and consistency from GPE Training through extended and two Minor League stops. While his 2017 season was initially delayed because of a shoulder impingment, he was throwing well during his full-season debut when his elbow required PERSON surgery in July.When healthy, PERSON has a ton of life on everything he throws. His fastball runs and explodes up in the zone, in the 92-97 mph range. He freezes hitters with his plus breaking ball, and the ORGANIZATION feel it might be a 70 power curve eventually. He's shown a good feel for his changeup, one that drops off the table at times. He has the chance to have three plus pitches when all is said and done, especially if he can continue to refine his command. There is a little funk to his delivery -- the deception adds to his effectiveness -- but he needs to make sure he doesn't get offline as much as he moves up the ladder.Right now, PERSON's primary focus will be to get healthy. He just turned 21 in June, so there's plenty of time, but he does need to show he can stay on the mound for a full season in order to reach his potential as a big league starter.",0
"Signed back in December 2012 out of GPE, PERSON started out moving slowly, spending a summer in the ORGANIZATION and one in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION, pitching mostly in relief. He moved into a full-time starting role in 2015 in the ORGANIZATION, then had a breakout year in his full-season debut, earning PERSON honors. The move to the hitter-friendly GPE League began well, with another midseason All-Star invite, though he scuffled after a strong April and May.After leading the organization in ORGANIZATION in 2016, PERSON was too hittable as a 21-year-old in the ORGANIZATION, allowing 10.7 hits per nine and a .295 batting average against. At his best, the right-hander mixes his average stuff in and out and keeps it down the zone more effectively. He'll throw his fastball in the low-90s and complements it with a breaking ball and changeup, which are inconsistent, but show flashes of eventually being PERSON offerings. He did miss a decent amount of bats in 2017, finishing second in the system in strikeouts and continued to throw strikes, though he'll have to command the ball within the zone better to have a chance to succeed at the upper levels.PERSON will be 22 for nearly all of the 2018 season, so there's plenty of time for him to hone his craft. His ceiling might be as a No. 5 starter if his stuff ticks up at all, with a future in the bullpen a possibility.",1
"PERSON has played a variety of positions since he set foot on the ORGANIZATION campus, but it's his bat that will get him drafted in the first five or six rounds.PERSON has played the outfield, third base and second base during his time with the ORGANIZATION. His ability to hit from the right side of the plate will truly dictate when he gets drafted. He shows signs of being able to hit for both average and power, with the ability to add strength a plus for future development at the plate. PERSON could be an intriguing offensive-minded second baseman, but if the bat comes along as some hope, he might profile better back at the hot corner or in an outfield corner. He has the hands and arm for third base, and he possesses enough athleticism to handle left field if needed.The team that thinks PERSON can develop into an everyday bat is the one that will take him, perhaps worrying about his ultimate defensive home later on.",1
"The ORGANIZATION selected two left-handers in the first round of the 2014 Draft, and they embarked on vastly different paths. PERSON (ORGANIZATION. 17 overall) became a big leaguer almost immediately, pitching in the World Series that fall before going to the Reds in the PERSON trade the next summer. PERSON (ORGANIZATION. 28) spent most of his first two full pro seasons getting pounded in Class A before improvements in his stuff and confidence helped him win PERSON's ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year award in 2017, but he has regressed this season.PERSON earned a $1,925,000 signing bonus because he projected as a polished starter with the potential for three solid or better pitches. But his fastball seemed stuck in the upper 80s in 2015 and 2016 before jumping to 89-91 mph and topping out at 93 last year. He added velocity and sharpness to his curveball as well while maintaining his effective changeup.Those gains have disappeared in 2018, as PERSON has lost some arm speed. When he's on top of his game, he locates his fastball on both sides of the plate and fills the strike zone with his entire arsenal. He'll need to figure out a way to keep hitters off his average-at-best heater to become a back-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"GPE's kitchen sink repertoire is headlined by a potential plus-plus changeup, but he also has a quality curveball, cutter and mid-90s fastball. He can throw just about any pitch in any count and has at least average command right now despite some mechanical inconsistency. He had a 172 to 35 strikeout-to-walk ratio at Triple-A last year and probably deserved to be in the Majors. He'll get there this year and projects as a #3 starter.",0
"GPE: A young PERSON Lofton.What's more, PERSON has been compared to GPE so often that many in the ORGANIZATION simply know him as ""Suzuki.""Scouts that have seen him play call him another name: Gamer.The speedy PERSON has an aggressive approach at the plate and has added mass to his frame since he left PERSON last year. He profiles as a leadoff hitter and has been clocked at 6.5 seconds in the 60-yard dash. He can play shortstop but he has good instincts in center field and that's where he'll likely end up once he signs.PERSON's body type is of concern to some scouts, but there's no denying his athletic ability and his track record. The teenager played for PERSON's 15-and-under team as well PERSON's 15-and-under World Cup team.PERSON, who was declared a free agent and became eligible to sign last winter, is trained by PERSON in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"In his first full season in the ORGANIZATION organization, ORGANIZATION finished fourth in the organization in ORGANIZATION as part of a deep PERSON staff. That made the trade that brought him to the system along with PERSON in return for PERSON and PERSON seem even better, with the ORGANIZATION excited to see what the lefty can do at the upper levels. A switch to the bullpen allowed him to move quickly through those levels, earning a promotion to Triple-A after 13 Double-A outings.ORGANIZATION is the prototypical strike-throwing lefty. He has a four-pitch mix, all of which grade out as average offerings. His fastball sits in the 88-90 mph range, but it plays up because he can command it and keep it down in the zone. His secondary stuff is good enough to keep hitters off balance. ORGANIZATION used to throw a cutter, but it's more of a true slider now and it's developed into a good weapon against left-handed hitters.Out of the pen, ORGANIZATION has been missing more bats than he was as a starter. He's close to being ready to help out as a southpaw reliever.",0
"The 2018 extended spring rehab group at ORGANIZATION often included PERSON and PERSON. PERSON, still 17 at the time, was just as big as both of them and about as fast as GPE, who is a 60 runner underway. PERSON is a GPE man-child, built like an ORGANIZATION wide receiver and about as fast once he really gets going. He performed fairly well in his first pro season and was pushed to the ORGANIZATION late in the summer. 
He has some swing and miss issues and his bat path needs some work to get to all the power that's coming, but the foundation for a combination of contact and power is present. It's unlikely that PERSON stays in center field forever, and he may even need to move to right while he's still in the minors, but the power that comes with all that good weight could approach the top of the scale. He's a high risk, high upside teenage power-hitting prospect.",0
"Emerged in high school hitting the mid-90's, wasn't used a ton at GPE, then emerged as their second best starter this year. Works 93-95, touched 97, can land and average curveball and his changeup is usable, but he's more control over command and may fit better in relief.",0
"Sometimes power relief arms can be found in unlikely places. The Rockies think they may have found one in the 21st round of the 2012 Draft by way of Bethune-Cookman University.Armed with a hard sinking fastball that can touch the mid-90s, missing bats and inducing a ton of ground-ball outs, PERSON had a very successful first full season, even seeing some time as a closer. He complements the fastball with cutter/slider that has a ton of bite. PERSON's control improved in 2013 compared to his summer debut, and his bulldog mentality is very well suited for short relief work.Pitchers who throw hard and keep the ball down in the zone have the chance to succeed in GPE, and it might not take PERSON too long to get there, with the chance to close games if his fastball command improves.",0
"GPE shortstops who can stay at the position in pro ball are rare, but the 2015 Draft may have one in PERSON. And while he struggled with the bat in his first two seasons at GSP and in his first summer in the ORGANIZATION, he gave cause for optimism by finishing second in the Cape in batting (.364) in 2014. PERSON got stronger and shortened his right-handed swing, and as he became more confident and aggressive, he began driving more balls to the gaps, though he hasn't hit as well during his junior season back at GSP. He controls the strike zone reasonably well and has plus speed, making him a potential fit for the top of the order. PERSON has the range and arm strength to make most of the plays at shortstop, though he can get error-prone when he tries to do too much. PERSON, his ORGANIZATION manager, said PERSON covers more ground than PERSON defensive stalwart PERSON, whom PERSON also skippered on the Cape.",0
"Hyper-sculpted, switch-hitting athlete who could fit at a number of defensive positions. PERSON plus tools across the board, including power from both sides of the plate. PERSON largely been seen in workouts and not against live, high-quality pitching, so we don't know much about his feel to hit but the elements are there. There's perhaps some PERSON here, and PERSON is physically mature, but we don't know of another 16-year-old on the planet with tools this loud and struggle to think of a historic example.",0
"GPE earned four of PERSON's (PERSON, GPE.) five postseason victories and saved the other, leading the ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION state 3-A championship in 2015 as a sophomore. Nevertheless, he stood out more for his offensive ability and that remains true two years later now that he's transferred to ORGANIZATION (PERSON, GPE.). One of the best prep hitters in the 2017 Draft, he could get picked as early as the second round.GPE repeatedly barrels balls from the left side of the plate and has a track record of making consistent hard contact against good competition on the showcase circuit. He has a quiet setup and focuses on drilling line drives from gap to gap instead of worrying about power. The ORGANIZATION State recruit has the bat speed and strength to produce average pop once he adds some more loft to his stroke.Most of GPE's value will come from his bat. Though he can touch 90 mph with his fastball, his arm plays closer to average in the outfield. He's a below-average runner, so he'll probably wind up in left field as a pro.",0
"PERSON passed on signing with the ORGANIZATION as a 17th-rounder in 2016 and instead opted to return for his senior season at ORGANIZATION, where he posted a 1.79 ORGANIZATION and 12 saves to finish with the second-most saves (21) in program history. The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their third-round pick in June, and he proved to be far more than just a money-saving senior discount during a stellar pro debut in which he reached full-season ball after signing for $454,800 below slot value.PERSON draws comparisons to PERSON because he's a lanky, side-armed right-hander with two above-average pitches. His combination of a low-90s fastball, that touches 95 mph, and a tight slider makes PERSON highly effective against same-sided hitters, and he's already impressed ORGANIZATION club officials with his ability to throw strikes from his unique slot.As a low-slot reliever who features both velocity and control, PERSON has the potential to jump on the fast track to the ORGANIZATION in his first full season.",0
"PERSON is a pretty volatile power-hitting prospect who currently plays shortstop on his high school team but probably ends up at third base, and maybe an outfield corner, at maturity. A portion of the industry would also like to smooth out PERSON' swing, but he's shown natural bat control and has the strength in his hands to do damage even if he doesn't time his stride well. This was evident last summer in the ORGANIZATION All GPE game when PERSON tomahawked a 95mph fastball off the LOCATION ORGANIZATION building at ORGANIZATION. There's some swing and miss risk here, which is particularly troubling if you don't like PERSON' hands and think he ends up in right field, but the tools package is electric and he could be selected in the middle of round 1 and probably doesn't get out of the comp round.",0
"Growing up in GPE, PERSON didn't have many opportunities to face top competition. His high school didn't have a baseball team, but he managed to play his way into the first round of the 2011 First-Year Player Draft.Despite his atypical background, PERSON has a mature approach at the plate. He lines balls from gap to gap and he knows how to work a walk. PERSON's swing has a little length to it, and he has been prone to high strikeout totals early in his career.PERSON is a center fielder now, but his average speed may eventually force him to into an outfield corner. His game still needs refining, but PERSON's on-base skills and quick hands give him the potential to be a solid Major Leaguer in time.",1
"Even among a historically talented group of ORGANIZATION shortstops (PERSON, PERSON, GPE Turang), PERSON was clearly the most gifted defender of the group and the best defensive high school infielder a lot of scouts have ever seen. He has 80 hands, above-average range, a plus arm, and an intoxicating flare and confidence not typical of humans of this stature. PERSON's size, or lack there of, is why he fell to the draft's third round, as there was concern he would not have the requisite physicality to hit big league pitching. After a few years of pro ball, scouts think his wrists and forearms are strong enough to put viable contact in play, but probably not with enough force to truly profile as an everyday shortstop. 
Sources who have seen PERSON and other punchless leatherwizards think the likes of PERSON and PERSON had more thump than PERSON does at the same age. That's not to say that they don't think PERSON is a big leaguer, as everyone thinks he's going to have a very long big league career as an elite defensive shortstop and infield utility man a la PERSON or PERSON. That type of player is going away, but we think PERSON is exceptional.",0
" The 2012 season was a good one for the PERSON family. PERSON had a very solid GPE debut in the GPE League while his older brother, PERSON, reached the big leagues as a reliever with the GPE. The younger PERSON has the kind of power stuff that would work well out of the bullpen, too, though it's way too early to stop his development as a starter. His fastball touches 97 mph and there might be more in the tank. His secondary stuff isn't as good, but both his curve and changeup project to be at least PERSON average. Like many young pitchers, he needs to learn to command his stuff better. That development, along with his secondary offerings, will ultimately determine his future role.",1
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 21, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON led the ORGANIZATION to a Class 4A state championship in 2016 and was selected as the ORGANIZATION Insurance/LSWWA Mr. Baseball award winner. The ORGANIZATION commit participated in the 2016 GPE Coast Professional Showcase and was named both a 2015 ORGANIZATION and a 2016 ORGANIZATION Mention.Webre makes frequent contact at the plate and has room for further development.",0
" A member of the ORGANIZATION' 2011 international signing class that also included fellow hard-throwing right-handers PERSON and PERSON, PERSON took off in 2014. He dominated the LOCATION and pitched his way to Class A Advanced Dunedin by the end of the season. PERSON has gotten stronger since signing and has added velocity to his fastball as a result. He now throws in the mid 90s and can reach 99 mph with the pitch. He commands his fastball well and creates groundballs thanks to its natural life. His changeup is his best secondary offering, while his slider remains a work in progress. After a breakout campaign, PERSON has the stuff to start moving quickly toward the ORGANIZATION. He'll need to continue to develop his secondary offerings to reach his potential as a frontline starter.",1
" PERSON hit everywhere he'd ever played before a surprising summer slump with the GPE collegiate national team. It carried over to a slow start during his junior year at ORGANIZATION, though he turned it up a notch and went back to showing an ability to swing the bat well, enabling him to climb into the first round and sign for full pick value with the Orioles.Some felt PERSON was one of the best bats in the 2015 college class. He was named the 2014 ORGANIZATION of the Year as a sophomore, after leading the league in all three slash stats at .351/.472/.557. PERSON has a quick left-handed stroke, strength and patience. He has plus raw power but he doesn't fully tap into it because he bats from an extreme crouch and has a flat swing. He might hit 20 homers per season if he stands more upright and adds some loft. A better athlete than his build might indicate, he was an all-state running back in high school. He has close to average speed. He has good instincts as a runner and defender, though a below-average arm limits him to left field.",0
"Acquired from PERSON for PERSON, PERSON is one of the more entertaining hitters to watch in the minors, but he has a few flaws that need to be corrected for him to reach his substantial ceiling, and possibly for him to profile at all. He has a very aggressive approach and a funky, high-effort swing from both sides of the plate, and they're only sustainable because PERSON has elite hand-eye coordination and bat control. His swing-happy approach could limit his on-base ability quite a bit, and possibly his power output, too, which would be less of a problem if PERSON could definitely stick as a catcher. PERSON has an elite arm but is a below-average receiver currently. 
Before they traded him, PERSON tried PERSON at third base and the outfield corners. PERSON seems inclined to just let him catch, but if PERSON' defensive movement is any indication, they're open to trying new things. There are probably certain types of pitchers that PERSON can catch without much issue, and it seems logical to pair him and PERSON in a way that hides PERSON's issues while he can work on them and still gets reps. If he does have to move to, say, right field, the lack of plate discipline becomes an issue because the offensive bar out there is much higher. The scouting report reads much like PERSON's, except PERSON is a switch-hitter with better natural bat control.",1
"PERSON was named ORGANIZATION of the ORGANIZATION II College World Series in 2012, when he helped lead LOCATION (Pa.) to a national title. He's moved quickly since signing with the ORGANIZATION for $65,000 as an 18th-round pick in 2013, reaching Double-A early in his second full professional season before being sent to the ORGANIZATION in June in return for PERSON. A 6-foot-5 right-hander, PERSON works from a low three-quarters arm slot that adds run and sink to a fastball that clocks at 90-94 mph when he's fresh. His slider projects to be average, thrown with sweeping action that can be tough on right-handed hitters, and his feel for a changeup has improved as he's climbed the ladder. PERSON was used as both a starter and reliever with the ORGANIZATION, but he started exclusively after the trade at ORGANIZATION and excelled in the role, posting a 2.59 ORGANIZATION and 0.96 WHIP while averaging more than six innings per start. And with his continued success as a starter in 2016, club officials believe PERSON could serve as a Nos. 4 or 5 starter once developed.",0
"After graduating high school, ORGANIZATION played basketball at ORGANIZATION II PERSON for a season, then transferred to GPE, where he re-introduced himself to baseball. He began throwing harder than he did as a prep prospect. The ORGANIZATION picked him late in the 2016 draft and ORGANIZATION's velocity has continued to climb as he has moved fairly quickly through the system, reaching Double-A and the ORGANIZATION in his second full season. He now sits 94-98 and has touched 100. He can alter the shape of his fastball to either ride or sink, and he will flash an above-average slider on occasion. He also has a well-below average changeup. With this size and small school, multi-sport athletic background, it's possible ORGANIZATION has some remaining development despite his age. He projects as a middle relief option.",0
" | Overall:4/5 The ORGANIZATION never shied away from high-ceiling high school arms with arm strength, so it surprised few when they took PERSON from the GPE prep ranks in the first round. Heâs been a little slow to develop, even spending some time coming out of the bullpen, but he appeared to be figuring some things out in 2012, even after being sent to the Phillies in the ORGANIZATION deal. The fastball is still a plus, touching 97 mph. He throws a hard slider as his best secondary offering that has cutting action to it. PERSON will show glimpses of a tight downer curve, but has been inconsistent with it. He even has feel for a changeup, giving him the chance to have four pitches in his repertoire. The biggest thing holding PERSON back has been his command, though his walk rate was better in 2012. Heâs never going to be a control artist, but with his stuff, he doesnât have to be, so if he just keeps showing improvement, he still has the chance to be a successful starter at the big league level.",1
"  The ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON in 2012 as a college reliever who could potentially get to the big leagues fairly quickly, and a debut assignment to full season ball shows they think the ORGANIZATION product can handle it. PERSON certainly has the stuff and mentality to pitch in short relief. His fastball will climb up to 97 mph and sit at 95 mph consistently. He does throw a slider, though it's not a consistently effective pitch, and he's shown a fairly deceptive changeup. He gets a good amount of swings and misses, though he'll have to refine his command and sharpen the breaking ball if he wants to close games in the future. If not, he still could be an extremely effective setup man in the near future for the ORGANIZATION.",1
"PERSON was a known quantity entering his senior season at ORGANIZATION (Ala.) High, but the difference between his present stuff and his projection was wide enough that he figured to continue his career in college at ORGANIZATION. He has narrowed that gap considerably this spring, however, as his velocity soared and caused his ORGANIZATION stock to do the same.As a regular on the showcase circuit, PERSON topped out at 91 mph with his fastball. This spring, his heater has sat at 90-93 mph and climbed as high as 97. His 6-foot-6 frame and low three-quarters delivery create difficult angle and sink, increasing his fastball's effectiveness. PERSON struggles to repeat his arm slot, which makes it difficult for him to stay on top of his breaking pitches and control his entire arsenal. His slider shows more potential than his curveball, and he'll flash a changeup as well. Packing more strength onto his slender frame would help him maintain his mechanics better while theoretically adding even more power to his fastball.",0
"PERSON no doubt benefitted from decision makers picking in the top five to 10 coming in to see PERSON, as his name seems to be in the mix at many of those teams' second picks. He's a stocky, athletic catcher with a fine arm, and surprising bat speed and power. He hit .320/.420/.626 this year, emerging as a likely Day 1 selection. PERSON hasn't caught a lot of pro-quality stuff at ORGANIZATION, so that part of his skillset remains somewhat unclear, but we think he's athletic enough to improve if it's initially an issue.",0
"Perhaps the most divisive prospect in this system, some clubs believe PERSON has a chance to play third base everyday while others see a bench bat ceiling on a player who has yet to prove he can handle other positions. He's a switch-hitter with feel for lifting the baseball from both sides of the plate, makes hard contact, and has plus-plus arm strength when he's able to step into his throws. But PERSON struggles to make throws from athletically challenging platforms, which leads some onlookers to question whether he's actually a good fit there, and his one-note, pull-heavy approach to contact may be less successful in the big leagues than it has in the lower levels of the minors.  The median opinion has PERSON pegged as a switch-hitting bench piece, but he'll need to learn to play other positions before that can become a reality. PERSON briefly tried him at catcher but that experiment ended quickly. The outfield corners are logical avenues to explore.",1
"PERSON drew very little scouting or recruiting attention as a ORGANIZATION high schooler, with his only college offer coming from ORGANIZATION. His stuff steadily has improved in his three years at the ORGANIZATION II program, to the point where he should be the first small school player selected in 2019. He should eclipse big leaguer PERSON (fifth round, 2008) by a couple of rounds as the highest pick ever from the Warriors.PERSON peaked at 91 mph with his fastball as a freshman, at 93 mph as a sophomore and at 95 mph on ORGANIZATION's scout day last fall. This spring he has shown the ability to sit at 96-98 mph for three innings at a time, work consistently at 92-96 and maintain overpowering velocity on his four-seamer deep into games. The pitch stands out more for the downhill plane that results from his high-three-quarters arm slot than its life, though he also will throw a two-seamer with some sink in the low 90s.His slider also has gotten considerably better during his time at ORGANIZATION, and it can be a plus pitch in the mid-80s with bite and depth at its best. PERSON hasn't had to use his changeup much and he'll need to achieve greater velocity separation from his fastball. There's not much effort in his delivery and he should develop at least average control if he can do a better job of repeating his mechanics.",0
"PERSON led PERSON to the 2012 College World Series championship, hitting .476 with two homers to earn Most Outstanding Player honors. A corner outfielder for the ORGANIZATION, he had the bat but not the power to profile at that position at the next level, so the ORGANIZATION moved him to second base in his first full pro season.PERSON's bat hasn't disappointed in pro ball. He has established himself as the best pure hitter in GPE's system, leading ORGANIZATION farmhands with a .318 average, 38 doubles and 256 total bases in 2014. His ability to recognize pitches and control the strike zone translates into consistent line drives to all fields.He still figures to top out at 15 homers per season, so PERSON's chances of becoming a big league regular hinge on his ability to handle second base. He has made progress there but still struggles with his footwork and probably won't become more than an adequate defender. His average speed and arm strength hinder his ability to play on the left side of the diamond, so his fallback option would be as an outfielder rather than a utilityman.",1
" PERSON's college career was at a crossroads at PERSON in 2013, when the ORGANIZATION announced plans to drop baseball and he required PERSON surgery after hurting his elbow. Though PERSON spared its program, PERSON decided to transfer to PERSON, where he became one of the better pitchers in college baseball. He finished the 2015 regular season tied for first in victories (12) and ranked third in strikeouts (126), both school records, enough to interest the D-backs in the third round.PERSON usually deals at 92-96 mph early in his starts and he's able to carry a low-90s fastball into the late innings. His fastball lacks life but still misses bats because his overhand delivery provides deception and downhill plane from his 6-foot-4 frame. His slurvy slider tops out at 81 without much bite and is often fringy at best.He throws a ton of strikes and has a usable changeup, but PERSON's lack of a reliable breaking ball may relegate him to relieving in pro ball.",0
" When the ORGANIZATION were in a pinch in June 2012, they called this Venezuelan middle infielder up to make his unexpected big league debut. Granted, he made just two appearances - though he did collect his first Major PERSON hit - but it was a sign of just what the organization thinks about his future. PERSON started out as a shortstop, and can still fill in there if needed, though he fits much better at second and should be an above-average defender there. He has the chance to hit for average, a line-drive hitter who makes a lot of contact and has a little extra-base pop as well. He's an above-average runner who can steal a base and concerns about him wearing down over the course of a long season, as he did in 2011, were assuaged with a strong second half in 2012.Bernie Pleskoff's scouting report Â»",1
"PERSON doesn't have a position (he's been tried at third, second and in the outfield since college) but he's going to rake. Scouts have him projected for plus hit and power. He takes huge, beer league softball hacks but has the hand-eye coordination and bat controol to make it work. He could yank out 30 or more homers as soon as he's given regular at-bats. The corner outfield and ORGANIZATION situation is GPE is pretty crowded but he should start seeing regular big league time this year. There's some risk that PERSON's aggression is exploited the way PERSON's has been, but otherwise PERSON looks like a stable mid-order slugger.",1
"GPE was known about PERSON when the ORGANIZATION made him the ORGANIZATION. 72 overall pick in 2014 out of ORGANIZATION State CC, but he's since emerged as one of the better pitching prospects in the Minors while making a quick climb through PERSON's system. PERSON reached Double-A for the first time in his second full season and then returned there to begin 2017 before advancing to Triple-A in mid-April and ultimately helping PERSON win the Governor's Cup. Along the way, PERSON was named the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON as the U.S. PERSON's starting pitcher, furthering his reputation as a confident, big-game hurler. However, PERSON will now be sidelined until 2019 after he suffered a right elbow injury in February '18 that required PERSON surgery. PERSON has no shortage of weapons at his disposal, as he'll show the ability to execute five distinct pitches in a given outing. He throws his fastball in the low to mid-90s, at times touching 95-96 mph, with late sinking action and backs it with a host of secondary offerings, including his trademark screwball as well as a plus changeup. His feel for commanding his above-average slider down in the zone gives him yet another out pitch, while his curveball represents a quality change-of-pace offering.Throwing strikes has never been a problem for PERSON. His natural athleticism, smooth mechanics and repeatable delivery all work in harmony to allow him to pound the zone consistently, and club officials note that his command has improved as he's climbed the ORGANIZATION ladder. PERSON is also a fearless competitor on the mound, and he receives raves for his ability to mix pitches, set up hitters and execute a game plan.",0
"Heading into this year, PERSON had had just one player get drafted before the 10th round, PERSON, a 2013 third-round pick. The school had also had just one player, PERSON in 2012, be named a ORGANIZATION semifinalist. PERSON joined PERSON in the latter category this spring and the left-hander almost certainly will join PERSON in the former in June.The 6-foot-5 left-hander has really come into his own as PERSON's Friday night starter this spring, using a three-pitch mix to carve up opponents in the ORGANIZATION. He'll throw his fastball in the 87-93 mph range, using his size well to create good downhill plane. His slider flashes plus with good bite, a pitch that has improved over time, even from his stint in the ORGANIZATION last summer until now. He'll effectively mix in an average changeup with some fade as well, and he's thrown all three pitches for strikes.With a somewhat limited ceiling, PERSON may not go quite as high as PERSON, who was the 86th overall selection, but he may not be far behind. After the dominant junior season he's had, he should easily beat PERSON, who was a 10th-round pick back in 2012.",0
"PERSON stunned scouts by outperforming PERSON (the top-rated righty pitching prospect in the 2016 ORGANIZATION) at the ORGANIZATION showcase last July, but he injured his elbow shortly afterward and took off the rest of the summer and the beginning of the football season. He returned to quarterback ORGANIZATION to its first-ever 3-A state title and earn PERSON football player of the year honors. He won PERSON's baseball award this spring, establishing himself as the state's second-best prep prospect in the ORGANIZATION era, behind only PERSON Erstad.Like Erstad, PERSON could be virtually unsignable out of high school and has the potential to become a first-round pick after three years in college. A Missouri recruit, he hit 95 mph with his lively fastball in his first start this spring, has topped out at 96 and worked at 91-93 during an 18-strikeout perfect game in front of a bevy of scouts on April 21. More than just a thrower, he flashes a pair of plus breaking balls and shows signs of developing at least an average changeup.PERSON's athleticism helps him fill the strike zone, though he could do a better job of incorporating his lower half in his delivery. Further complicating his signability is the health of his elbow, which had a slight tear in the ulnar collateral ligament. He was able to rehab the elbow and avoid PERSON surgery.",0
"The nephew of former ORGANIZATION State greats and eventual big leaguers PERSON and PERSON, PERSON opted to attend LOCATION rather than follow in their footsteps. He became an immediate contributor for the GPE, serving as their closer as a freshman before moving into the rotation in 2016, when the ORGANIZATION took a 36th-round flier on him as a sophomore-eligible. He's the program's best pitching prospect since the ORGANIZATION made PERSON a supplemental first-rounder in 2008.PERSON's fastball velocity kicked up a notch this year, and he now pitches at 91-93 mph and touches 95. His heater can be an above-average offering at times, as can his 11-to-5 curveball and fading changeup. He also has a slider, though sometimes his breaking pitches blend together.PERSON throws enough strikes to project as a No. 4 or 5 starter in pro ball. He looked like he might pitch his way into the top three rounds with a hot start in 2017, but he could drop him into the fourth or fifth after he wasn't as sharp toward season's end.",0
"There may not be high expectations put on a soft-tossing college lefty taken in the 13th round of the GPE. But when that lefty carves up two levels of A-ball and leads the ORGANIZATION in ORGANIZATION in his first full season, people at least want to see what he can do for an encore.Conlon excels because of his terrific feel for pitching and deception in his delivery, even though his stuff is fringy-to-average across the board. He'll touch 90 mph with his fastball but tends to sit in the upper-80s, and his two breaking balls, a curve and a cutter-like slider, will flash average on occasion. His changeup is his one above-average offering, and he throws all four for strikes at any point in the count, walking just 1.5 per nine innings in his year-plus of pro ball.His funky delivery makes him hard to pick up and makes his command and control all the more impressive. Whether his pitchability plays at the upper levels -- he was competing well but not dominating as much in Double-A early in 2017 -- will determine if he can be a back-end starter in the big leagues, though his success against left-handed hitters could mean he could thrive as a specialist if starting doesn't work out.",0
"If not for a very unfortunately timed PERSON -- which will keep him out until 2020 -- PERSON would have been several spots higher on this list. Among the non-Top 100 types of arms in this system, he not only has one of the better chances of remaining a starter but also has the best stuff among those who do, led by a plus-flashing curveball that he has great feel for locating. PERSON also has a great arm for a 19-year-old and may still throw harder as he matures, with his fastball already sitting in the viable low-to-mid 90s. There's some changeup feel here, too, and teams think PERSON has mid-rotation ceiling so long as his command continues to progress. 
The ORGANIZATION will need to make a Rule 5 protection 40-man decision on him after the 2020 season, a decision that will be made easier if PERSON hits the ground running after rehab.",0
"PERSON, a 2009 17th-rounder, didn't reach full-season ball until 2012, but since he got over that hump, he has shown the tools necessary to climb through the rest of the ORGANIZATION. He hit .335 at ORGANIZATION A Greensboro to win the LOCATION League batting title in 2012 and reached Double-A Jacksonville in 2013. He has a good approach at the plate, doesn't strike out much and isn't afraid to bunt for a hit. PERSON is a plus runner and uses that to his advantage at the plate and in the field. He has played center field, but the Marlins have increasingly used him as a corner outfielder as he moves up in the system.",0
"GPE of the ORGANIZATION's 2010 ORGANIZATION World Series junior division championship club with fellow Rangers prospects PERSON and PERSON, PERSON signed the following July for $650,000. PERSON spent his first three years as a pro in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION, winning the title game in 2014, and he began last season there as well. Promoted to the Rookie-level PERSON in June, he won PERSON' PERSON of the ORGANIZATION in his first two months in the GPE and deserved it again in his third after going 3-1 with a 1.10 ERA in six outings in low Class A.PERSON works at 91-93 mph and can touch 95 with his fastball, commanding it to both sides of the plate. He throws a true curveball with depth and has an advanced changeup for his age. PERSON may lack a plus pitch, but he has three effective offerings and knows how to use them.PERSON has no problems throwing strikes and has the confidence to use any of his pitches in any count. He repeats his sound mechanics well and has some hesitation in his delivery that throws off hitters' timing. After PERSON finished his breakout 2015 with six shutout innings in the LOCATION League playoffs, he has continued to deal in low Class A this year.",0
"The ORGANIZATION knew when they drafted PERSON, a GSP high school product, that it might take him a while to develop, as is often the case for prep pitchers from the LOCATION. PERSON has improved from year-to-year and could be ready to make a big leap in the near future.PERSON has big, raw stuff, starting with his sinking fastball which averaged 95 mph in 2015 and ranged anywhere from 93 to 98 mph. He pitches largely off of that fastball, with one of the highest fastball percentages in the system. While he doesn't miss a ton of bats, that is offset somewhat by the sink and hard, late life that leads to soft contact and a high groundball rate. His curve got a little too hard in 2015, which made it tougher for him to control consistently. His changeup hasn't progressed as much as some would have liked to see at this point.PERSON needs to show better consistency from outing to outing in order to stay in a rotation and he might profile best as a short reliever. Either way, the ORGANIZATION thought enough of his right arm to add him to the 40-man roster this offseason.",1
"GPE PERSON and PERSON were the two best high school pitching prospects in GPE in 2015, and the tall right-handers both spurned pro interest to attend college. They've blossomed into two of the more dependable starters in power conferences, with PERSON a possible first-rounder out of GPE and PERSON likely to go in the first five rounds. He moved into GPE's rotation midway through his freshman season and has been a mainstay ever since, with the exception of missing two starts with shoulder inflammation as a sophomore.Though he looks the part of a power pitcher at an athletic 6-foot-6 and 225 pounds, PERSON doesn't have overpowering stuff. His fastball parks at 90-92 mph and peaks at 95, featuring armside run and a bit of sink. He relies heavily on his heater and a short slider in the low 80s, rarely using his serviceable changeup. Though he has a long arm action that can affect the consistency of his secondary pitches, PERSON has improved his control and command throughout his college career. There's little effort in his delivery and he repeats it well. His stuff may be as good as it's going to get, making his floor as a back-of-the-rotation starter or middle reliever stand out more than his ceiling.",0
"PERSON was about as under-the-radar as a first round pick that went to a number of high-profile showcases could be. His 70-grade raw power puts up exit velocities that would fit near the top of ORGANIZATION leaderboards, along with good enough pitch selection to get to his power in games and enough athleticism to play an average defensive right field. He's only had 187 plate appearances in pro ball but could move quickly, similar to how PERSON' 3B PERSON reached Double-A at age 20, if PERSON's tools play as quickly as some scouts expect.",0
"PERSON had an outstanding amateur career, earning ORGANIZATION honors at the 2013 Perfect Game All-America Classic and then starring for the 18U GPE national team in the World Cup in GPE. The ORGANIZATION liked what they saw and drafted him in the fourth round the following year, making PERSON the first Nebraskan prep to be picked in the top five rounds since 1996. While PERSON's first full pro season was marred by injury, he moved up to full-season ball in 2016 and posted a .703 OPS while throwing out 33 percent of attempted base stealers in the LOCATION League.PERSON is a good athlete with a solid set of tools that could help him stick behind the plate. Though still quite raw, he has solid-average arm strength and promising catch-and-throw skills, and scouts believe he'll make strides as a receiver as he gains experience.A right-handed hitter, PERSON has a quick swing that yields line drives across the whole field. He's physically strong and has some raw power, though it may be a few years before he learns how to tap into it. Even if the power never arrives, PERSON's plate discipline and approach give him the chance to be a quality hitter.",0
"The Big 12 Conference pitcher of the year in 2013, PERSON beat out ORGANIZATION. 3 overall pick PERSON among others after missing the previous season recovering from PERSON surgery. He turned down the Phillies in the 33rd round to return for his redshirt junior season in 2014, when the ORGANIZATION made him an eighth-rounder. Put on the fast track because of his age (22 when he signed) and strike-throwing ability, he reached Triple-A PERSON a month into his second full pro season.PERSON's best offering unquestionably is his changeup, a plus offering at times that tumbles at the plate. His fastball sits around 90 mph but he makes it work thanks to command and deception. He never has had much of a breaking ball and his slider remains fringy. He may have just one pitch that qualifies as even average, but that doesn't stop PERSON from challenging hitters and pounding the strike zone. He has little margin for error, a point that was driven home when he gave up 17 homers in 19 starts at hitter-friendly PERSON. He's on the verge of reaching GPE as a No. 5 starter or middle reliever.",0
"The ORGANIZATION took PERSON, the grandson of ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION, in the 14th round of the 2013 Draft, and he advanced rapidly in his first full season, playing at three levels and finishing the year at ORGANIZATION. But he was unable to take another step forward last year back in the LOCATION, finishing with just a .246 average.PERSON has a compact left-handed swing that generates line drives across the whole field, but it's unlikely to translate to much power at higher levels. He has very good approach at the plate, with a strong knowledge of the strike zone that has translated to high on-base rates as a professional, though his strikeout rate did increase in 2015. He's an average runner who can play all three outfield positions, something that should enhance his value even more at the highest level.That PERSON's instincts and work ethic allow him to play above his tools has helped him to bounce back this season after his subpar offensive showing in 2015, as the ORGANIZATION promoted him to Triple-A in mid-May. Should he continue down his current path, PERSON has the versatility to carve out a role as a fourth or fifth outfielder.",0
"In his bio on the ORGANIZATION State website, PERSON lists former GPE infielder PERSON as his favorite athlete. As a three-year starter at ORGANIZATION who has the chance to stay up the middle, seeing PERSON follow a PERSON-like career path isn't out of the question.PERSON is a fairly athletic middle infielder who has performed well at a major college program, all things that should serve him well in the GPE. Some feel he'll hit enough to be an everyday player, with a worst-case scenario being a future as a super-utility type, one who has already shown the ability to play the outfield. With good footwork and a decent arm, it would pay to send him out as a shortstop and let him show if he can't stay there. PERSON is lumped in with other college performer middle infield types, with his left-handedness at the plate something that sets him apart. PERSON was taken in the fourth round of the 2007 GPE; PERSON could hear his name called by then as well.",0
" Another aggressive Latin GPE signing, the Aâs gave PERSON $2.2 million in 2010. He played in the ORGANIZATION in 2011 and then impressed in the ORGANIZATION in 2012, finishing among the league leaders in a host of offensive categories, from batting average to ORGANIZATION and ORGANIZATION. Heâs a long way from GPE, but he shows signs of hitting for both power and average, with a decent approach at the plate and excellent bat speed. Itâs unclear just yet if heâll be able to stay at third, with his below-average speed limiting his range. If he hits like it appears he can, heâll be just fine if he has to move to first base in the future.",1
"The ORGANIZATION used their second of two first-round picks in the 2014 Draft to get ORGANIZATION, selecting him 31st overall after they had previously taken PERSON at ORGANIZATION. 21. Signed for $1.6 million, he topped the Class A ORGANIZATION in strikeouts per nine innings (9.7) in his first full pro season before making the jump to Class A Advanced this year. Along with PERSON, he was one of two Top 100 Prospects the ORGANIZATION acquired in a four-player package for PERSON in late July.ORGANIZATION shows the makings of an above-average three-pitch mix. He's hit 96 mph with his fastball but usually sits in the 92-93 mph range with late, arm-side life and some sink. His curveball flashes plus and projects as a swing-and-miss offering at the highest level, and he made strides developing his changeup in 2015. A good athlete with a clean and repeatable delivery, ORGANIZATION has battled his control in Class A Advanced and needs to improve the quality of his strikes.At 5-foot-10, ORGANIZATION is somewhat undersized but still creates good downhill plane toward the plate and keeps the ball in the yard. Both his secondary pitches and his command require further refinement, but the southpaw has all the tools necessary to develop into a quality mid-rotation starting pitcher.",1
"PERSON was a senior sign out of GPE in 2018 after a couple years of production in the ORGANIZATION, but the frame, tools and how he did it didn't excite scouts. He's made some important adjustments to his offensive approach this year to unlock the utility of his tools and now has a shot to be a bench outfielder.",0
"PERSON is a power/speed center fielder who is performing -- who hit his way to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League as an 18-year-old. His natural, flat-planed swing is likely to change, but the hand talent to hit balls hard to all fields is here and occasionally flashes in games. He's also a 70 runner and will post some 80-grade home-to-first times due to his swing's natural jailbreak. There are likely to be performance growing pains as a result of swing work, but PERSON has impact offensive talent and will likely stay at a premium defensive position, so his ceiling is higher than most of the other players in this system.
",0
"Another aggressive high school PERSON pick who singed over slot in the 13th round in 2011, PERSON made his pro debut in the GPE League in 2012. He struggled a bit with the bat, but he still has the raw tools to be a good all-around third baseman. A shortstop in high school, PERSON has good actions and more than enough arm for the hot corner. He still has some things to iron out with his approach at the plate, but as he continues to fill out he should tap into his power in the future. As long as the ORGANIZATION continue to be patient with PERSON, his work ethic and raw tools could allow the finished product to be an everyday big league third baseman.",0
"The results in terms of numbers hasn't wowed anyone, but the stuff from this Venezuelan right-hander continues to impress. While he isn't the biggest guy in the world, he can get his fastball up to the mid-90s with good sink that generates groundball outs. Both his changeup and his slider have the chance to be PERSON average pitches. PERSON is generally around the plate and there's hope his command will continue to develop. If it does, he has the repertoire to remain as a starter. If not, or if his size is a concern, he could be very effective coming out of the pen.",0
"He lacks strength/bat speed but ORGANIZATION is more athletic than the typical catcher, and he's starting to put together an interesting plate discipline track record. He remains more of a developmental, slow burn prospect, but he's trending up.",0
"Entering 2015, PERSON had played in three different leagues since being drafted in 2012. In each -- the GPE, GPE and PERSON leagues -- he led or tied for the lead in home runs. PERSON, obviously, is what evaluators would call PERSON's carrying tool. He has as much power potential as anyone in the ORGANIZATION system not named PERSON. He's also struck out in over 25 percent of his plate appearances as a pro, and therein lies the rub. How will PERSON continue to tap into that prodigious raw power if he can't make enough contact? It remains to be seen, though he hit for power even with the move to Double-A in 2015. PERSON continues to work on his outfield play as well, with room for growth as a right fielder as he improves his footwork on his throws. In the end, it will all come down to his bat. If he can hit enough, he'll find a place to play. If he can learn to make just enough contact, he has the chance to continue vying for home run titles in any league he plays in.",0
"GPE's high school ranks aren't known as a hotbed of baseball talent, but PERSON showed scouts enough in 2012 to become just the fourth prep pitcher from the state drafted as high as the second round. He has had an up-and-down pro career, with shoulder and biceps issues derailing his first full pro season, a strong performance in low Class A in his second and struggles in high Class A in his third. PERSON's fastball comfortably sits in the low 90s and reaches 95 mph. He has a good feel for his changeup, and his curveball and cutter give him a useful pair of breaking balls. His control has wavered at times during his pro career and has done so again in 2015, contributing significantly to his difficulties. PERSON earns praise for his work ethic, which has helped him make the necessary adjustments to the professional ranks. That, his powerful build -- he wrestled in high school, and his dad is a power lifter -- and athleticism should help him as he advances in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"The D-backs selected PERSON 70th overall in the 2014 Draft out of GPE (ORGANIZATION.) ORGANIZATION and lured him away from a ORGANIZATION commitment with a $750,000 bonus. The GPE native took home ORGANIZATION honors in the Rookie-level PERSON the following year, only to be dealt to PERSON in a package to acquire PERSON and right-hander PERSON that offseason. In his 2016 full-season debut, PERSON, at age 20, hit 20 homers to lead the ORGANIZATION, tied for third in GPE (75) and finished fourth in slugging (.469) en route to PERSON's ORGANIZATION player of the year award. He scuffled with the move up to Class A Advanced Carolina in 2017, and then became ORGANIZATION property in the offseason when he was included in the trade package for PERSON. PERSON's plus bat speed and strong bat-to-ball skills from the left side enable him to make hard contact and drive the ball with authority across the whole field. The leverage he's added to his swing since signing has allowed him to tap into his impressive raw power in games with greater consistency. PERSON's aggressive approach yields quite a few whiffs, but is still advanced for his age, as he paced the ORGANIZATION with 72 walks in 2016. A fringy runner with good instincts on both sides of the ball, PERSON profiles as more of a second baseman than shortstop at the highest level, where his range, speed and arm strength are a cleaner fit.While PERSON's ceiling as a power-hitting middle infielder is tantalizing, he's likely few years away from making an impact at the highest level. Once developed, he could offer the ORGANIZATION premium production from an up-the-middle position.",1
" There's no question PERSON posseses all five tools on the baseball field. All he needs to do is learn how to use them consistently. The center fielder is a premium athlete who profiles as a top-of-the-order catalyst. Using a compact swing, he can drive the ball to all fields. He works counts and understands that he needs to get on base. Getting comps to PERSON, he has more power potential than the center fielder the ORGANIZATION acquired this offsesason. His speed will help him on the basepaths and in the outfield, though he's still learning how to use it more to his advantage. His arm and actions in the outfield work just fine. PERSON's arrival allows GPE the luxury of letting PERSON develop at his own pace.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",0
"The first thing you notice about PERSON is his hefty frame. He's listed at 6-foot and 225 pounds, but he's a bit north of that and has come into the last two spring training camps larger than expected. That said, PERSON's build isn't seen as a huge problem going forward, as it hasn't impacted his stuff, and most think he just needs to keep it in check a bit. PERSON indicated to us that had he not hit his innings limit late in 2018, he would've gotten a big league look in September. The condition of PERSON's pitching staff is certainly favorable for a soonish PERSON debut, and he'll likely open 2019 in Triple-A. 
He has above-average big league stuff, especially for a lefty: he sits 92-95 and hits 98 mph, mixing in a solid average slider and a plus changeup. His command ranges from 40 to 60 depending on the start, and PERSON's build often leads scouts to believe this is due to his conditioning. We're wary of discounting a player just because he doesn't fit traditional rubrics for success, and baseball is littered with unusual frames and mechanics, but PERSON has also had hamstring and oblique issues. The stuff is of the GPE. 4 to GPE. 4/5 starter range, but there's also a chance PERSON ends up in the bullpen. PERSON, considering PERSON's current predicament, we expect him to be developed as a starter for as long as possible. He'll likely be up in 2019.",0
"After dominating as a ORGANIZATION State sophomore and leading the ORGANIZATION in strikeouts in 2015, GPE was named the 2016 Mid-American ORGANIZATION of the Year after a spectacular season in which he allowed just three earned runs in his final 12 starts and ultimately led all ORGANIZATION Division I hurlers with a 0.69 ERA, the lowest for a starter at that level since 1979. The ORGANIZATION took him with the 25th overall pick in June, making GPE the first ORGANIZATION starter taken in the first round since PERSON went third overall in 1994.GPE has four effective pitches, three of which project as average or better, and he mixes them well. The left-hander creates good plane on a low-90s fastball that reaches 94 and has natural cutting action, and he's adept at locating it throughout the zone. He pairs it with an above-average slider at 78-83 mph that nets him whiffs with its late slicing action, as well as a solid changeup and a fringy curveball. GPE has crossfire to his delivery, but his athleticism allows him to repeat those mechanics and throw quality strikes, all the while creating significant deception. While he doesn't have a true out pitch or a lofty ceiling, GPE projects as a mid-rotation starter and he may have a higher floor than any lefty in the 2016 Draft.",1
"One of the most interesting prospects on the market, PERSON can play shortstop but his future could be at third base because of his outstanding arm.On offense, some scouts see PERSON's quick hands along with his uppercut swing and immediately view him as an all-or-nothing type of hitter.

PERSON also like how PERSON hits the ball hard to all fields and has the potential to be a home run hitter in the middle of the lineup in the future.He's a decent defender now and is expected to improve his defense once he signs with a team and enters an academy, but it's PERSON's bat that understandably gets most of the attention. PERSON also like his makeup and how he plays the game.PERSON is trained by PERSON in GPE. He is expected to sign with the ORGANIZATION.",0

He has solid arm strength and such a quick transfer that he consistently delivers throws to second base in 1.9 seconds or less. He moves very well behind the plate and is a good receiver who capably handled several pro-caliber pitchers on PERSON's staff.PERSON boosted his profile when he did the same to his offensive production, batting .382 with seven homers in the spring after hitting a combined .235 with two homers in his first two college seasons.

He didn't pitch over the summer as a precaution, but he is fully healthy and and pitched his way to Triple-A in his first full season.Even in throwing bullpens in 2017, GPE looked very impressive, showing the kind of polish he showed during his impressive ORGANIZATION career. He has four pitches, all at least PERSON average, all of which he can throw for strikes. He'll throw his fastball in the low-90s and reach back for a bit more on occasion, commanding it extremely well. His changeup is his best secondary offering, thrown with excellent deception, while both of his breaking balls are average pitches he mixes in very effectively. He has a strong feel of how to set up hitters, filling the strike zone with a simple and repeatable delivery.In terms of delivery and body type, GPE has reminded some of ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION don't have those kinds of expectations on the right-hander, but he has certainly used his advanced feel for pitching to allow him to climb the organizational ladder.",1
"PERSON served as both a reliever and a starter at ORGANIZATION. He does profile better as a reliever and could move quickly if he settles into that kind of role as a professional.The fourth-rounder's best pitch is a legitimate swing-and-miss slider that can sit in the mid 80s and features late tilt. PERSON commands it better than his fastball, which usually operates at 90-92 mph and tops out at 94. He could add a tick or two of velocity if he focuses on full-time bullpen duty.Though his strong build gives him the durability to be a starter, PERSON has some effort in his delivery and doesn't always repeat his mechanics consistently. His changeup lags behind his fastball and slider, but he could scrap it pitching in shorter relief stints.",0
"The ORGANIZATION knew that PERSON -- a high school product who didn't catch much in high school because of his athleticism -- would take time to develop. An injury-interrupted first full season didn't help in that regard, either. The ORGANIZATION made the decision in 2014 to move him to third base, at least for the short term.Pittsburgh's aggressive promotion of PERSON to full-season ball in 2013 proved to be challenging for the GPE prepster, particularly defensively. Shoulder problems hurt his development, but PERSON made strides offensively at instructional league, and the ORGANIZATION believe in his bat and work ethic.PERSON should get a mulligan for 2013, and the move to third will allow him to let his bat develop more, not to mention free up a playing-time logjam with ORGANIZATION.",0
"After the FACILITY charged PERSON with rebuilding their international program following a bonus-skimming scandal, his first six-figure signing was PERSON for $250,000 out of GPE in December 2011. He hurt his elbow shortly after turning pro and had PERSON surgery that delayed his pro debut until 2014. He led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION in 2015 but sliced his ERA from 5.38 to 3.81 and finished third with 141 strikeouts in 137 innings when he returned there last year.As a tall, lanky right-hander with a loose arm, PERSON elicited comparisons to former All-Star PERSON (no relation) when he signed. His low-90s fastball tops out at 95 mph, with the sink and angle on his heater creating swings and misses as well as groundouts. While his secondary pitches lack consistency, his slider displays some bite and he improved the arm speed on his fading changeup last yearPERSON still is learning to repeat his delivery and command his pitches. He did a better job in the second half of 2016, when he recorded a 2.79 ERA and limited opponents to a .202 average in his final 14 starts. If he can build on that progress, he could factor into the back of GPE's rotation in a couple of years.",0
"After a bonus-skimming scandal rocked the FACILITY' international scouting department in 2008, it didn't make a significant signing for five years. That drought ended when PERSON signed PERSON, ORGANIZATION's No. 2-rated prospect in the 2013-14 international signing period, for $1.6 million out of the ORGANIZATION. PERSON and hamate maladies limited him to a total of 91 games in his first two full pro seasons, but he finally started to hit as hoped when he stayed healthy in 2017.PERSON combines bat speed and strength with loft and leverage in his right-handed swing, giving him as much raw power as any FACILITY prospect. He hit just .225/.283/.356 with a 36 percent strikeout rate in his first three years a pro, when his stroke often got too long and too steep. Getting regular at-bats has helped him make adjustments this year, as he has started to recognize pitches better and become less pull-happy.PERSON's arm strength is just as jaw-dropping as his power, and those two tools make him an easy fit for the right-field profile. He's already starting to mature and could lose a step off his presently average speed once that process is complete. That shouldn't stop him from becoming an average defender, however.",0
" One of the better high school hitters in the 2014 Draft class, the ORGANIZATION felt fortunate PERSON was still there for them to take in the ORGANIZATION Round A, GPE. 35 overall.Two distinct shoulder injuries concerned some scouts, as PERSON separated his left shoulder in GPE, forcing him to miss a few games, but an injury to his right shoulder that required labrum surgery in 2011 is more troubling. He's been limited to second base as a result. PERSON's bat is good enough to make up for the concerns about his arm. He has a quick left-handed swing and makes consistent line-drive contact. He has a surprising amount of power for his size and out-homered PERSON in the first round of a charity home run derby in February. He has outstanding speed, making him a basestealing threat as well.PERSON may be an offensive-minded second baseman in the future, but one who can impact the game with his tools in a number of ways.",0
" Not the biggest pitcher in the 2015 Draft class, PERSON's stock took a hit when a stress reaction in his back forced him to the sidelines for most of his senior season. The ORGANIZATION were confident enough in his health to take him in the middle of the first round.When healthy, he has two plus pitches in his 92-94 mph fastball that tops out at 96 and a tight curveball. PERSON's third pitch is a changeup that needs more work. He has an easy delivery that enhances his ability to command his pitches and his chances to remain a starter despite his smaller build.The ORGANIZATION have shown a penchant for developing young pitching in the past and by taking PERSON in the first round, the PERSON regime is showing they're more than willing to go that route again.",1
"The ORGANIZATION developed PERSON slowly after signing him for an above-slot $897,500 as a third-rounder out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks in 2014, and they didn't promote him to full-season ball until three years later. His stuff jumped a notch last summer when he got to Double-A, where he logged a 1.95 ERA in nine starts, and he earned PERSON's ORGANIZATION of the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION acquired him along with three other prospects and international bonus pool money in a three-team trade in December that sent PERSON to the A's and lefty pitching prospect PERSON to the ORGANIZATION.As PERSON has matured physically, he has added to his fastball velocity and his ability to maintain it deeper into games, and he now operates at 90-94 mph with a peak of 96 and some running life. His heater plays better than its velocity because his delivery and 6-foot-4 frame create good extension and plane. His slider has also added power and features late bite, and his fading changeup continues to improve and shows flashes of giving him a solid third offering.PERSON battled his control when he first entered pro ball but now has no difficulty finding the strike zone. He has deception in his delivery that makes it difficult for hitters to barrel his pitches. Bothered by blisters early in the 2019 season, he's working on refining his command so he can attain his ceiling of a mid-rotation starter.",1
"After winning the summer PERSON batting title with a .349 average in 2015, PERSON posted even better numbers as sophomore at ORGANIZATION Charlotte last spring, hitting .384/.461/.555. His bat hasn't been quite as potent this spring, but he still has a chance to become just the second 49ers position player ever drafted in the top five rounds. The first was 1987 Royals third-rounder PERSON, who played briefly in the big leagues.With a quick left-handed bat and good feel for the barrel, PERSON consistently has hit for average. He has an extremely disciplined approach, rarely chasing pitches out of the strike zone and making contact with ease. He has some raw power but his line-drive swing is more conducive to doubles than home runs.An average runner with subpar arm strength, PERSON played left field as a freshman before moving to second base. He has been erratic defensively this year and will have to work to become an average defender at the keystone. His overall package is reminiscent of PERSON's.",0
"After hitting 13 homers as a sophomore last spring and then leading the GPE collegiate national team in all three slash stats at .372/.500/.535 last summer, PERSON positioned himself well in a 2018 Draft with a notable lack of catchers. But he has confounded scouts by not making more progress offensively, and they now wonder if his defense might be better than his bat. He still shows decent potential both ways, which along with his track record will make him one of the first backstops selected.PERSON's raw power is his best offensive trait, the product of strength and good-not-great bat speed, though there are questions as to how consistently he'll get to it in pro ball. He looks to crush everything to his pull side, leaving him vulnerable on the outer half of the plate. He has managed the strike zone well in college but his approach could get exploited by pro pitchers.PERSON has made strides behind the plate this spring, cleaning up his receiving and improving his framing skills. He has average arm strength that plays up a bit because he gets rid of the ball quickly and makes accurate throws. He does a nice job of running a pitching staff.",0
"At ORGANIZATION, GPE sliced his ERA from 5.60 as a freshman to 3.70 as a sophomore to 2.22 as a junior this spring. He cleaned up his delivery, improved his velocity and control and pitched himself into the second round of the GPE, where he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $900,600.After peaking at 94 mph with his fastball in 2013, GPE now works at 92-94 and tops out at 98. The life on his fastball also has gotten better, and he uses his size and high-three-quarters delivery to throw it on a downhill plane. His slider has taken a step forward as well and shows signs of becoming a plus pitch. With the makings of an average changeup and a strong build, GPE projects as a possible mid-rotation starter. His command isn't nearly as strong as his control, however, so it's possible he could wind up as a late-inning reliever.",0
"FACILITY PERSON seemed like the ORGANIZATION' version of PERSON, signing for $500,000 in November 2010 but not getting cleared to play until March 2012 because he had presented differing identities and birthdates during the signing process. He built more anticipation by blowing away Rookie-level ORGANIZATION hitters with a fastball that approaches 100 mph, and he did the same when he finally made his GPE debut at the start of 2013.When FACILITY PERSON got promoted to high Class A last June, however, he learned that he'll need more than sheer velocity to succeed at higher levels. He continued to average 93-94 mph with his fastball, but he got smoked to the tune of a 6.06 ERA because he had nothing else to help him survive.FACILITY PERSON has a rough delivery and struggles to repeat it, which compromises his secondary pitches and his ability to locate his offerings. He can run his slider up to 85 mph but it lacks consistency, and he has yet to show much feel for a changeup. He'll profile as a reliever unless he can add a lot of polish.",0
"The ORGANIZATION went all in on the international market in 2011, handing PERSON a $15.6 million big league contract and spending another $12.8 million on bonuses for amateurs, including $4.95 million for PERSON. The most expensive pitcher in that crop was PERSON, who signed for $1.5 million out of GPE. Elbow problems and cautious handling slowed his development until 2016, when he rocketed from high Class A to Texas.PERSON owns one of the best changeups among pitching prospects, and its fade, sink and deception help him keep right-handers in check. He throws it with the same arm speed as he does his sinking 90-93 mph fastball, which peaks at 95 and might pick up a bit more velocity if he adds more strength to his lanky 6-foot-5 frame. His breaking pitches don't stand out as much as his other offerings, though he did make strides with his slider last year and it's now more effective with his curveball.PERSON had a history of filling the strike zone before he reached Triple-A and the Majors at the end of 2016, but his control hasn't been as sharp since. He doesn't have a huge ceiling but does have a solid floor and is a good bet to become a No. 3 starter. The only real question is his durability, because his 114 innings last year were a career high and he worked as many as six frames just three times in his first 59 pro starts.",1
"PERSON turned down an offer from GPE out of high school worth well into the seven figures, which he'll almost certainly best this spring. He's a big, switch-hitting 6-foot-3 shortstop who can stick at the position in pro ball and has above average raw power from both sides. The issue is that he hasn't hit well with wood bats over the summer and has always had plenty of strikeouts to go with his homers in the spring (42 career HR, 20% career strikeouts). Some scouts worry that he'll be more of a 30-35 bat in pro ball who doesn't get to his power, making him a utility guy, while others see another candidate for an offensive adjustment that could make him a 45 bat, 55 power standout everyday player.",0
"A 36th-round pick out of high school by the ORGANIZATION in 2014 and again as a freshman at LOCATION CC by the Rangers a year later, PERSON finally signed with the ORGANIZATION for $250,000 as a fourth-rounder last June. In the final year of the LOCATION program, he set school records for hitting (.419) and homers (16) in 2016. He continued to rake in his pro debut, leading the Rookie-level PERSON in runs (63), total bases (161) and ORGANIZATION (1.052). PERSON' strength and the leverage in his 6-foot-6 frame give him massive raw power from the right side of the plate. His size makes his swing exceedingly long when he gets overly aggressive, so he may not hit for high average after batting .351 in his first taste of pro ball. He does make a lot of hard contact and shows the patience to draw some walks.PERSON moves very well for a big man, showing average speed out of the batter's box and plus speed at times once he gets going. He split his time between center and right field during his debut and fits better at the latter position. Though he needs to refine his reads and routes, his strong arm is an asset.",0
"PERSON made three trips to the ORGANIZATION in 2018 and he's had a few other issues that have caused the ORGANIZATION to throttle down his activity during the spring and fall. He has plus velocity, but loses a tick of perceived velo due to lack of extension, and his arm angle and spin direction are more conducive of sink/run that bat-missing rise. He will flash a plus changeup, and that pitch will likely be his best at maturity. The breaking stuff is closer to average. He was mechanically inconsistent this spring and has once again been placed on the ORGANIZATION with shoulder/back issues. There are days when PERSON's stuff and style of pitching resembles PERSON's, but the injury stuff might force a bullpen move.",1
" PERSON parlayed a dominant junior season out of the bullpen for an GPE team that won 27 straight games this spring into becoming the top lefty in the GPE class and the ORGANIZATION. 6 overall pick. The ORGANIZATION gave him full pick value at $3,889,500, signing him quickly and sending him straight to the Class A Advanced PERSON for his debut.ORGANIZATIONt particularly physical at 6-foot-1 and 175 pounds, PERSON's fastball nonetheless works at 93-95 mph and peaks at 98 mphl, even when he has worked on consecutive days. He generates that heat with athleticism and a quick arm rather than an excessive amount of effort in his delivery. PERSON has a deeper repertoire than most relievers. His plus slider is his second-best pitch, and he also has a curveball with power and depth and shows signs of an interesting changeup.His array of pitches and control should lead the ORGANIZATION to develop him as a starter, though he began his pro career in the bullpen with a chance to move him up the ladder quickly if needed.",0
"PERSON continues to improve and has positioned himself as one of the top players in this year's class.While some scouts think the infielder will eventually move from shortstop to third base, there are others who believe he has the tools to stay in the middle of the diamond. PERSON is very athletic, and some say he's one of the best athletes on the market. What's more, the teenager has displayed soft hands, good body control and solid range to both sides. He has also shown good arm and impressive actions on defense.He's still developing as a hitter but has already shown good bat speed and power potential. He destroys fastballs, and like most prospects his age, he's working on hitting secondary pitches. A line-drive hitter with some natural loft to his swing, PERSON can spray the ball to all fields.He is trained by PERSON in GPE. The Marlins are the favorite to sign him.",0
"PERSON was the ORGANIZATION top signing in the 2018 July 2nd period and the club thinks they have one of the safer bets in the class, due to PERSON's feel to hit and instincts. Some scouts saw PERSON without much power and with fringy speed and arm strength, but as is the nature of international showcases, often clubs get a look or two at a player when he is 14 or 15 years old, then not see him again until instructional league almost 18 months later. In those limited and early looks, players can change significantly, while feel for hitting and defensive instincts are often not obvious unless the club puts in extra work, which not all clubs can do for every player. The ORGANIZATION and rival scouts see an above average bat, average speed, and feel for the game. Some clubs see that as a bat-first left fielder with limited projection, while the ORGANIZATION see a center fielder with a plus bat, a combo that can post a sneaky 3-win season every now and then.",0
"In his brief time as a pro, PERSON has shown a knack for doing one thing very well: hit. And as most baseball people will tell you: If you can hit, you'll likely find a job in the big leagues.PERSON was raking in the ORGANIZATION State League during his first full season in 2013 before a broken wrist forced him out for a month. He has a knack for making consistent hard contact, and with a 6-foot-5 frame, he should add strength, which should lead to some of his doubles clearing fences. PERSON' other tools won't jump out at you, but he has the skills to be a decent corner outfielder.PERSON has played some corner infield in the past, and he could get another look there, but it's his ability to swing the bat that will continue to propel him up the ladder.",0
"GPE is a stocky, 6-foot-1 shortstop with an explosive first step who has a good chance to stay at short and be an average defender. His hands and arm are both fine there, as well. He has one of the more advanced bats in the class and has some present pop due to his physicality, with room for a little more. This is the second year in a row PERSON's top two J2 targets have had precocious bat-to-ball skills and limited physical projection.",0
"Though his surface-level stats -- .245/.340/.376 in parts of three pro seasons -- aren't impressive, PERSON is a 2019 breakout candidate. Switch-hitters with power are rare and PERSON has all-fields pop from both sides of the plate that, in 2018, was masked by the cavernous ballparks of the ORGANIZATION State League. A waist-high leg kick and loose, active hands provide much of the thump, and PERSON is athletic enough to make use of a swing with that much movement and not have it negatively impacted his timing. Though he has limited bat control, PERSON is adept at picking hittable pitchces to attack, and cut his K% down to 17% in 2018 while maintaining his above-average 11% walk rate. Defensively, PERSON projects in right field. He saw ample time in center in 2016 and 2017 but really only played in either corner last year. There's a non-zero chance he thickens substantially through his mid-20s and loses the mobility to play the outfield, but that might also mean he's grown into more power than we're projecting and fits at first base--offensively anyway. There's a good chance PERSON turns into a solid everyday outfielder immune to modern pitching staffs' desire to exploit hitters' handedness.",0
"A year before the ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON with the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick, PERSON was considered to be the top PERSON prospect in the 2011 Draft before ultimately going to PERSON in the second round. He scuffled early in his career before finally putting everything together in 2015, when he was named PERSON of the Year in the LOCATION and made his big league debut in September. But after such a promising campaign, PERSON has regressed across the board this season back in Triple-A. PERSON features an explosive 92-95 mph fastball that he threw for strikes more consistently last season, and he couples it with a plus curveball in the high 70s that has good shape and downer action. His changeup has steadily improved but still lags behind his two main offerings, although it does tend to play up because he repeats the same arm slot as his fastball. While PERSON's command has long left something to be desired, he previously had been able to mitigate those concerns by missing bats. That hasn't been the case in 2016, however, as he's walked nearly as many hitters as he's struck out in Triple-A. The ORGANIZATION have no choice but to remain patient with PERSON, whom they hope will be able to get back on track during the second half. But after such a promising campaign, PERSON has regressed across the board this season back in Triple-A, so much so that the ORGANIZATION demoted him to Double-A at the end of July.",1
"PERSON improved in each of his three years at ORGANIZATION, earning Big GPE All-Conference honors as a junior. The ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the 12th round that June, signing him for $150,000. He's done nothing but produce as a pro, using his blend of hitting ability, speed and defense to move quickly through the ORGANIZATION' system. He was a ORGANIZATION All-Star in his first full season and played just five games at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Lakeland at the outset of 2018 before advancing to Double-A, where he was an LOCATION All-Star and produced a .317 average with 23 steals. After the season, PERSON continued to boost his prospect stock with a strong turn in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON has a good feel for what he's doing at the plate. His approach is geared toward hitting the ball back up the middle, and he does so often using a short left-handed swing. While PERSON's contact is mostly of the ground-ball variety, it actually plays into his strength because he's a plus-plus runner with well-below-average power. PERSON is a skilled bunter, with the ability to lay it down either line, and he's an aggressive, sometimes over-aggressive basestealer. He fared better against same-sided arms (.340 average) than righties (.301) in Double-A. PERSON's wheels enable him to play center field, and he's seen significant time at all three outfield spots in full-season ball. That versatility, along with his speed and bat, give PERSON a clear path to the Majors as a fourth outfielder.",0
"PERSON is a physical, long-armed righty who throws really hard and is rather deceptive. His fastball gets some help from extension, but it enters the zone at a hittable angle and PERSON is fly ball prone. He also has a terse, upper-80s slider that induces weak contact more than it misses bats because it lacks length. It could be a weapon in on the hands of lefties, though, and PERSON has shown some feel for creating vertical action with it, though really onlt to his arm side. He's a relief prospect.",0
" At first glance, it might be easy to dismiss the 25-year-old ORGANIZATION as an older prospect. But if you take into account that he was a two-way player at PERSON, then missed the 2011 season in the ORGANIZATION organization following PERSON surgery, he's not far behind, experience-wise. He's proved himself to be a solid starter and reached Triple-A Las Vegas in 2013. ORGANIZATION has a fastball that should be a plus pitch and combines it with a potentially above-average slider. He also throws a solid changeup. If ORGANIZATION can have even just average command, he has a future as a starter and could soon be Major League-ready.",0
"PERSON was nearly anonymous as a prospect until 2018. He played at a high profile Atlanta-area high school (the same one as his brother PERSON, who the ORGANIZATION drafted in first round in 2016), played sparingly for a year at ORGANIZATION, then transferred to GPE PERSON's River junior college in GPE, ORGANIZATION, where he hit 17 homers, a feat that got him to ORGANIZATION for his junior season. He had a solid season for the Bulldogs but was a first base-only prospect with no pedigree who hit five home runs, so you can see why he lasted until the 13th round in the 2016 draft.  His hitability translated well that first pro summer and in 2017, which he split across both A-Ball levels at ages 21 and 22. The missing element here is that while PERSON had plus raw power the first time we saw him at ORGANIZATION, he didn't have the kind of swing or approach to get the most out of it. This untapped tool and his plate discipline are the reasons he was a 13th rounder and not a 35th rounder who went back to school for his senior year. In 2018, PERSON did a rare thing: he tried to do more damage at the plate and lift the ball a bit more, but was able to keep his contact rates the same while adding game power. PERSON did this in the ORGANIZATION farm system two years in a row and went from an untapped, toolsy prospect who was passed over in the Rule 5 Draft to a Rookie of the Year runner-up; PERSON went from the top of the 'Others of PERSON' section last year to one of the top 150 prospects in the game over a 12 month period. PERSON is a fine defender at first but the value here is all in the bat. Because he's left-handed, the downside is a platoon option at 1B/DH, though the ORGANIZATION cycle through those types very quickly. Underlying indicators and ORGANIZATION data suggest PERSON's very loud 2018 stats aren't fluky and he may just be a 50 bat with advanced feel for the zone and 60 game power, which is a solid regular. He might be big league ready in the middle of 2019.",1
"PERSON's profile, that of a defensive-oriented backstop, has everyone penciling him in as a career backup. It might be a mistake, though, to typecast him just yet.There is little question PERSON's work behind the plate will earn him a Major League gig. He can really catch and throw, having thrown out better than 40 percent of would-be basestealers in his career. PERSON moves well behind the plate, and he is a natural leader with plus makeup. He's the kind of catcher who will grow on a big league pitching and coaching staff. A switch-hitter who's much better from the left side, PERSON does have the ability to spray line drives to all fields, but he has no discernible power.At worst, PERSON is about ready to embark on a long career as a valuable backup, something that started with several callups in 2014. In the right spot, though, he could be a big league regular.",1
"PERSON and ORGANIZATION corner-infield prospect PERSON played together for four years at GPE, improving their numbers each year before turning pro as senior signs in 2015. A 19th-rounder who signed for $1,000 after hitting .395/.486/.682 in his fourth year with the GPE, he's battling PERSON to become the first position player in school history to reach the big leagues. He rose quickly through the ORGANIZATION system before stalling when he reached Triple-A in August.PERSON makes consistent hard contact with a sound swing from the right side of the plate. He's not a big guy but has average raw power and could translate it into 12-15 homers per season. He draws a fair amount of walks and makes the most of his average speed on the bases.Club officials rave about PERSON's baseball IQ. It helps him get the job done in center field despite fringy range, though he'll fit better on the corners in the big leagues. His average arm allows him to play all three outfield positions.",0
"PERSON was a known prep prospect as an underclassman in GPE due to his 6-foot-6 frame and ability to touch 90 mph from the left side at an early age. The limitation here is that PERSON has essentially never had a plus pitch and doesn't project to have one, working downhill from a steep plane and great extension with a low-90's sinker and an above-average four pitch mix. He doesn't have high spin rates on his breaking stuff and pitches more to weak contact, looking like a steady, durable, roughly league-average starter even as a college player. His feel to pitch and mix offerings in different locations is advanced, so the expectation here is for PERSON to save the ORGANIZATION some money on that No. 3 or 4 starter that so many teams overpay for in free agency.",0
"GPE ORGANIZATION hasn't had a high school left-hander taken in the first five rounds since the ORGANIZATION popped PERSON at ORGANIZATION. 5 overall in 1970. ORGANIZATION, a two-way star on PERSON's (ORGANIZATION) 2-A state championship team in 2017, is talented enough to break that drought. He also could blossom into a high pick three years from now if he attends ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION.While ORGANIZATION is more about projection than present stuff, he's a southpaw with life on his fastball and feel for spin. His fastball usually ranges from 86-92 mph with sink and should develop into a solid offering as he adds strength to his slender frame. His curveball already shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch with some power and depth.ORGANIZATION also has some aptitude for throwing a changeup. He's athletic and repeats his delivery well, working down in the zone from a three-quarters arm slot.",0
" The ORGANIZATION of the 2012 ORGANIZATION II College World Series after tossing a pair of shutouts to lead LOCATION (Pa.) to the national title, PERSON signed for $65,000 as an 18th-round pick the following June. He has advanced rapidly, reaching Double-A early in his second full professional season before being sent to the ORGANIZATION in June in return for PERSON Aza.PERSON works from a low three-quarters arm slot that adds run and sink to a fastball that clocks at 90-94 mph when he's fresh. It also produces a sweeping slider that can be tough on right-handers. He also has a fringy changeup that he doesn't trust as much as his two main pitches. The ORGANIZATION had used PERSON as both a starter and reliever, and he's more likely to fill the latter role in the big leagues. He fills the strike zone and keeps the ball down, though he must prove he can maintain his velocity over a full year after it faded in the second half of 2014.",0
"The ORGANIZATION gave PERSON slightly above pick value in the second round of the 2014 Draft to sign the ORGANIZATION high school standout away from heading to GPE. He was making slow, incremental progress, nothing out of the ordinary for a pitcher from the LOCATION, but the wheels fell off a bit in 2016 and he was sent from full-season ball to the ORGANIZATION complex in GPE. To his credit, he righted the ship and returned to the ORGANIZATION in 2017. The ORGANIZATION are hoping that hitting the reset button will allow PERSON to rediscover his stride, because they still believe in his stuff. His fastball is above average at times, even flashing plus, he'll show a plus curveball on occasion -- a true hammer of a breaking ball -- and he even shows a feel for a changeup. Throughout his ORGANIZATION career, he's been more hittable than he should be given his stuff, and he has really lost command of the baseball, both in and out of the zone. Most of that was because of inconsistencies with his delivery, and that was the focus upon his return to GPE, helping him be more athletic in his delivery. PERSON did show strides in making progress, and he came back to GPE early voluntarily to keep working on righting the ship, which helped him bounce back. He still has the weapons to be a starting pitching prospect if he can unlock them consistently.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION realized PERSON, a high school shortstop from GPE, wouldn't be around for their second selection in the 2014 Draft, they went ahead and nabbed him at ORGANIZATION. 24 overall.PERSON is an athletic shortstop with a very good chance of staying at the premium position. A switch-hitter with a projectable body, PERSON is a better hitter from the left side right now. There isn't much power at the moment, but he does have room to add strength to his frame. PERSON's best offensive tool will always be his speed, which plays well on both sides of the ball. He has the range, hands, arm and instincts to hold his position as well. PERSON's defense is ahead of his offense right now, but there is projection in his bat.PERSON is praised for his work ethic and makeup, and although it might take a while for him to reach his potential, there's no question he won't be outworked trying to get there.",1
"GPE's best pitching prospect since PERSON was a second-round pick in 2005, PERSON has struggled more than expected this spring. PERSON torched him for 10 runs in his third start of the season and he has battled his control and command for much of the spring. He did lead the Big GPE Conference in strikeouts for the second straight year, however, and still should fit in the first five or six rounds.PERSON uses both a low-90s sinker and a harder four-seam fastball, and he can maintain his velocity into the late innings. His curveball hasn't been as sharp as usual, though it still flashes good depth and he's throwing it for strikes. He masks his changeup well and it features some fade.PERSON has a clean delivery and repeats his high-three-quarters arm slot well. If he can regain the feel for his curveball and for locating his pitches that he has displayed in the past, he could have a solid three-pitch repertoire and make it as a No. 4 starter at the next level.",0
"Prime's breakout in his full-season debut in 2014, during which he led the organization in home runs and tied for the system lead in GPE, may have come as a surprise to those outside of the organization, but the Rockies weren't shocked to see the big first baseman produce.One of the harder workers in the system, Prime greatly improved his ability to turn on inside pitches, hitting the ball out front in order to create power to his pull side. There's still a good amount of swing and miss to his game, and he needs to improve his plate discipline so he can continue to tap into his above-average raw power consistently. Prime is still growing, showing up to Spring Training a half-inch taller. PERSON 6-foot-5, Prime is more agile than you'd expect. He has quick feet and soft hands that work well at first base, which should allow him to be a solid defender. Prime might just be scratching the surface. As he grows into his already strong body, there might be more power to come, allowing him to profile very well at the infield corner position.",0
"90-94 with average secondaries, the curveball more consistent than the change. On starter/reliever fringe.",0
"Baseball development isn't always a straight path and sometimes prospects need to take a step back to move forward. That seems to be the case with PERSON, who wasn't ready for full-season ball in 2015, righted the ship after a move back to the Rookie-level Appalachian League, then handled the ORGANIZATION in 2016 by finishing ninth in batting average and tied for third in stolen bases. He jumped on the fast track in 2017, moving up to Double-A early in the season and even making his big league debut in May, and then joined the ORGANIZATION in December with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON as part of the ORGANIZATION trade.While PERSON could stand to refine his approach and draw more walks, especially since he profiles as a top-of-the-order type hitter, he does have a knack for making consistent hard contact. He doesn't have over-the-fence power, but PERSON has enough strength to hit the gaps. From there, his speed allows him to take extra bases and he should become a more efficient basestealer as he progresses. PERSON is an elite-level defender in center field, the kind who regularly makes highlight-reel plays, and he has a plus arm to boot.Seeing a young player show they can bounce back after struggling, that they can demonstrate and learn from adversity, is important in development. That skill, along with his natural tools, has allowed PERSON to make progress up the ladder.",1
"PERSON first started to raise his profile in the ORGANIZATION in 2015, then with a strong junior season at ORGANIZATION in 2016. The top pure college hitter in that GPE class, he went No. 2 overall to the ORGANIZATION, signing for $6.2 million, the top bonus in the GPE, albeit below pick value. PERSON kept on producing during his pro debut, spending most of it batting over .300 in the full-season ORGANIZATION, then kept on hitting during his first full season, earning a promotion to Double-A.The right-handed hitter has both strength and bat speed to go along with an advanced approach at the plate. He uses all fields and draws walks, which should help him continue to hit for both average and power. His speed plays up thanks to outstanding instincts which allow him to be a base stealing threat. PERSON has worked hard on his defensive craft and there are no longer questions about his ability to stay at the hot corner long-term, with a strong arm, good hands and quick feet.PERSON has jumped on a fast track by reaching Double-A in 2017. Seeing him be the first bat from his GPE class to reach the big leagues certainly seems reasonable.",1
"GPE love PERSON's 6-foot-1, 178-pound frame.He's lean -- some evaluators even describe him as lanky -- and he is athletic, with room to grow. On defense, some scouts view him as the ideal center fielder because of his ability to read balls off the bat and his defensive instincts. He has also impressed evaluators with his reactions to balls hit into the gaps.In the batter's box, PERSON is a natural left-handed hitter with a fluid stroke and a good approach in games. He has also shown some power.PERSON's arm is best described as playable, and he has enough arm strength to play his primary position in center field. He does have some experience playing in the infield, particularly at second base, but his future will be in the outfield as long as he continues to develop.PERSON signed a $2 million deal with the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON didn't stay in shape and pitched just 10 innings as an GPE freshman in 2012, but he improved his conditioning and pitched himself into the sixth round the following spring at FACILITY (GPE) CC. Signed for $300,000, he dominated in his first two years of full-season ball, posting a 181/34 K/BB ratio in 144 innings and holding opponents to a .190 average.PERSON can attribute his success to one pitch. He entered pro ball with a low-90s fastball but picked up velocity when the ORGANIZATION streamlined his mechanics following his lackluster pro debut. He now operates at 94-98 mph and reaches triple digits on a four-seamer that plays up even further because of its riding life and the deception in his delivery.He can mix in a two-seamer in the low 90s when he wants more sink, but PERSON still is searching for something reliable beyond his fastball. While he can run his slider into the upper 80s, it's a fringy pitch that lacks tilt, and he hasn't had much luck with a splitter. If he can find a second pitch, he could be a high-leverage reliever in the big leagues.",1
"In an age when more and more teams are taking model-driven approaches to building a draft board, PERSON's age looms large. A player's age relative to his peers is a predictive variable for pro success (younger is better) and PERSON is older than a lot of last year's high scohol draftees. Not older than they were on draft day. Older than they are right now, and PERSON is two years older than Day 1 prospect PERSON. But tools-wise, he compares quite closely to Cardinals 2018 first rounder and top 100 prospect PERSON, and those tools belong in the middle of the first round. PERSON is big, strong, and has huge power and advanced feel to hit. He may not be an athletic fit at third base, especially long term, and is at risk of moving to first. The age issue slides him a shade beneath where we had PERSON's FV last year, and we consider PERSON's first pro summer, probably at an advanced rookie affiliate, to be of greater than usual importance in assessing his skills in an age-appropriate competitive environment.",0
"PERSON led the ORGANIZATION with 12 homers (in just 27 games) in the summer of 2015, garnering some Kris Bryant comparisons while establishing himself as the best college power hitter available and a likely first-round pick in the 2016 Draft. He slumped as a junior at PERSON, however, making a greater impact on the mound as the ORGANIZATION placed second at the ORGANIZATION World Series. He looked like a steal after signing for an above-slot $650,000 as a fourth-rounder, batting .386/.427/.674 at short-season PERSON, but an old hamate injury sidelined him and contributed to a slow start in 2017.PERSON offers massive power potential, generating it with prodigious strength, bat speed and loft in his right-handed stroke and an aggressive approach. After trying to do too much at the plate with PERSON, he maintained a consistent routine in his debut, doing a better job of using the middle of the field and letting pitches travel deep. If he continues to let his power come naturally, he could hit for a decent average and produce 30 homers per year.While PERSON lacks speed, he improved his range at third base in 2016 and most scouts think he'll be able to stay at the hot corner. There's no question that he has the arm for the position after he maintained a low-90s fastball and an effective slider while opening his junior season as the ORGANIZATION' closer and finishing it as their top starter. He topped all Division I pitchers with 41 strikeouts during the ORGANIZATION tournament and allowed just two earned runs in three ORGANIZATION starts.",0
"PERSON begins to separate himself from most catching prospects with his glove. He was drafted as a third baseman in 2012, then moved behind the plate in 2014 and picked up the finer points of catching rather quickly. Heâs a good receiver, stealing strikes on the edges of the zone and just beneath it. Heâs also more agile than his square, cinder-block frame suggests, and he effectively smothers errant, dirt-bound pitches. Big-league catchers hit a combined .245/.315/.406 in 2017, averaging just 89 wRC+. Despite lackluster physical tools, PERSON should be able to clear that bar, based largely on his superlative hand-eye coordination and a sound approach, all complemented by excellent defense.",1
" The GPE named PERSON their Minor League Player of the Year in 2013, his first full professional season. Though he advanced to Double-A in 2014, his progress there was slowed by a broken hamate. That didn't deter the A's from acquiring him in December in exchange for PERSON.  PERSON stands out most for his hitting ability. He has a good approach at the plate and uses the whole field to hit, squaring up balls with his compact swing. He has more power than his size suggests and has proved capable of driving the ball over the fence everywhere he's gone. PERSON is a steady defender at second base, capable of making all the necessary plays. He earns praise for his makeup and blue-collar mentality, traits that have helped him rise through the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON's first few pro seasons were notable because of how quickly PERSON pushed him through the minors. A polished strike-thrower with four good pitches, he reached Double-A as a 19-year-old back in 2017 before he became the centerpiece of the ORGANIZATION Verlander deal. Advanced though he was, various injuries have robbed PERSON of innings. He has yet to throw more than 86 frames in an entire season, so while he may be fairly advanced for someone his age, and definitely for someone who has pitched so little, the industry has yet to see his stuff hold up for a whole summer of starter's innings. 
In 2016, he had knee trouble; in 2018, it was a lat strain, then shoulder inflammation. An ominous trap issue popped up during the early parts of 2019 spring training but PERSON was back on the mound quickly and sitting his usual 93-96 into late-March. A strong-bodied 21-year-old, the cement is likely dry on PERSON's stuff. His high three-quarters slot creates ride to his fastball as well as downward vertical action on his curveball, and those two traits typically pair well together. While PERSON's curveball is his prettiest pitch, his best secondary offering is the changeup. There are times when PERSON will come across the baseball and create screwball action on the change, and it runs, sometimes unhittably, onto the glove side corner of the plate. But mostly, it's used as a swing-and-miss pitch that bottoms out beneath the strike zone just as it reaches the plate. PERSON has mid-rotation stuff and strike-throwing ability, but needs a fully healthy season to be valued at that level across the league. ",0
"ORGANIZATION (Calif.) PERSON featured a pair of prospects who got paid in the later rounds of the 2013 Draft: PERSON, who got $800,000 from the ORGANIZATION in the sixth, and PERSON, who signed for $850,000 with the ORGANIZATION in the 30th. After playing mostly shortstop at ORGANIZATION and the middle infield in his pro debut, PERSON became a full-time catcher in 2014.PERSON has a chance to contribute both offensively and defensively, and he surged at the plate in the second half of 2015, batting .335/.444/.607 with all 13 of his homers and prompting one club official to compare his sweet left-handed swing to that of PERSON. Though the results haven't been there in high Class A this year, PERSON has maintained a quality approach, patiently controlling the strike zone and focusing on using the center of the field. The ORGANIZATION still believe in his power and think he can hit 15 or more homers per season.For someone who shifted behind the plate full-time just two years ago, PERSON is an advanced defender. He has soft hands and moves well, though his receiving skills have slipped this year. PERSON also has solid arm strength, but he needs to improve the accuracy of his throws.",1
"GPE has built another strong recruiting class around GPE high school outfielder PERSON, a likely first-rounder who probably won't make it to college, and the top five prep prospects in GPE. The best of that group is PERSON, who helped GPE (GPEpolis) to the GPE 4-A state championship in 2016 and will be the first player ever drafted from the school. He performed well on the showcase circuit last summer, displaying a consistent all-around game.PERSON has a sound left-handed swing and uses the entire field. Though he has mostly gap power right now, he has the solid bat speed and wiry strength to develop average power once he fills out his extremely projectable frame. He currently has plus speed but could lose a step as he gets stronger.PERSON offers a well-rounded defensive package as well. He has the quickness and instincts to stay in center field and the strong arm to also profile well in right. Also a pitcher, he can run his fastball into the low 90s.",0
"GPE colleges are always well-scouted, but it's rare when a game at that level in GPE brings in cross-checkers and scouting directors. That's what happened when PERSON's Polk State played PERSON's ORGANIZATION of GPE Manatee-Sarasota. By many accounts, PERSON outpitched GPE, putting him much more firmly on the GPE prospect map.In that game, and for much of the season, PERSON showed excellent arm strength and a good, clean delivery. He can maintain his velocity, as he did by still touching 95 mph in the seventh inning against GPE and sitting 90-95 mph throughout his starts. His slider can be an out pitch, though he doesn't always throw it enough. He employs a curveball to get ahead early in counts, and while some have seen a changeup in bullpen sessions, he doesn't use one in games. PERSON wasn't as sharp late in the season, pitching out of the stretch in the state tournament as he was nursing a sprained ankle. A team that believes the right-hander they saw in GPE is the real deal could take him in the top five rounds.",0
"PERSON took a big step forward in 2014, his second season with the ORGANIZATION after coming from the Nationals in the ORGANIZATION trade. As much progress as he showed that season, he regressed in 2015, struggling with command and moving to the bullpen. He did have a bit more success as a reliever and had a short, unsuccessful big league debut. His 2016 campaign was short-lived due to shoulder issues. Even so, the ORGANIZATION liked his arm strength, and they got him from the ORGANIZATION for PERSON at the non-waiver PERSON. If he can return to health, PERSON still has premium velocity, with his upper-90s fastball coming from his 6-foot-9 frame getting on hitters quickly. He did try to dial it back at times last year in order to find the strike zone more consistently. When he's on his game, he misses bats and gets groundball outs thanks to the heavy sink on his heater. His power breaking ball is still a plus pitch and can put away hitters. In 2014, his changeup had improved to be a third very viable weapon, but it was inconsistent at best during his struggles.PERSON will be 27 in 2017, with his best bet to contribute at the big league level will be as a reliever. The big right-hander will have to show he's healthy and throw more strikes in order to be successful.",0
"GPE has plus raw power and a chance to stay on the infield in some capacity, but not at shortstop. A move will necessitate more contact, but the power potential makes GPE enticing.",1
"GPE's breakout season in 2015 led to his Major League debut, where he performed well in a small sample size. He had the chance to earn full-time status but struggled in GPE when given the chance in 2016, though he did right the ship in Triple-A despite having to deal with some injury-related absences. The injuries continued in 2017, as a dislocated finger suffered while diving into home plate during Spring Training ended his chances of making the D-backs' Opening Day roster.GPE has the tools, the makeup and the approach to succeed at the highest level. He's been a slow starter in the past, and the hope is that's what occurred in GPE last April. A broken toe knocked him out of action and didn't allow him to get into any kind of rhythm. Prior to last year, his hitting ability was steadily improving as he cut his strikeout rate, but the swing-and-miss came back a bit in the big leagues. He has strength, and his ability to re-refine his approach should allow him to tap into his power. A plus runner, he can still improve his basestealing efficiency, and he's shown an ability to use that speed well in all three outfield positions, where his strong arm plays well.Just 24 for nearly all of the 2017 season, GPE could get another opportunity to show he can handle the highest level once he's healthy. He has the tools to be an everyday outfielder. At the very least, he could be an extremely productive fourth outfielder on a 25-man roster.",1
"GPE is an advanced receiver with advanced contact skills. He had a growth spurt in his late teens but still needs to add some strength and power to profile as anything more than contact-oriented backup.
",0
"PERSON was acquired from GPE in 2017 as one third of the ORGANIZATION' return for PERSON, along with PERSON and J.D. PERSON, both 35 FV type prospects. PERSON is just a touch above that level, despite being a somewhat generic right-handed depth starter. PERSON has three average-to-slightly-above pitches that can flash 55 at moments due to his feel for pitching. It isn't swing-and-miss stuff, and is probably more middle reliever or spot starter than rotation stalwart given pitcher attrition, but he has plus makeup, knows how to pitch, and should be in Double-A next year.",0
"GPE ORGANIZATION never has had more than one player selected in the first five rounds of a Draft but could have three in June. PERSON and first baseman PERSON have posted strong offensive numbers for three years, while PERSON was the ORGANIZATION's 2019 pitcher of the year. He set GPE records for single-season strikeouts (124 in 83 innings through the regular season) and consecutive scoreless innings (31 entering the conference tournament).PERSON is just 5-foot-11 but produces 88-93 mph fastballs and tops out at 95 with a combination of arm speed and an effortful delivery. His best pitch is his curveball, a plus offering in the upper 70s with 12-6 break when at its best. He also can display a decent changeup but struggles with his feel for the pitch.PERSON' size, mechanics and inconsistent command have him pointed to the bullpen in pro ball. Working in shorter stints, he could have two plus pitches with a harder fastball and curve. He may get an opportunity to prove what he can do as a starter, but he could accelerate quickly to the big leagues as a reliever.",0
"PERSON doesn't throw hard--he sits 88-91 with a pretty straight fastball--but he's big and gets excellent extension down the mound, adding over two ticks of perceived velocity to his heater. He also knows how to operate up in the zone with his fastball, with good enough command to do it on the corners, and pair it with a big-breaking curveball, mixing in some changeups to keep hitters honest. There's a chance for a unique backend starter, especially if the velocity comes a little more, but it's more likely PERSON becomes a spot starter or long reliever given the limited margin for error with which he operates.",0
"PERSON was an afterthought in the 2012 Draft, a 21st-rounder who signed for $2,500 after recording an 8.40 ERA as a ORGANIZATION Military Institute senior. Yet he was a revelation in his first full pro season, averaging 11.7 strikeouts per nine innings in low Class A -- a rate that would have led the LOCATION League if he hadn't been a few innings short of qualifying. When the FACILITY moved PERSON from the bullpen to the rotation in late July, he responded by going 4-1 with a 1.58 ERA in seven starts.PERSON can miss bats with both his fastball and slider. He can run his fastball from 88-96 mph with cutting action, and his sharp slider reaches the mid-80s. PERSON's changeup gives him a reliable third offering.With his big 6-foot-5 frame, PERSON does a nice job of creating plane and angle on his pitches, making him more difficult to hit. His control and command improved after he transitioned to starting, and GPE will keep him in that role going forward. The FACILITY thought PERSON might not need much more than another year in the Minors, but offseason knee surgery and elbow issues had prevented him from pitching in a game before the All-Star break.",0
"91-93 with tail, above-average curvebal. PERSON has long hook in the back, but stuff portends relief, at least.",0
"As explosive as any high school outfielder in the draft, ORGANIZATION is a nearly elite runner with a plus arm and should grow into above average, strength-driven raw power. His swing can get long and stiff and not all scouts are sold on his bat.",0
"If not for suffering a left ORGANIZATION tear during a rundown in early May, PERSON, who had a 23-game hit streak at the time, probably would have debuted in 2018 due to PERSON's middle infield woes. Instead, PERSON missed much of the season and is on track for a likely 2019 debut. He'll be the first native GPE to play in the majors. PERSON was acquired (along with PERSON) as part of a lopsided package for PERSON. His elite hand-eye coordination and bat control drive a contact-oriented offensive profile. Since coming over from GPE, PERSON has thickened his once frail-looking frame and improved upon some of the things that limited his in-game power. He was rotating better early in 2018, with the timing of his hip/hand spearation being better, too, and he was no longer ditching his leg kick with two strikes. His 2016 GPE and 2017-2018 ORGANIZATION slugging outputs are probably cariacatures of his true talent level, but PERSON should at least have doubles power. Defensively, PERSON is passable at shortstop and second base. He saw time in center field during the 2016 Fall League but hasn't played there since. Lots of scouts like him as a super utility type, but PERSON will be 25 in July and he hasn't played anywhere other than the middle infield at any point in his career, save for that Fall League. It's more likely he gets a chance to be PERSON's everyday shortstop in 2019 and, provided he hasn't lost a step due to the ORGANIZATION tear, we like him as a low-end regular there. ",0
"  PERSON graduated a semester early from PERSON (Fla.) and enrolled at GSP in 2012, bypassing the GPE in the process. He'll be eligible for the first time this year, and he shouldn't have to wait long to hear his name. PERSON has established himself as a solid all-around catcher in his three years at GSP. He is a capable, durable receiver with an average arm and a quick release.  PERSON is a switch-hitter and has a quick, compact swing from both sides of the plate. He has some pop now, but scouts think his swing portends average power in the future. Because he graduated from high school early, he is one of the youngest college players in the GPE class.",0
"A bat-first high school catcher who was considered a long shot to stay behind the plate, PERSON has made sufficient developmental progress as a defender and now projects to stay back there. Always in possession of a strong throwing arm, his once thick frame is now learner and more agile, enabling him to better handle the athletic burdens of catching. He also has huge raw power that he doesn't often get to in games because PERSON's bat path causes him to drive the ball into the ground at a 50% clip and he's also prone to swing and miss. Now that PERSON's defensive future is more in focus, he may just be a swing tweak away from a statistical breakout. ",0
"PERSON PERSON went third overall in the 1985 Draft before winning 142 games during a 16-year big league career. His son could go even higher in the Draft in 2019, as he's the consensus top prep prospect available. He performed well at several prominent 2018 events, winning the ORGANIZATION at the All-Star Game and claiming ORGANIZATION honors at the Under PERSON All-America Game, the ORGANIZATION and the 18-and-under PERSON in GPE. PERSON named him its 2019 national high school player of the year.A rare potential five-tool shortstop, PERSON didn't always make consistent contact on the showcase circuit last summer but scouts aren't worried about his bat. The right-handed hitter shows good barrel control and some willingness to use the entire field, so he could hit for average if he modifies his aggressive approach. His raw power and speed are both plus tools, which, combined with his baserunning instincts, could make him a 20-20 player.PERSON covers plenty of ground at shortstop, has quick hands and possesses the arm strength to make all the necessary throws -- as well as pump mid-90s fastballs from the mound. His love for the game is evident, and scouts praise his makeup as much as his physical ability. He'll turn 19 shortly after the 2019 Draft, making him old for his class and sophomore-eligible in '21 in the unlikely event he follows through on his commitment to GPE.",0
"When high school pitchers from GPE are discussed, PERSON gets most of the attention in this ORGANIZATION class, but PERSON, a lefty from eastern PA, was generating plenty of his own buzz as the ORGANIZATION approached.The PERSON commit jumped up ORGANIZATION boards this spring as the weather finally improved in the LOCATION, coming out firing fastballs up to 93-94 mph with some sink. The velocity backed up a little as the spring wore on, but the still sat in the 90-92 mph range. His curve has the potential to be a future out pitch with excellent downward action. He shows some feel for the changeup and it, too, has the chance to be a Major League average pitch. PERSON and powerfully built, PERSON will have to work to not get too stiff or muscle-bound, which impacts his ability to control the baseball. PERSON has first-round potential. PERSON doesn't have as much ceiling as his ORGANIZATION State contemporary, but a future as a mid-rotation starter could get him off the board in the top few rounds.",0
"PERSON was a pop-up PERSON prospect in 2015 as a closer at ORGANIZATION who set the ORGANIZATION single-season saves record. The D-backs took him in the sixth round of that June's PERSON and decided to try to let him develop as a starter. He didn't take to it as much as hoped, so now he's back in the bullpen. While he is a bit of an undersized right-hander, his clean delivery and potential for a three-pitch mix made the organization think PERSON could work out of a rotation. His stuff backed up in the role, but the year spent trying it out will certainly make him a better pitcher. In shorter stints, his fastball touched 94-95 mph consistently, and he complemented it with a slider that flashed plus at times when he landed it for strikes. He incorporates a good splitter as well, and while he doesn't have pinpoint command, he throws more than enough strikes, especially coming out of the bullpen. After throwing over 100 innings in his year as a starter, PERSON has a better feel for his pitches and understanding of his delivery. His stuff isn't strong enough to close like he did in college, but he could have a future as a setup man.",0
"The way teams value PERSON depends on whether or not they feel confident the ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION will re-write service academy athlete policy. PERSON, PERSON must complete two years of GPE service. This administration may reinstate an Obama-era rule that allows athletes to petition for an exemption to pursue sports. If that rule were currently in place, PERSON would go in the top 50. He throws hard, attacks hitters with his fastball and slider, and will mix in the occasional knee-buckling, rainbow curveball. If teams think PERSON will have to serve and thus won't be able to pitch again until he's 24, he'll fall to Day 3.",0
"When he was coming out of high school, PERSON was a slightly built shortstop with a strong arm. Lightly recruited, he ended up at ORGANIZATION II PERSON, where he played the infield and pitched a little. He served as the team's closer as a sophomore, while still playing short. Then after a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION, he left the infield for the mound full-time and moved into the rotation.While it took a while for PERSON to adjust to the new role, he's begun learning how to maintain his stuff deeper into starts and has helped PERSON be a ORGANIZATION power this spring. It all starts with his live arm that throws fastballs in the 91-96 mph range now that he's filled out some. He'll flash a plus slider with good shape to it, but is still learning how to command the pitch consistently. He has limited feel for his changeup and doesn't use it much, nor does he have to to be successful. He throws plenty of strikes with his fastball, which some feel gives him the chance to start. That might depend on the further development of his secondary stuff, but the gains he's made in a short time have scouts in the area encouraged. He won't go nearly as high, but he reminds some of PERSON, the ORGANIZATION reliever-turned-starter who the ORGANIZATION took in the first round of the 2016 Draft.",0
"After a bit of an up-and-down senior season, PERSON fell to the ORGANIZATION in the second round of the 2012 Draft. Making steady progress up their ladder, the outfielder was having a tremendous 2015 season when he was sent to the ORGANIZATION in the huge ORGANIZATION deal. PERSON drove 22 hours to get to his new home in GPE, promptly picking up two hits in his ORGANIZATION debut.PERSON has an impressive combination of hand quickness and strength at the plate that allows him to drive just about any pitch he sees. That caused some trouble early on, as he was overly aggressive, but the left-handed hitting outfielder has improved his overall approach and plate discipline tremendously. More patience should continue to allow him to use his power more effectively. An above-average runner, PERSON doesn't always use his speed to his fullest advantage. He has the ability to play center field if he applies himself all of the time.PERSON has come a long way since his GPE high school days and it's exciting to think he's still just scratching the surface. Seeing him in an outfield with PERSON soon should also excite ORGANIZATION fans.",1
"GPE likely would have been picked in the early rounds of the 2011 Draft out of high school if he didn't have a seven-figure price tag. The ORGANIZATION took a flier on the southpaw in the 20th round, though, as expected, he instead honored his commitment to GPE. After three consistent seasons as a starter for the GPE, GPE was expected to come off the board in the first three rounds of the 2014 Draft before he sustained an elbow injury in May that ultimately required PERSON surgery. The ORGANIZATION ended up nabbing GPE in the 10th round and then signed him with a $175,000 bonus. At 5-foot-9 and 195 pounds, GPE doesn't have the look of a classic big league starter. However, enough good things can't be said about his stuff and his ability to compete on the mound. He pitches to contact with three offerings that play up because of his ability to locate them on either side of the plate and down in the strike zone.GPE' best pitch is a tight 76-80 mph curveball. His fastball has good sinking action at 88-92 mph, and he'll cut at times to give batters a different look. He also can get outs with his deceptive circle changeup, which he masks nicely with fastball-like arm action. Though he struggled during his 2015 pro debut in the Class A Short PERSON York-Penn League, GPE has come into his own this year in the Class A Advanced PERSON, despite bypassing the Class A level entirely.",0
"After signing for $75,000 as a 19th-rounder out of GPE Interamericana (P.R.) JC in 2015, PERSON batted just .223/.317/.319 in his first two pro seasons. Thus it was a surprise when he won rookie of the year honors in the GPE PERSON last offseason, leading the circuit in on-base percentage (.393) while ranking second in batting (.330) and ORGANIZATION (.806). That momentum carried over into 2017, as he has posted similar numbers in low Class A and emerged as one of the more promising hitters among GPE farmhands.PERSON is continuing to hit for average while beginning to tap into his solid raw power more often this year. To fully realize his upside as a .275 hitter with 15 or more homers per year, he'll need to improve his plate discipline further after beginning to make strides. He also could stand to add some loft to his right-handed stroke because he put the ball in play on the ground too often.PERSON is an asset at third base as well as at the plate. He moves well, has sure hands and owns one of the strongest arms in the system. He has fringy speed and is aggressive on the basepaths.",0
"More than a full year removed from all that intrigue and we still know relatively little about PERSON, largely due to a thumb ligament sprain PERSON dealt with throughout 2018. His signing with PERSON marked the end of a more lucrative era for young international players who are now subject to more tight-fisted rules capping bonus amounts. Despite a limited market due to the timing of his deal, PERSON signed for $26 million thanks to his all-world physical gifts. The raw power and top-end speed were obvious in workouts, but unless teams scouted him in GPE Nacional or during the ORGANIZATION team's annual ORGANIZATION tour, little was known about his ability to hit big league-quality pitching, or what his instincts were like in center field. 
Because his thumb cost him April, May, and July (he re-aggravated it), it was hard to get extended looks during 2018 until PERSON's six-week stint in the ORGANIZATION (which was also interrupted by a hamstring issue). PERSON's ORGANIZATION stats were fine, but his swing path left him vulnerable to velocity on the inner half, and he too often expanded the zone. There's doubt that he'll get to all of his raw power in games, both due to the swing path and lack of plate discipline, but it isn't as if he's had time to make proper adjustments yet, and the pitching he saw in GPE was the best he's seen in his life. The ceiling is the same as it was purported to be before he signed: power, speed, offensive performance similar to PERSON's best years. There's just more risk that PERSON doesn't get there.",0
"Ever since PERSON signed out of the ORGANIZATION for just $90,000 in 2009, he's shown glimpses of very exciting tools. He's been as enigmatic as he's been productive, however, making it a bit tough to evaluate his future.The 2015 season was a microcosm of PERSON's development. The young infielder was hitting for average and decent pop, stealing bases and playing good second base. When he didn't get called up following injuries to PERSON and PERSON, PERSON wasn't happy, and it showed in his performance. PERSON continues to be the key to his inconsistencies. PERSON has the tools to be a top-of-the-order hitter with more extra-base power than you'd expect. He always had the range and hands to play shortstop, his original position, but the mental grind proved to be too much. PERSON is capable of playing good defense on the right side of the infield.PERSON has played second, the outfield and a little bit of third base in Triple-A during the 2016 season while continuing to take ground balls at short, and he did make his big league debut briefly in May. To stick, he might have to break in as a super-utility type. But he'll have to earn his way there and prove he can handle the bright lights of the big leagues.",1
"PERSON's huge junior season at ORGANIZATION enabled him to become one of the best left-handers in the 2014 Draft class and the highest-drafted player ever from the school when the ORGANIZATION took him No. 15 overall. His GPE career was short-lived, however. After pitching across three levels and throwing in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON was the key to the PERSON deal with the ORGANIZATION this offseason.At the time, the trade brought in something PERSON sorely needed: an elite-level pitching prospect, one not that far from helping out in the big leagues. There were readings of PERSON's fastball touching triple digits in 2015 and he'll sit in the 94-97 mph range. Big and physical, he maintains that velocity and does so without too much effort. PERSON's curve has become a plus pitch, one that misses plenty of bats. His changeup gives him a third at least PERSON average offering.PERSON does have to cut down on his walks to reach his ceiling, but as a GPE guy who used to divide focus among two sports, he has more upside than your typical college arm. If the control improves, he could even outperform those Jon Lester comps.",1
"PERSON emerged late in the 2018 draft, first getting national scouting attention in the spring at a high school in the GPE suburbs. He's a prototypical projection prospect, with a great frame, solid average present power, and athletic actions. Scouts who are optimistic see the components of a 45 or 50 hit tool and 60 or more future raw power in an everyday right field profile. Since PERSON is somewhat raw and hasn't faced a lot of high level pitching, there are concerns that the hit tool never materializes enough to get to the rest of his tools.",0
"After helping PERSON to a runner-up finish at the 2016 College World Series, PERSON batted .376 in the ORGANIZATION and would have led the prestigious summer circuit in hitting if he hadn't been a few plate appearances shy of qualifying. He won the Pac-12 Conference batting title (.383) and topped ORGANIZATION Division I with a school-record 30 doubles this spring, establishing himself as one of the best college hitters available in the 2017 PERSON. He signed for a below-slot $700,000 as a supplemental second-round pick gained from the ORGANIZATION as punishment for their hacking scandal.PERSON started to produce more consistently in college when he became more disciplined, working deeper counts and waiting for pitches he could punish. He makes contact almost too easily because it cuts into his walk totals. He's strong and creates plenty of bat speed from the left side of the plate, though he figures to hit more for average than power.While he has an average arm, PERSON lacks speed and quickness, limiting his defensive ability. PERSON used him mostly at first base and ORGANIZATION, while PERSON broke him into pro ball as a left fielder. The ORGANIZATION announced him as a second baseman on PERSON Day and plan to try him there in instructional league.",0
"PERSON broke out in his first taste of full-season ball, winning ORGANIZATION of the Year honors while batting .322/.400/.559 and reaching Double-A in 2012. A persistent sprained right thumb prevented him from putting up a solid encore last season, as his ORGANIZATION plummeted 230 points, and he has yet to regain his form in 2014.Nevertheless, PERSON has the tools to produce at the plate. He has a short stroke and plenty of bat speed, and for a youngster, he does an excellent job of staying back and waiting on offspeed pitches. PERSON added some more loft to his swing in 2013, which should help his power production down the road.PERSON has fringy speed, and he won't be a big basestealing threat, though he has succeeded on 47 of his first 51 steal attempts (92 percent) as a pro. A corner infielder during his first two pro seasons, PERSON has found a home in right field, where he gets the job done and has a solid arm.",0
"PERSON was drafted as a shortstop and then quickly transitioned to the outfield as a professional. His tools and athleticism give him vast potential if he is able to refine his approach at the plate. PERSON is susceptible to good breaking balls and too often swings at pitches out of the zone. If he can become more consistent at the plate, he has a wealth of raw power to tap into. That, combined with his plus speed, could make him an offensive force.  PERSON is much more advanced defensively. He has a solid arm and his speed allows him to effortlessly cover ground in center field. If his bat continues to come around, PERSON could become a solid everyday Major Leaguer.",1
"PERSON's cross-bodied delivery compares closely to that of GPE righty PERSON, as both get way down the mound (PERSON gets nearly 7 feet of extension on his fastballs) and have lower arm slots that make right-handed hitters very uncomfortable. He makes heavy use of a hard slider that at times looks like a cutter. It has enough movement to miss bats if PERSON leaves it in the zone and he's been able to back foot it to lefties. Changeup development is paramount, and a fair number of scouts think PERSON ends up in the bullpen both because his change is quite a bit behind the typical 23-year-old's and because he throws exclusively from the stretch. While that's a possibility, the way PERSON's delivery enables his stuff to play up could make him viable in a multi-inning role. He reached Double-A in 2018 and has a chance to debut in 2019.",0
"GPE by bad ORGANIZATION luck in 2018 (.226), PERSON's repeat tour of Double-A PERSON looked discouraging on paper. He still managed to pound out 27 homers, though, and he remains a strong power/lift/plate discipline prospect who could perform at the big league level soon. Players like this sometimes have seasons in excess of 2 WAR but are generally the type who bounce around the fringes of active rosters, like C.J. PERSON or PERSON.",1
"PERSON served as a troubleshooting reliever on PERSON's PERSON Series club in 2017, the fourth straight year the ORGANIZATION reached PERSON. Though he was extremely valuable in that role, retiring 35 of the 39 batters he faced while recording two wins and a save during the ORGANIZATION postseason, ORGANIZATION shifted him into its rotation this spring. Though his stuff hasn't been as crisp as it has in the past and he missed time with back issues early in the season, he has still shown enough to factor in the first three rounds of the Draft.PERSON has four quality pitches and there's little consensus as to which is his best. He'll flash a well-above-average curveball at times, though there are other times when his hard slider is his superior breaking ball. He doesn't worry about radar guns, working at 89-92 mph with a quality sinker, though he can reach back for 95-96-mph heat when he needs to.As if that's not enough, PERSON can also unveil a solid changeup and fully trusts the pitch. Though he's not big, he's athletic and repeats his delivery, allowing him to throw a ton of strikes and boding well for his durability. He has advanced feel for pitching and mixes his pitches masterfully.",0
"PERSON spent much of 2017 in GPE despite his lack of physicality because he was procedurally advanced for his age, especially on defense. He is athletic, fundamentally sound, and has perhaps the quickest defensive hands in the entire org. At the very least, PERSON projects as an outstanding multi-positional defender, but he also might just be plus at shortstop at maturity and need to play there every day. He also has advanced bat-to-ball skills and even though he has been physically overmatched for about 200 Low-A games over two seasons, he has somehow managed to maintain a strikeout rate in the low teens. PERSON has a little, 5-foot-10 frame and it's not clear whether he'll grow into the kind of physicality that would make him a viable offensive player. If he does, the feel for contact is already in place and he could break out. Though likely a switch-hitting utility man, PERSON has a sneaky chance to be an everyday shortstop.",0
"By some measures, PERSON, who got $1.2 million to sign out of high school as a ninth rounder in the 2011 Draft, had a so-so first taste of Double-A. Considering it was his first full season back from PERSON surgery in May 2014, however, it was a success, and the ORGANIZATION added him to the 40-man roster as a result.PERSON is all about his power sinking fastball. He'll throw it in the low 90s and hitters consistently beat it into the ground, proven by his 2.94 groundout-to-airout ratio in 2016. Both of his secondary pitches, a curve and a changeup, have the chance to be PERSON average, and the breaking ball can miss bats at times, but he needs to land it in the strike zone more consistently. PERSON runs into trouble when he tries to be fine in and around the zone. He falls behind in the count when he doesn't need to, leading to him getting hit more, when all he needs to do is go after hitters early with his sinker and create weak contact early in counts.Officially out of rehab mode, PERSON' confidence could be skyrocketing with his addition to the 40-man roster. When he is efficient and challenges hitters, he has the look of an innings-eating, ground-ball machine.",0
"PERSON was one of the top few pitchers in the class for a while, including all summer. He flashed 55 or 60 with all three pitches in short stints at multiple events, then came out this spring with more arm speed, sitting 93-96 and hitting 97 mph in most of his starts. His curveball also ticked up and flashed 65 or 70 on his best outings, and though he didn't throw his changeup much in high school, it did flash 55 over the summer. PERSON isn't very projectable and is an average athlete, while his command has been consistently below average with this higher octane stuff, so some teams worry this is a classic prep righty bust where clubs fall in love with the raw stuff. His velo would also sit 90-93 at times down the stretch and some teams are worried there could be a minor medical hiccup, which, combined with PERSON's $4 million pricetag and committment to GPE, could make him the second most likely prep player in the draft to go to college behind PERSON.",0
"  An athletic, toolsy outfielder, PERSON impressed in his first full professional season, reaching Double-A Harrisburg and finishing the year in the ORGANIZATION. He returned to both leagues in 2013 and had slightly better results.  PERSON knows how to get on base and, when he's right, uses the whole field to hit. He has worked to simplify his swing, but still has room for improvement, especially against left-handers. PERSON has some good pop, but his best tool is his plus speed. He uses it on the basepaths well and has the look of a future leadoff hitter. Defensively, he is solid in center field and has a good arm.  If PERSON can harness all his athleticism, he has the ability to become the ORGANIZATION center fielder of the future.",0
"PERSON impressed scouts when he starred for GPE at the 18-and-under World Championships in the fall of 2012, but his stock fell when his stuff and delivery took a downturn at the World Baseball Classic the following spring. The ORGANIZATION still signed him for $1,625,000 as part of their 2013 international binge that also included since-traded stud prospects PERSON and PERSON. After PERSON made a successful 2014 pro debut in low Class A, his stuff regressed the next two years before bouncing back in 2017.PERSON's fastball dropped to the upper 80s in 2015-16 before climbing back to 90-93 mph this season. His fastball lacks life but he compensates by locating it well to both sides of the plate. He also has regained consistency with his changeup, his best pitch and a plus offering at its best.His tight curveball gives PERSON another solid secondary pitch. He's not afraid to challenge hitters and generally keeps the ball down in the strike zone, a must for a flyball pitcher with less-than-overpowering stuff. While he doesn't have a huge ceiling, he's one of GPE's more advanced rotation prospects and has a safe floor as a back-of-the-rotation starter.",1
"At 6-foot-2 and close to 220 pounds, PERSON is one of the bigger prospects on the international market this year. He is also one of the best.PERSON has gained a reputation as a pure hitter and is considered the best hitter in the entire class by some evaluators. PERSON already like his plate discipline, and he is expected to improve in that area once he enters a team's academy and plays in games on a regular basis. PERSON has a knack for squaring up the ball and has also displayed the ability to hit for power to all fields during PERSON games.Physically, PERSON has a thick body and tons of raw power, and he has impressed scouts with his overall body strength. He will never be known for his speed on the bases, but his baseball IQ will keep him from running into outs while on the bases. PERSON agree that PERSON's offensive game is ahead of defensive game at the moment, but he has an accurate, above-average throwing arm and is expected to improve in the field with instruction and repetition.From PERSON, GPE, PERSON is trained by PERSON at ORGANIZATION PERSON. The ORGANIZATION are considered the favorite to sign the teenager.",0
" Built like the prototypical GPE right-hander, PERSON was PERSON's Friday night starter this spring. His inconsistent results in that role didn't stop the Nationals from selecting him with their first pick of the 2013 Draft. Despite spending four years in college, PERSON is something of a project. He has a four-pitch arsenal, but is still more of a thrower than a pitcher. He throws his fastball in the mid-90s, but struggles to control it at times. He also throws a curveball, changeup and slider, all of which need more development. Scouts think PERSON profiles better in the bullpen, where his fastball would play up and he could concentrate on one off-speed pitch. For now, however, the Nationals are letting him develop as a starter.",0
"The ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON in the 17th round out of a GPE high school, and he might have gone in the top five rounds if he hadn't been determined to pitch with his older brother PERSON at ORGANIZATION State. After a season with the the 49ers, PERSON spent one year each pitching with his twin brother PERSON at ORGANIZATION (Calif.) CC, where they won a state championship in 2014, and at FACILITY. A fourth-round pick last June, PERSON signed for $550,000.PERSON can reach 95 mph with his fastball but usually operates at 90-92 mph with a two-seamer that plays up because of its sink and his ability to command it. While his low-80s slider shows flashes of becoming a solid offering at times, he gets around it and turns it into a less effective slurve at others. He also needs more consistency with his splitter/changeup, though he trusts the pitch and can get swings and misses with it.PERSON has a compact delivery that he repeats well, allowing him to pound the bottom of the strike zone. His lack of a true plus pitch likely limits his ceiling to that of a No. 4 starter, but he's a good bet to reach it. The ORGANIZATION like the way he competes and also think he could become a seventh-inning reliever if needed.",0
"PERSON has advanced quickly since the ORGANIZATION made him a fourth-round pick in 2013, playing in Double-A and PERSON last year at age 20. ORGANIZATION officials hail him as one of the smartest players and best leaders in their farm system, and his makeup and his game resemble those of former All-Star Walt Weiss.With quick feet and hands to go with solid arm strength, PERSON stands out more for his defense than his offense. He made 35 errors in 2015, up from 22 the year before, but GPE believes that he'll develop into a steady gloveman. He also has seen action at second base and eventually could be pushed there by PERSON, PERSON or PERSON Garcia.PERSON employs a contact approach from the left side of the plate, recognizing that he's not a power hitter and focusing on getting on base. He runs well and has a chance to make it as a No. 2 hitter, though he'll more likely fit toward the bottom of a lineup. He won't ever hit a lot of home runs, but he has added strength and began using his legs more in his swing during offseason work.",1
"PERSON was an upside, cold-weather hitter to watch in the 2018 draft class but he exceeded expectations in the spring, rising into discussions for the middle of the first round. He landed near the top of a group of top-tier toolsy outfielders, flashing plus raw power, speed, and arm strength. He also went on a tear down the stretch in the ORGANIZATION state playoffs when high-level scouts were coming in for looks, hitting homer after homer. Some scouts were still uncertain about PERSON's ultimate upside, arguing that his style of hitting indicates a swing flaw. To possess premium bat speed and face pitching in the 80s and still hit opposite field homers indicates PERSON was late on subpar stuff, and his deep hand load (which helps create the power) means this approach and his ultimate upside might not work in pro ball. While it's too early to pass judgment on that opinion, PERSON struggled against good pitching in his pro debut and in instructional league, often exhibiting poor timing and ending up late on good fastballs. The Rays aren't worried -- expectations for cold-weather hitters are close to nil in their pro debut, not only because of the big jump in competition but also because they're playing the longest season of their lives. PERSON may start 2019 in extended spring training so the org can keep a close eye on his habits and challenges in a controlled environment, but his upside is still among the best in his draft class.",0
"After going undrafted out of high school, PERSON spent the 2016 season at ORGANIZATION (Fla.) JC, where he showed dynamic athleticism and tools but produced uneven results. The ORGANIZATION still made him their 11th round pick that June, and he signed for $400,000.Much like they did with 2015 second-rounder PERSON, the ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON with the intention of making him a switch-hitter. He's impressed the club with his aptitude in learning to hit from the left side, but, overall, he's a bit of a project at the plate. PERSON's elite speed is a weapon, both in center field and on the basepaths, but he needs to improve his basestealing technique. PERSON also has a well above-average arm, especially for center field. Team officials rave about PERSON's athleticism, speed and promising hitting ability, and the belief is that he'll eventually develop the necessary baseball skills.",0
"Will the real PERSON please stand up? A star at FACILITY, PERSON entered pro ball as a first-round pick who was an advanced college performer at the plate, one who could hit for average and get on-base and he fit that profile during his first full season. When he got to Double-A for year two, however, he tapped into his raw power consistently, but at the expense of his hit tool. He capped off a year that saw him lead the organization in home runs and ORGANIZATION with a strong performance in the ORGANIZATION League.Few doubted that the big, strong PERSON had power to tap into as a professional, but they also knew that he wasn't focusing on that part of his game, instead relying on his ability to work counts and make contact. His decision to work on driving the ball did lead to run production, but also saw his strikeout rate go up and his walk rate diminish. The ORGANIZATION aren't overly upset that he's likely more power over hit now because, as an at least below-average runner, singles and walks aren't quite as effective.As PERSON changed his offensive profile for power, he was also working on his defense at first base, where it now looks like he'll be a solid defender with good hands and a strong arm. There's a chance PERSON could find a balance between his old and new selves at the plate, but the ORGANIZATION would be happy to see that kind of power production from the infield corner spot moving forward.",0
"A bit of an enigma in college, PERSON dominated in the ORGANIZATION and PERSON college leagues during the summers but bounced between roles while battling his control during the springs at FACILITY A&M. He opened 2017 in the GPE bullpen before moving to the rotation in late March, pitching well until he tired in June. Drafted in the second round with a pick the ORGANIZATION received from the ORGANIZATION as punishment for the hacking scandal, he signed for a below-slot $1 million.PERSON worked with a 95-96 mph fastball and peaked at 98 as a Cape reliever, and he dialed it down to 91-95 to throw more strikes as a starter during the spring. His curveball can be just as overpowering, featuring both power and depth, and he also can miss bats with his mid-80s slider. He also exhibits some feel for a changeup that could develop into another solid offering as he uses it more often.There's no question that PERSON has enough pitches to make it as a starter. Recruited as a two-way player out of high school, he has athleticism that should help his control and durability. If he can't command his pitches well enough to stick in the rotation, he has late-inning upside as a reliever.",1
"PERSON caught the attention of scouts when he hit 98 mph as a freshman in LOCATION, but he went just 8-17 in three seasons with the ORGANIZATION and lasted five rounds in the 2014 Draft. He recorded a 2.82 ERA in his first two full seasons as a pro starter, but struggled in a return to Double-A last year and moved to the bullpen in GPE. He made just six relief appearances before blowing out his elbow and having PERSON surgery that sidelined him for most of the 2018 season.After working at 92-95 mph with sink on his fastball as a starter, PERSON flashed upper-90s heat in his brief foray as a reliever last year. His mid-80s slider/cutter should play as a plus pitch more consistently in shorter stints. He has made progress with a sinking changeup, though it may never be more than an average offering and he won't use it much coming out of the bullpen.Though the ORGANIZATION have helped PERSON calm down his delivery since college, his walk rate has risen at every level as he has climbed through the Minors. He still could project as a No. 4 starter if he could improve his changeup and his command, but banking on his pair of power pitches and his competitiveness as a reliever is more realistic.",0
"PERSON showed well in GPE's rotation as a sophomore but was unable to make progress the next year, spending much of the season in the bullpen with underwhelming results. The ORGANIZATION selected him in the 23rd round that June, and he pitched at both Class A levels during his full-season debut before advancing to Double-A in 2016 and making his big league debut early in the '17 season.A physically strong right-hander, PERSON pitches with a plus fastball that sits 94-96 mph and touches 97 with late sinking action that has resulted in strong ground-ball rates throughout his career. His low-80s slider plays well against right-handed hitters thanks to its depth and tilt, at times flashing above average, though his overall consistency with the pitch leaves much to be desired. PERSON holds his own against lefties in spite of his lack of a changeup, but he may need to add the pitch to his arsenal in order to retire them at the highest level.PERSON has the ability to work more than one inning, which he did in 23 of his 48 appearances (including four starts) in 2016. That stamina could make him a long reliever in the big leagues, though he does have the potential for a greater role if he can improve his slider and fastball command.",0
" While the ORGANIZATION used some of their young pitching depth in trades during the offseason, that didnât leave that cupboard bare. As long as everyone can be patient, PERSON may help fill the void quite nicely. The nephew of former big league reliever PERSON, he will be just 18 years old for all of the 2013 season. PERSON has a plus fastball that can touch the mid-90s and he commands it pretty well. His slider will be solid in the future, though itâs a bit inconsistent right now and he has a better feel for a changeup than most teenagers. His overall command and pitchability is advanced for his age, which should enable him to continue to be young for his level, even if heâs developed cautiously.",1
"An intriguing two-way prospect and athlete, PERSON had middling tools on both sides of the ball but had one of the biggest, most projectable frames in the draft. PERSON hoped he'd emerge during his junior spring, but PERSON fractured his elbow early in the season and was done for the year. He'll be a tough sign, but teams who think he could be a true two-way player may be motivated to pay him. He'll sit in the upper-80s on the mound and has a great curveball. Offensively, PERSON already has considerable power and will likely grow into more. He's also a massive, athletic target at first base.",0
"PERSON was a well-known Atlanta-area prep prospect, who in high school was a strong statistical performer with easy plus raw power that showed up in games. He didn't have a clear positional fit as an amateur, and that's still mostly the case now--he was a shortstop in high school but wasn't an athletic fit there, tried catching but it didn't work, and scouts generally projected third base or first base long term. Though he has mostly played third, pro scouts see PERSON as a first base-only type, and he started seeing time there during the 2017 Fall League and again late in 2018. He missed much of 2018 with an 80-game ORGANIZATION suspension, which ominously came after a breakout 2017 campaign during which he hit 31 homers. He has now reached Triple-A, and had a strong half-season after the suspension was up, but scouts are wary of being all-in on a player whose entire profile is dependent on power and has also had a recent ORGANIZATION suspension. One-dimensional hitters who are limited on defense tend to end up in a first base platoon (and in this case, it'd be the lesser side of one) or as a low-end starter like PERSON. Either way, it seems unlikely a high-payroll, contending club like GPE would wait for a young player with limited upside to break in as an everyday player. We think PERSON is a low-end regular and that he may be trade bait once he further establishes his level of performance post-suspension.",1
"The ORGANIZATION ace entered his junior season billed as the most advanced college pitcher in the class and he didn't disappoint, finishing among the ORGANIZATION Division I leaders in a host of pitching categories. That led to the Phillies taking him with the ORGANIZATION. 7 overall pick in the GPE. He signed quickly and made his professional debut all the way up in the ORGANIZATION State League.ORGANIZATIONt the biggest right-hander in the world, PERSON has tremendous command of his three-pitch mix. His fastball sits in the low 90s and appears even faster thanks to his low three-quarters arm slot. He locates to both sides and throws his fastball with plenty of sink. His changeup is plus at times and he throws his breaking ball for strikes at any point in the count.Among the 2014 pitching crop, PERSON is the best bet to reach his ceiling and likely will be the first starter to appear in the big leagues.",1
"After a year of sitting 90-94, GPE's fastball velocity fluctuated pretty significantly both start-to-start and within individual games, often resting in the upper-80s like it did while he was in college. But he was also up to 95 at times, even reaching back for that kind of heat late in his starts. Some of the drop in velocity may have been artificial, a result of GPE working more on sinking and cutting his fastball rather than just throwing it hard. He's a plus on-mound athlete who we anticipate will be a sinker/changeup No. 4 or 5 starter relatively soon. His season ended in mid-July due to an oblique strain.",0
" It's becoming fairly clear that PERSON is the type of guy who just plain hits. He may not profile well in any particular spot, but it's been said more than once that guys who hit get to the big leagues. He has a short, quick swing from the left side of the plate and shows the ability to make adjustments that could allow him to be an above-average hitter. He has more doubles/gap power, though there's the chance that he could maybe get to average power once he's big league ready. He's a fringy runner, at best, but his instincts have made him an excellent baserunner. He's played both outfield corners and while he doesn't fit the power profile for that, he doesn't have the speed and range to play center field every day. But he's a real gamer who comes to play every day, the type who'll be sure to maximize the tools he does have to overachieve.",1
"PERSON starred at ORGANIZATION State PERSON for three years before going to the A's with ORGANIZATION. 25 overall pick in the 2014 Draft and signing for $1.75 million. A knee injury delayed the start of his first full season until May, and he missed most of the final two months while on the disabled list with an ailing wrist. That didn't keep PERSON from a breakout campaign, though, as he paced the A's system with 23 home runs despite playing only 80 games at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Stockton. PERSON has continued to showcase his huge power this season in the ORGANIZATION, and it would be a surprise if he didn't blow past his 2015 total in that department. PERSON's loud physical tools highlight his high-end combination of strength and athleticism. The right-handed hitter has some swing-and-miss to his game and will need to do a better job controlling the strike zone as he moves up the ladder, but he makes a lot of hard contact with a line-drive oriented swing, and he impressed with his feel for using the whole field last year during his time in the GPE. The power plays to all fields, too, thanks to his quick bat and his significant extension through point of contact, the combination of which could make him a 20-homer threat annually once fully developed.PERSON is a plus defender at third base with excellent hands and smooth actions as well as plus-plus arm strength that ranks among the best in the Minors at the position. Though his ultimate impact will depend on the development of his hit tool, PERSON's defense, along with his power potential, could still help him achieve an everyday role in the big leagues.",1
"GPE underwent PERSON surgery during his sophomore year at GPE and didn't return to the mound until '14. The ORGANIZATION made him their fourth-round pick that June, and then limited his workload in his pro debut. GPE was dealt to the PERSON in a deal for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION Deadline the following year, and then impressed his new organization with a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION State League in 2016. A minor shoulder injury stemming from his time in the ORGANIZATION delayed the start of his 2017 campaign, but GPE's stuff has looked better than ever since beginning his season in June.GPE's arm strength is among the best in GPE's system, as he'll operate at 95-98 mph with late arm-side run that makes him difficult to square up. The right-hander complements his heater with a sharp, low-80s slider that flashes above average, and he also exhibits some feel for throwing a changeup.The PERSON will continue to develop GPE as a starter, but given his injury history, as well as his fastball-slider pairing and below-average control, the right-hander may ultimately assume a late-inning bullpen role.",0
"Yet another prospect unearthed at an GPE junior college by the ORGANIZATION, PERSON batted .439/.545/.849 with more homers (20) than strikeouts (18) at ORGANIZATION in 2016. PERSON inside and outside of the organization believe he's one of the better all-around hitters in the ORGANIZATION system. He set career highs in most categories last season and continued to open eyes by ranking third in the ORGANIZATION in on-base percentage (.463), slugging (.561) and ORGANIZATION (1.023). A switch-hitter, PERSON has a better stroke and more power from the left side. Following a homerless pro debut, he started using his legs better in his swing and homered 31 times in his first two full seasons. He's a better hitter than his .248 career average might indicate, making repeated hard contact and drawing a healthy amount of walks.PERSON has a plus arm and reliable hands at third base, though he lacks quickness and has fringy range. He caught some at ORGANIZATION and in his first full season, but his bat was much more advanced than his receiving so the ORGANIZATION decided to focus on the former. He also played second base during the low Class A ORGANIZATION playoffs in 2017.",1
"A star quarterback in high school, PERSON excelled as a reliever at GPE, compiling a 1.88 ERA in three seasons and ranking fourth in ORGANIZATION Division I with 16 saves in 2016. He gave the Ducks a reliever taken in the top 10 round for the fourth straight year -- following PERSON (D-backs), PERSON (Twins) and PERSON (GPE) -- and signed for a slightly below-slot $250,000 as a sixth-rounder. He had earned a mid-season promotion during his first full year when he was sent to the ORGANIZATION right before the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION deal.PERSON has more pitches than a typical reliever, using two versions of a fastball and both a slider and a cutter. He can sink a two-seam fastball in the low 90s and has more success with a four-seamer that reaches 96 mph and has an excessive spin rate that allows it to dodge bats up in the strike zone. Both his mid-80s slider and upper-80s cutter can be plus pitches at times, and he also can mix in a changeup with some fade.PERSON's control of his pitches fluctuates at times, but he generally throws enough strikes to keep himself out of trouble. The ORGANIZATION didn't hesitate to promote him, and if he continues to miss bats, he could continue to move quickly in the ORGANIZATION' system.",1
"PERSON PERSON in GPE has had its fair share of talent come through its ranks, from 2004 first-rounder PERSON to 2011 sixth-rounder PERSON. Now it's PERSON's turn.PERSON has the chance to have three Major League average or better offerings from a strong and athletic pitcher's frame. His fastball will sit in the 91-92 mph range, with good movement, and he can reach back for a little extra. His sharp slider has the chance to be a strikeout pitch in the future, and he keeps his changeup down in the zone with good arm speed and deception.PERSON has good mound presence and has a good idea of what he's doing on the mound. That's not a huge surprise considering that if he doesn't go pro, he's headed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE to play for his father, PERSON.",0
"PERSON didn't enter the spring of 2013 with much fanfare, and his teammate PERSON was considered to be PERSON's best Draft-eligible pitcher. That quickly changed as PERSON's fastball was regularly clocked up to 100 mph and he jumped into the conversation for the top overall pick before settling at ORGANIZATION. 3 overall with the Rockies.PERSON has excellent size for a right-hander, and he uses it to generate easy velocity. He throws his fastball in the mid- to upper 90s. His slider is his best offspeed pitch and he also throws a solid changeup. PERSON displayed impressive command in his professional debut and pitches well off his fastball.It didn't take long for PERSON to reach PERSON after signing, then went right to Double-A for his full-season debut. He has the stuff to become a front-line starter.",1
"The FACILITY saw enough of GPE after he threw sparingly as a reliever in four years at ORGANIZATION to sign him for $50,000 in the 16th round of the 2011 Draft, and they converted him to a starter in the middle of his first full pro season and watched him lead the system with 138 strikeouts in 2013. He didn't start his 2014 season until mid-July because of a broken hand suffered in an off-field incident. He did come back to make his Major League debut, making six appearances -- five of them starts -- late in the year, before finishing things off with a strong stint as a reliever in the ORGANIZATION. The A's got him as part of the package they received in return for PERSON in December.GPE has streamlined and sped up his delivery since turning pro, allowing him to get more leverage out of his 6-foot-5 frame. That helped him add velocity, and he now sits at 91-93 mph and touches 95 with his fastball. GPE's heater is his lone plus pitch, so he has a ceiling of a back-of-the-rotation starter and may wind up back in the bullpen down the road. His fringy changeup is his best secondary offering, and he struggles at times to stay on top of his curveball and slider. There's some effort in GPE's delivery, costing him some command.",0
"A two-way player as a ORGANIZATION freshman before becoming a full-time hitter, PERSON led the Flames to their first ORGANIZATION regional final in 2013 before signing for $100,000 as an 11th-rounder. He totaled 31 homers and 41 steals in his first two full pro seasons, though he batted just .217/.263/.335 after he reached Double-A last June. He fared better in his return to that level in 2016, only to be traded to the ORGANIZATION in early September as the ORGANIZATION in the deal that sent PERSON and PERSON to PERSON at the ORGANIZATION.  PERSON showed some of the best all-around tools in the ORGANIZATION' system and has a chance to be average or better across the board. He has the bat speed and strength to hit for power, and he showed the feel for hitting and sound approach to produce solid batting averages when he was in the lower Minors. PERSON didn't control his swing or the strike zone as well against more advanced pitchers in Double-A last year, though his ability to make adjustments when he returned there bodes well for his future. PERSON has plus speed that helps him steal bases and cover ground in the outfield. He has played six positions as a pro, getting time at third base and shortstop last year because PERSON had a void in high Class A. PERSON had the arm and quickness but lacked the actions for the infield, and he played the outfield exclusively in 2016, with a majority of his starts coming in center field.",0
"Originally a second-round pick of the ORGANIZATION out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks in 2013, PERSON was part of the package the ORGANIZATION got from GPE in return for PERSON in December 2014. His first full season was marred by a bus accident while playing in the ORGANIZATION that forced him out of action for a few weeks, but he bounced back with a strong 2016. He was on the cusp of being big league ready when a hamate injury knocked him out for a couple of months to start 2017.PERSON has some legitimate pop in his bat from the right side of his plate when 100 percent, emanating from a whip of a swing, and should provide at least 15 homers annually. There is some swing and miss, but as his approach continues to improve, so does his overall hit tool. A third baseman when he first began his pro career, the ORGANIZATION moved him to the outfield and he's grown more comfortable, playing an athletic left field.The younger brother of ORGANIZATION prospect D.J. PERSON, PERSON is at the ORGANIZATION' highest level at age 22, waiting for his first callup. ORGANIZATION fans will be sure to love his energy and passion for playing the game.",1
"Some scouts believe PERSON could be the most advanced hitter from GPE in this year's class, and that's saying a lot.Evaluators like what they have seen so far from PERSON on both sides of the ball, but as with most prospects his age, there is still room for improvement, especially on defense. That said, the teenager has all of the ingredients to become an average catcher in the future, and he is expected to improve on all parts of his game once he signs and enters a team's academy. Some scouts are picturing a young PERSON McCann.There's no disputing PERSON's makeup. He has a high baseball IQ and has exhibited leadership qualities. What's more, PERSON has shown the type of high aptitude and character that evaluators love, and those traits point to a bright future behind the plate.PERSON is from GPE, GPE, and trains with PERSON. The ORGANIZATION are considered the favorite to sign him.",1
"Few college players in the 2018 Draft can match PERSON's youth (he won't turn 21 until September) and track record. He cracked PERSON's LOCATION rotation as a freshman, became its No. 1 starter as a sophomore and performed well in the ORGANIZATION and with PERSON during his two summers. Though his velocity has been down this spring, he still should fit somewhere in the first two rounds.PERSON could have three solid or better pitches when all is said and done. After touching 96 mph in the past, he's working more at 88-91 and topping out at 93, but his fastball is still effective because he uses his 6-foot-3 frame and a high three-quarters arm slot to deliver it on a steep downhill plane. He trusts his advanced changeup more than his slider, which can get slurvy at ORGANIZATION's stuff, strong frame and competitiveness could make him an innings-eating No. 3 or 4 starter. Prone to occasional lapses of control in previous years, he has pounded the strike zone better than ever this spring. He'll need to watch his conditioning to reach his potential.",0
"PERSON loved ORGANIZATION' athleticism and arm strength when he was coming out of high school in GPE in 2011, but his size contributed to him lasting until the ORGANIZATION took him in the 26th round. He drew some interest from college football programs as a quarterback before deciding to focus on pitching at ORGANIZATION. Three years later, ORGANIZATION signed for $510,000 as a third-rounder.ORGANIZATION has a quick arm that produces 92-94 mph fastballs that top out at 97 mph. He can throw the ball by hitters up in the strike zone, or he can induce groundouts in the lower part of the zone. ORGANIZATION' hard slider shows some promise, while his changeup is a work in progress.While ORGANIZATION' size leads to questions about his durability, he helps his cause by filling the strike zone and keeping his pitch counts down. ORGANIZATION maintains his velocity into the late innings, so he could become a No. 3 or 4 starter if he can refine his secondary pitches.",0
"A few years ago, PERSON was considered one of the best left-handed pitching prospects in the game, ranking No. 13 overall on MLB.com's Top 100 Prospects list heading into 2012. PERSON surgery cost the then-Yankee much of 2012 and all of 2013. GPE dealt him to the ORGANIZATION following the 2014 season, and he made his big league debut in July 2015. His 2016 season was interrupted by elbow soreness, and when the ORGANIZATION designated him for assignment and then released him in GPE, the ORGANIZATION decided to give him another chance.Back at the height of his prospect status, PERSON was touching 97 mph with his fastball. That velocity hasn't come all the way back, as he sits more around 90-91 mph. He may not need it to fully return, thanks in part to improvement in his changeup. He throws it with terrific arm speed and has good action to it, making it an above-average pitch. He can use his curve to get strikes early in counts, and his recently-added slider/cutter that can have good, sharp bite could develop into more of an out pitch. All of this hinges, of course, on PERSON being able to stay healthy. He still has the chance to find success on a big league staff in some capacity if he can ever put the arm woes permanently behind him.",1
"One of the top young pitching prospects to leave the island, the right-hander was the ORGANIZATION of the Year during the 2013-14 season. He went 5-5 with a 3.90 ERA during his rookie season, primarily pitching out of the bullpen. He also sported a 2.45 ERA as a reliever during the 2014-15 season.It's his experience pitching successfully at a high level combined with a fastball in the low 90s and a plus curveball that leads some scouts to believe PERSON could be a better prospect than fellow GPE right-hander PERSON, 19, who signed $16 million deal with the Dodgers.PERSON projects as a starter, but some evaluators think he could also have success at the ORGANIZATION level pitching out of the bullpen, possibly as a closer, at least initially.PERSON was selected to represent his country in an international tournament but left his GPE del Rio team during the LOCATION in February in GPE, PERSON. He made his way to GPE, where he eventually established residency in May. He was declared a free agent by PERSON on July 7, making him eligible to sign during the 2015-2016 international signing period that began on July 2.",0
"Discovered in the ORGANIZATION after he slipped under draft radars for various reasons (including an early-career TJ), PERSON was signed as an undrafted free agent and, a year later, has reached theupper-levels of the minors. He has your typical, two-pitch middle relief look.",0
"Some projectable, sits around 90-93 with a two-plane slurve, average stuff that many project to be above average across the board.",0
"In 2017, PERSON made the leap from scout favorite and known toolshed with limited experience in Low-A to one of the top prospects in baseball. He demolished High-A, Double-A and Triple-A as a 19-year-old, performing even better at each level, a near unprecedented performance. He will be the ORGANIZATION starting right or left fielder (in deference to PERSON in center) in the first half of 2018 and projects for a peak season of at least 4 wins with about the lowest risk/variance a 20-year-old can offer.",1
"The Phillies have started to sign and develop some very talented young pitching from PERSON, with PERSON and PERSON understandably generating most of the prospect buzz. But the Phillies think PERSON, GPE like PERSON and GPE, has the chance to be in the same conversation as his counterparts.Making a successful jump to full-season ball in 2016 at age 19, PERSON has largely worked in relief, but was slowly getting lengthened out so the Phillies could see what he looks like as a starter. He has the makings of a solid three-pitch mix. He'll throw his fastball in the 90-95 mph range, but it's his above-average slider that is a separator and can be a true out pitch. He's been throwing his changeup more and it's a work in progress, but he should have a feel for it in the future. He has proven to be a quality strike-thrower.Because he's not the biggest right-hander in the world and there is some effort to his delivery, some feel PERSON is destined to be a reliever long-term, where his fastball-slider combination should work well. But it's too soon to rule out the possibility of him developing into a starting option.",1
"The ORGANIZATION have had tremendous early returns converting college relievers from the 2015 (ORGANIZATION) and 2016 (since-traded PERSON) PERSON to pro starters, and they may have a similar success story in GPE, a 2017 fifth-rounder signed for $320,900. He made just four starts in three years at ORGANIZATION, which preferred to use him as a multi-inning reliever. He dealt with a tired arm early in his Draft year but bounced back to win ORGANIZATION honors at the ORGANIZATION USA tournament and recorded a 1.35 ERA in his brief pro debut.GPE has yet to be stretched out as a starter, but as a college reliever and in short pro stints he operated with a 92-95 mph fastball that peaked at 97. His spike curveball can be more devastating and also harder to control, combining power and 12-to-6 break. Both PERSON and PERSON added velocity and maintained it over a full season after shifting to the rotation, and if that happens with GPE he'll have a pair of well above-average pitches.GPE had little reason to use a changeup in college and adding a reliable third pitch will be a focal point of his development. So will improving his control and command after he walked 4.5 batters per nine innings in college. He has a strong frame and his arm works well, so he should be able to hold up as a starter.",0
"One of the best high school position prospects in the 2013 Draft, PERSON saw his chances of going in the first round disappear when he tore the meniscus in his right knee in a season-opening doubleheader. The ORGANIZATION made a serious run at him after selecting him in the 22nd round, but they couldn't divert him from attending PERSON. PERSON continues to draw comparisons to GPE coach PERSON, the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in 1995.PERSON does a nice job of controlling the strike zone and using the opposite field. He has the bat speed and strength to provide average power and shows it during batting practice, though his current approach is geared more to line-drive contact. PERSON has solid speed but isn't as quick as he was in high school, when he set a GPE national 18-and-under team record with five steals in one game.Though he has lost a step, PERSON gets the job done in center field and exhibits good jumps and routes on fly balls. He has a decent arm and makes accurate throws.",0
"The ORGANIZATION selected PERSON in the fourth round of the 2015 GPE, making him the highest-drafted player to come out of GPE. The top ORGANIZATION II prospect in his GPE class, he signed for $484,000, made his pro debut at ORGANIZATION A Short-Season Tri-City and then earned All-Star honors while finishing sixth in the batting race (.320) at ORGANIZATION A Fort Wayne in first full season. He made even greater strides at the plate with PERSON in 2017, when he finished fourth in the GPE League with 22 home runs and third with a .497 slugging percentage. A left-handed hitter with bat speed and strength, PERSON is an offensive-minded backstop who knows how to drive the ball and projects to hit for power and some average. He has a knack for making hard contact to all fields and does a good job controlling the strike zone, though he did experience a nearly 6-percent jump in his strikeout rate with the move up to PERSON Elsinore.While PERSON's large frame continues to raise questions among evaluators about whether he can stay behind the plate long term, club officials were pleased with the progress he made in 2017 after working with catching instructor PERSON. He has decent hands and some raw arm strength, but his receiving skills are below average and he needs to improve his catch-and-throw skills after throwing out just 19.7 percent of attempted basestealers in three professional seasons.",0
"The ORGANIZATION's biggest over-slot signing in the 2012 Draft, PERSON spurned an ORGANIZATION commitment to sign for $1.3 million in the fourth round. He struggled as a starter and when he recorded a 6.08 ERA in Double-A, PERSON made him a full-time reliever in June 2016. He has had more success coming out of the bullpen and has adapted well to Triple-A after getting tagged for a 7.64 ERA in his first taste of that level last summer, increasing his value enough to be included in the trade that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION.PERSON worked with a low-90s fastball and peaked at 96 mph in high school, but his velocity dropped for much of his time as a pro starter. He began throwing harder again after making mechanical adjustments in 2015 and harder still once he moved to the bullpen and worked shorter stints. He operated at 93-98 for much of last season before sitting in the upper 90s and touching 101 mph in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON's fastball isn't as overpowering as it seems because it straightens out and he doesn't command it consistently. He can miss bats with a circle changeup that features splitter action but never has come up with a reliable breaking ball, scrapping a knuckle-curve and a conventional curve in favor of a low-80s slider with modest break. While he can light up a radar gun, he probably won't be more than a middle reliever unless he can harness his pitches.",0
"PERSON began his pro career a bit slowly, not making his debut until the spring after he was drafted and making it to full-season ball for just eight starts. In his second season, though, he pitched at three levels, finishing in Double-A at age 20. Year three saw him stay all season in Double-A and take some lumps, though his stuff was still very good.It starts with a plus fastball that can touch the upper 90s. His curve is almost as good as the fastball, a big breaking ball he throws in the low 80s. PERSON's changeup is still behind the other two pitches, but while it isn't effective as consistently, there are glimpses of it being an effective offspeed pitch with cutting action. PERSON's biggest issues in 2014 were with his command, as the ORGANIZATION Gamer saw his walk rate jump more than two walks per nine innings from the previous season. He still missed plenty of bats, but he was more a thrower than a pitcher for much of the season.PERSON's stuff is still as electric as just about any pitching prospect in baseball. He pitched all of the 2015 season at age 22, with plenty of time to develop a better feel for pitching and become the frontline starter the ORGANIZATION envisioned when they drafted him.",1
"The first of two ORGANIZATION' first-round picks in 2015, PERSON has been pushed fairly aggressively, along with fellow first-rounder PERSON. A teenager in Double-A in 2017, the left-hander finished fifth in the league in strikeouts and eighth in ERA.The 6-foot-1 southpaw thrives with a three-pitch mix that starts with outstanding fastball command. He throws his heater in the 88-93 mph range, but it plays up because of its movement and because of PERSON's ability to move it in and out with ease. That can occasionally get him into trouble, as he falls in love with his fastball command and pitches off of his fastball too much. His changeup, once his third offering, is now a plus pitch and PERSON would often fall into a fastball-changeup pattern. That's something that isn't necessary, given he still possesses a plus curve. While his walk rate jumped in 2017, he still is very much a strike-thrower.As long as PERSON continues to mix his pitches well, he has the makings of a solid big league starter. Perhaps he has the ceiling of a No. 3 type starter, but he's pretty close to being ready to reaching it at age 20.",1
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 28, 2017 - PERSON, Fla.Favorite MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON right-handed pitcher PERSON has made 11 All-Tournament Teams since 2014, is labeled as a top 100 prospect and has been included on two Showcase Top Prospect Lists. PERSON participated in the 2015 ORGANIZATION and the 2016 ORGANIZATION, and earned a 2015 ORGANIZATION and was honored with a slot on the 2016 ORGANIZATION Team.The right-handed pitcher has good size and arm strength with a feel for his secondary pitches. His fastball hovers around 90-92 mph and his curveball sits at 76-77.",0
"Though he served as a swingman on a loaded 2016 Florida pitching staff that ultimately may include as many as five first-round picks, scouts still projected Dunning as a slam-dunk starter in pro ball. The FACILITY considered him with the 26th overall pick before taking PERSON, then acquired him six months later from the ORGANIZATION (who signed him for $2 million at ORGANIZATION. 29) as part of the ORGANIZATION trade. The younger brother of ex-big leaguer PERSON, he posted a 2.94 ERA with a 168/38 K/BB ratio at two Class A stops in his first full pro season.Dunning's fastball works as a plus pitch, more for its heavy sink than its velocity, which is fine sitting in the low 90s and peaking at 96. He recorded a 1.7 groundout/flyout ratio in his first two years in the Minors, though his home run rate spiked to 1.1 per nine innings in high Class A after he surrendered just one homer in his first 61 2/3 pro innings. His fastball also plays up because of his ability to command it to both sides of the plate.Dunning's slider with depth and his changeup both have the potential to become at least solid secondary offerings, though they need more consistency. He has an athletic delivery and repeats it fairly well, allowing him to pound the strike zone. The most polished of GPE's top pitching prospects, he was rushing toward the big leagues until he was shut down in late June with a moderate elbow sprain.",0
"The PERSON' capacity to sign PERSON, a 30th-round pick, for $850,000 in 2013 was largely due to the club's failure to sign first-rounder PERSON. The hulking first baseman subsequently emerged as one of the organization's better pure hitters, delivering a career-high 23 home runs and finishing second and third in the LOCATION in on-base percentage (.387) and slugging (.530), respectively in 2016. Though he was unable to build on that success in his first Triple-A campaign, PERSON also spent the entire season as a 22-year-old at the ORGANIZATION' highest level. A physically strong left-handed hitter, PERSON possesses the requisite bat speed to turn on premium velocity as well as the barrel control to drive the ball out of the park the other way. He became trapped between the two approaches often in 2017, and the result was less impactful contact as well a drop-off in his power, as PERSON's six home runs marked his lowest output at any full-season level. Said approach continued to net him a healthy number of walks, though, and PERSON's manageable strikeout rate suggests he'll resume hitting for both average and power. He'll need to show more utility against same-sided pitching (.148/.235/.213 in '17) to be a regular.Though a fringy defender at first base, PERSON has worked hard to upgrade his defense to where it should at least be serviceable. Meanwhile, PERSON officials rave about PERSON's work ethic and makeup, citing his determination to improve his body and defense as examples. The first-base-only profile is a notoriously difficult one to achieve, but PERSON has the hitting ability and power to make it happen.",1
" Keep an eye on PERSON. The infielder has progressed in all areas of his game and has emerged as one of the top prospects from GPE since ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION in GPE last November. Listed as a shortstop, PERSON has also shown the ability to play third base and shined at the position at ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION in January.PERSON could end up at one of the corner spots in the infield or make the shift to the outfield because of his size (6-foot-3, 210 pounds) and strong arm. But he might be athletic enough to stay at shortstop.Scouts like his big body and his raw power. PERSON also has the ability to hit for power to all fields and has a knack for putting the barrel of his bat on the ball. He is sometimes fooled by offspeed pitches and could use more game experience.",0
"The GPE righty has a background playing hockey and has the frame and demeanor to be a defenseman in the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION challenged the polished sinker/slider standout with a 2017 assignment to Double-A at age 19 and he excelled, while also developing a changeup that was above average to plus to match his high spin rate two-plane breaking ball. PERSON likely gets an ORGANIZATION look in 2018 at age 20 and while the upside isn't frontline since he sits 90-94 mph, you could argue everything he does is above average to plus.",1
" When the ORGANIZATION signed PERSON out of GPE in the fall of 2011, they saw a tall and projectable right-hander they hoped would evolve into big league starting material. It appeared like he was just starting to put it together when he was one of three pitching prospects sent to GPE as part of the huge PERSON trade. The 6-foot-4 20-year-old has natural size and arm strength working in his favor. With a loose arm, he can run his fastball up to 94-95 mph. He throws it with a ton of sink, already showing a propensity for groundball outs. He complements his fastball with a slider that shows glimpses of being a quality breaking ball and also has a feel for a changeup. In small increments, PERSON has shown an ability to make adjustments, and he's become a little more efficient, in terms of finding the strike zone. PERSON back at the start of the 2015 season in extended spring training, PERSON impressed the ORGANIZATION enough to earn a move to full-season Lansing in early May,",1
"Replacing 2016 Pirates first-rounder PERSON's bat in its lineup was a formidable chore for PERSON, but it also needed to find someone to succeed him as closer. After recording a 9.19 ERA as a scatter-armed freshman a year ago, PERSON has proven adept at finishing games for the ORGANIZATION as a Draft-eligible sophomore. His stuff hasn't changed that much but his mechanics and mindset have improved significantly. PERSON operates with two pitches that produce a lot of swings and misses as well as weak contact. His fastball usually runs from 91-95 mph and touches 97 with hard, late sink. His slider arrives in the low 80s and tops out at 86, qualifying as a plus offering at its sharpest.Though his quality athleticism theoretically should translate into good control, PERSON still can be erratic when it comes to throwing strikes. His arm works well but his power stands out more than his feel for pitching. If he can do a better job of locating his pitches, he could profile as a seventh-inning reliever in the big leagues.",0
"Most pitchers tuck their gloves in by their ribs when they disconnect and begin to clear their front sides; PERSON's glove extends way out away from his body, the start of one of baseball's funkiest deliveries. Repertoire depth, plus fastball and breaking ball spin, and efficient strike-throwing all mix with the mechanical deception to enable PERSON's success despite a lack of velocity. He's long been projected as a reliever but continues to start in the minors, and he's had some dominant outings in addition to the low walk rates, and his spin rate has ticked up pretty significantly each of the last two seasons, which is rare. He may end up in a multi-inning role of some kind, as his strange mechanics would certainly give hitters a weird look one time through the lineup. 
PERSON was struck in the head by a comeback in mid-April. He walked off the field under his own power but it's unclear what his timetable for return is at list publication.",1
"PERSON entered his senior year of high school as a talented two-sport project with a, having size and arm speed, but inconsistent command, offspeed stuff, and somewhat strange east/west elements to his delivery. His superior athleticism shone through in the spring, along with improved direction to the plate, and the ORGANIZATION popped him ninth overall in 2016 with an eye toward PERSON becoming a frontline starter. 
Early in pro ball, PERSON had some real trouble with strike-throwing, then slowly settled in. He has two easy plus pitches in his fastball and curveball, but his changeup is almost always below average, and his command comes and goes. His fastball plays up due to his excellent extension, but he gets so much extension that he overstrides and it reduces the amount of feel he has, both in his changeup and command. If PERSON can dial down the aggression in his delivery a bit, the starter traits should come to the forefront and give the ORGANIZATION a No. 2 or 3 starter.",0
"We don't typically project such a strong post-draft uptick in velocity for a college starter, but PERSON was worked so hard during his junior year at PERSON that we believe the velo he showed last year was beneath what we'll see with a more regimented workload as a pro. He was sitting 92-96 as a rising sophomore on Cape Cod, but often sat 90-94, and sometimes 88-91, throughout his starts the following spring. While we anticipate a rebound -- and PERSON has been 94-97 in bullpens and simulated environments this spring -- college starters often experience a slight downturn in velo because they're being asked to go every fifth day for five months instead of once a week for three and a half. While there's a wide array of potential outcomes for PERSON's fastball, his command, breaking ball quality, prototypical frame, and mechanical consistency have been stable. He at least profiles as a quick-moving backend starter, but could be a mid-rotation arm if the velo comes back, and he's a good bet to be on our mid-year top 100 update.",0
"PERSON PERSON spent parts of six seasons pitching out of the ORGANIZATION' bullpen. His nephew, PERSON, was on the brink of being able to do even more than that with PERSON when a 50-game suspension for performance-enhancers at the start of the 2014 season put a cloud over his future. PERSON did bounce back from that to make it back up to the big leagues in late May.PERSON has all the weapons to start, beginning with a fastball that can touch 95-96 mph. He throws a hard cutter-like slider that is an out pitch at times, and his changeup shows flashes of being above average as well. PERSON struggles with the consistency of his secondary stuff, but he has the ceiling of having three above-average Major League offerings if it can all come together. Staying healthy -- PERSON has missed considerable time in each of the past two seasons -- would help him get the mound development time he needs.Â Now past his suspension, if PERSON can stay healthy, he might be able to continue as a starter. If not, he could follow his uncle's path to the bullpen.",0
"It took a while for PERSON, the ORGANIZATION' top pick in the 2012 Draft, to show what he could do, as injuries interrupted both his summer debut and his first full season of pro ball. Healthy in 2014, the younger brother of ORGANIZATION prospect PERSON played across two levels of A ball before finishing the year in Double-A. He was very productive in his first full season at that level in 2015.PERSON has a solid approach at the plate with good knowledge of the strike zone. He's added some strength since he signed and while he's never going to be a big power guy, he has shown some extra-base pop. That might be enough bat considering how effective a shortstop PERSON is. While not a burner, he has enough range, excellent instincts, good hands and a strong arm, giving him enough to stay at the position long-term. The ORGANIZATION are pleased with how PERSON has developed and think he has the potential to be a No. 2 hitter and everyday shortstop.",1
"The final pick (1,216th overall) in the 2013 Draft, PERSON made one start in three college seasons at GSP. That was more a testament to the ORGANIZATION' incredible depth -- their 2016 staff featured as many as five first-rounders and eight pitchers who could be big league starters -- and the ORGANIZATION planned on moving him to the rotation after selecting him in the third round that June. He made a smooth transition to starting in 2017, when he came to the ORGANIZATION as part of a July trade for PERSON has three solid pitches that can be plus offerings at their best. His 91-94 mph fastball tops out at 96 and generates a lot of groundouts because of its sink and the angle he creates with his 6-foot-4 frame. He has tremendous feel for his slider, a mid-80s weapon with late break that he also can morph into an upper-80s cutter. PERSON's changeup can be just as effective as his fastball and slider because it sinks and fades and he sells it well with his arm speed. He commands all three offerings and also has a curveball he can mix in to give hitters a different look. He has the look of a durable No. 3 starter and emerged as PERSON's best pitching prospect in less than a year after joining the organization.",0
"PERSON had four position players selected in the top three rounds a year ago, and could have as many as five drafted in 2017 if superstar PERSON gets taken as a first baseman. The most productive hitter in the ORGANIZATION lineup, PERSON redshirted in his first year in college and played part-time in 2016. He broke out with 11 homers in the ORGANIZATION last summer and has shown power along with improved polish at the plate this spring.PERSON' best attribute is his right-handed power. He has a quick, compact swing and strength and leverage in his 6-foot-3 frame. He has walked almost as much as he has struck out in his two college seasons. He doesn't sell out for home runs and has a chance to hit for both power and average.He has played mostly third base this spring, shifting to first base when ORGANIZATION pitches so PERSON can get prized freshman PERSON into the lineup. PERSON is a decent defender at the hot corner, possessing an average arm but somewhat limited range because he lacks quickness. He's similar to his predecessor at third on the ORGANIZATION, 2016 ORGANIZATION third-rounder PERSON, who had a bit more athleticism but a little less pop.",0
"In the 2012 Draft, PERSON in GPE had two top-level Draft prospects, both of whom went in the supplemental first round. One, right-hander PERSON, went to the ORGANIZATION. The other, GPE, went to the ORGANIZATION six picks earlier and has been hitting his way up the organization's ladder since, reaching Double-A before his 21st birthday.GPE is one of the best pure hitters in the Minors, with as advanced an approach at the plate as many veterans. He works counts and draws a lot of walks, with an on-base percentage over .400 as he headed into the 2015 season. He's a line-drive machine capable of hitting doubles in bunches. There's power there, too, and while he won't sacrifice his approach for the long ball, he should start sending more balls over the fence as he matures. He may never be a ORGANIZATION winner, but he's developed into a dependable left fielder.As the best hitter, especially left-handed, the ORGANIZATION have developed since PERSON, GPE is often compared to the ORGANIZATION' right fielder. He could be playing in the same outfield as him in the not too distant future.",1
"The Indians parted with two former first-rounders, PERSON (ORGANIZATION. 5 overall in 2013) and ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION. 31 in 2014), as part of a four-prospect package to get PERSON from the ORGANIZATION in July 2016. While the former would make his GPE debut the next year, ORGANIZATION didn't get his crack at the Majors until late 2018, when he made three appearances out of the ORGANIZATION' bullpen as a September callup. Following the season, the ORGANIZATION acquired ORGANIZATION, right-hander PERSON and outfielder PERSON Thompson-Williams in the PERSON deal. ORGANIZATION could have three plus pitches when all is said and done. His 92-97 mph fastball features some run and sink and is his most consistent offering, though his mid-80s slider may have more upside. His changeup isn't as reliable as his first two options, yet he still shows the ability to miss bats with it. Throwing strikes consistently remains a challenge for ORGANIZATION, as he regressed with his control in 2018 after making strides the previous year.Though ORGANIZATION is a little shorter than desired for a starter, he still creates downhill plane with his delivery and doesn't throw with excessive effort. His athleticism and durability aid his chances of becoming a ORGANIZATION. 3 starter, though he'll need to make further gains with his control and refine his changeup to reach that potential.",1
"GPE to former GPE ace PERSON, PERSON pitches above his stuff and has advanced feel for his craft. He cracked the ORGANIZATION' rotation as a freshman and starred at the ORGANIZATION World Series, and he has succeeded PERSON as the team's top starter the past two seasons. PERSON throws harder than PERSON, but he doesn't light up any radar guns at 87-91 mph. His fastball is effective nonetheless because it has run and sink and he's able to spot it where he wants. It sets up his best pitch, his changeup, and he also mixes in cutters and curveballs.PERSON is a quality athlete for his size and has a fluid delivery, which allows him to fill the strike zone with ease. His ceiling is limited to a No. 4 or 5 starter, but he's a good bet to reach it.",0
"After pitching sparingly in three college seasons at LOCATION, PERSON signed as a seventh-round pick in 2016 and quickly established himself as the best left-handed pitching prospect in the FACILITY system. Then his stuff regressed in his first full pro season, which ended three weeks early after he strained an oblique. Working with diminished velocity helped him become a better pitcher, however, and he has consistently registered quality starts throughout '18.PERSON' fastball velocity fluctuated from 88-97 mph with the Trojans, parked at 92-97 during his pro debut, but sat around 90 mph in 2017. He's working at 90-94 mph this year, giving him more separation from a quality changeup that can be a well above-average pitch at its best. He has tightened his curveball in '18 and also will mix in a slider/cutter.PERSON' control was as inconsistent as his fastball in college, but he has pounded the strike zone throughout his pro career. Though he doesn't have a plus pitch and doesn't miss a lot of bats -- both of which limit his ceiling -- he has a reasonably high floor as a back-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"GPE is an above-average runner, defender and thrower, but scouts aren't completely sold on him offensively, projecting him as a gap-to-gap hitter with modest power. PERSON had the trump card to sign him earlier this year and wouldn't top the rumored $2 million price he was offered to wait for July 2nd, 2019.",0
"In the final Draft before bonus pools came into play, PERSON turned pro for $675,000 as a 29th-round pick in 2011 out of an Illinois high school. He signed late that summer and spent two years in different Rookie leagues, so he didn't reach full-season ball until 2014. He has improved consistently in the last three seasons and has one of the best combinations of stuff and strike-throwing ability among GPE mound prospects. As he has gotten stronger during the last couple of years, PERSON has added velocity and now works at 92-94 mph and tops out at 96 with his sinking fastball. He has gotten more consistent with his hard curveball and demonstrates good feel for his changeup, which features some fade and sink.PERSON averaged 19 points per game in basketball as a prep senior and had intriguing power potential as a third baseman that could have made him a two-way player had PERSON not signed him away from a GPE PERSON commitment. That athleticism and his sound delivery have allowed him to fill the strike zone since he turned pro. He's generating better plane on his pitches this year, and he has the durability and makeup to perhaps become a No. 3 or 4 starter.",0
" The ORGANIZATION have had some success in developing young pitchers taken out of high school â see GPE, PERSON and PERSON, PERSON â and PERSON might be the next in line. He's big, strong and athletic, albeit raw. His fastball is easily plus, though he's still learning to command it. While he throws two breaking balls, and both can be effective at times, his slider is the better offering, one that eventually could become a plus pitch. His changeup has improved, though it's behind his other offerings. All the pieces are there for him to be a frontline starter. All he needs is time and experience to tighten his command and improve his offspeed stuff and he'll be ready.",0
"A candidate for the first pick in the 2015 Draft, PERSON saw that dream end when he had PERSON surgery that April. Though he dropped to the third round, the ORGANIZATION paid him $2 million, the equivalent of first-round money. They hoped to have him work 100 innings in his first pro season, but his elbow began bothering him after his initial three-inning outing and they shut him down again.When he was healthy at ORGANIZATION, PERSON looked like a No. 1 starter. He sat at 93-97 mph with running life on his fastball and had a pair of swing-and-miss breaking balls in his curveball and slider. He also showed feel for a changeup and found the strike zone with ease.PERSON's 6-foot-6 frame creates angle and plane on his pitches that makes them more difficult to hit. He has No. 1 starter upside but has a long way to go to prove he can hold up physically after working just 145 2/3 innings (including summer ball) in three years of college. In addition to his elbow reconstruction, he also has spondylolysis, a manageable defect of the vertebrae in the lower back.",0
"The ace of a 2013 PERSON pitching staff that included PERSON second-round choice PERSON, PERSON finished among the ORGANIZATION Division I leaders in wins (12), ORGANIZATION (1.57), strikeouts (122), K-BB ratio (6.8) and ORGANIZATION (0.80). He helped the ORGANIZATION end a three-year absence from the ORGANIZATION World Series and finished his sophomore season without allowing an earned run in his final 26 2/3 innings. He extended that streak to 54 innings this spring, when he has been better than ever.PERSON isn't physical or overpowering, but he has exquisite command of his three-pitch arsenal. He effortlessly works at 91-93 mph with his fastball, which plays up because his low three-quarters arm slot produces sink and he can locate the pitch wherever he wants. His changeup is his best secondary pitch, grading as plus at times, and he can throw his three-quarters breaking ball for strikes. Among the 2014 pitching crop, PERSON is the best bet to reach his ceiling and likely will be the first starter to appear in the big leagues. His older brother PERSON, who teamed with PERSON at ORGANIZATION in 2012, is a slick-fielding shortstop in the ORGANIZATION system.",1
"PERSON was a famous name in this class as a sophomore in high school when his loose, quick arm was running his fastball into the mid-90's. Since then, PERSON has filled out considerably at roughly 6'5/250, taking after his father PERSON, a former ORGANIZATION defensive tackle who is the defensive line coach for GPE. PERSON topped out at 99 mph over the summer and has been considered a first round pick for years, but had his worst outing of the spring in his last outing, losing a playoff matchip to PERSON. At his best this spring, PERSON would sit 93-96, hitting 98 mph with a hellacious two-plane slider that was a 65 or 70 pitch for most scouts. His changeup wasn't needed much but flashed average at times and his command was average with control a hair better than that, though some scouts don't love his mechanics.

The questions on PERSON were 1) maintaining his current physique 2) maintaining his athleticism to repeat his delivery and stay a starter and 3) having enough feel to pitch and deception to flourish when he doesn't have his premium stuff. PERSON was often pitching on a week or more of rest this spring, so scouts didn't see diminished stuff until the ORGANIZATION outing, when PERSON was sitting mostly 90-93 mph, dipping into the high 80's in the 4th inning with a breaking ball that was a 50 or 55. His command wasn't as good that day and PERSON was hit around some, visibly frustrated. Granted that was one outing, but it could be considered a concern about a prep pitcher with no physical projection that will likely lose a tick or two of velocity as he matures.",0
"Sits 92-94, will touch 97, has a an explosive but violent arm action, plus slider and started missing some bats with his changeup this year. But PERSON has had fluctuations in weight (he was in good shape this season, but not last) and served multiple team-imposed suspensions, finally culminating in his dismissal from the club a month before the draft.",0
"Extremely projectable and athletic, PERSON could prove to be a steal as a ninth-rounder from the 2012 Draft. The ORGANIZATION thought enough of him to send him to low Class A as an 18-year-old to open '13, and while he struggled at first, he fared better once he returned there in mid-August after a demotion.PERSON generates easy velocity on his fastball, working from 90 to 95 mph and showing the ability to cut and sink the pitch. All three of his secondary pitches have the potential to become average or better down the road, with his curveball currently rating ahead of his slider and changeup.PERSON will need to do a better job of trusting his stuff as he advances. He's also working on smoothing out his delivery so he can throw more strikes. PERSON is still just 19, so he has plenty of time.",0
"It's easy to see why some consider PERSON the top ORGANIZATION prospect in an impressive class of players from the country this year. The 6-foot-2, 175-pound PERSON does everything well and has the potential to be a five-tool player. Scouts have been impressed with the teenager's overall strength and his athletic build. They also like that PERSON can cover ground in the outfield and make all of the plays. Projected as a right fielder, he has been compared to a young PERSON because of his arm and raw power. Other scouts view PERSON as a better fit in left field. Evaluators talk about PERSON's presence on the field. He's a competitor and he is confident. PERSON also shown good work habits and leadership qualities.PERSON is based in GPE la Cruz, GPE, and is trained by PERSON. The ORGANIZATION are considered the favorite to ink the outfielder to a deal.",0
"A college shortstop and closer, PERSON was viewed by the amateur arm of the scouting body as a third base prospect with big power. He was GPE's 2016 second rounder, then was traded the following summer as part of the Luzardo/Doolittle/Madson deal. He wrapped his 2017 season with short, statistically insignificant stints in Hi-A, Double-A, and the ORGANIZATION, but he performed at each stop, so combined there was confidence that PERSON's early-season showing was for real despite his relatively advanced age. 
He was sent right to Triple-A to start 2018 and flopped, hitting just .263/.304/.357 and striking out a concerning 32% of the time. PERSON has also thickened a bit, so while he's still an arm-reliant fit at third, he's trending more toward 3B/1B, and maybe right, than the SS/3B looks GPE gave him early in his career. The combination of the 2018 struggles and somewhat shaky standing on the defensive spectrum makes it imperative that PERSON have a bounce back 2019 performance. He's a baseball rat and younger than similarly-skilled players we've written up so far (like ORGANIZATION third baseman J.D. PERSON), so we're a little more bullish on a rebound here than we are elsewhere. If he struggles again it's perhaps worth considering two-way duty. PERSON was up to 96 in our looks at him in college.",0
" The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their first-round pick (ORGANIZATION. 14 overall) in 2010, and he was set to sign until a post-Draft physical revealed that he had diabetes. He ultimately decided to stay close to home and attend the ORGANIZATION of GPE, where he produced mixed results before going to the A's in the fourth round of the 2013 Draft. After missing much of 2016 with injuries, most notably a strained oblique, he performed well in the ORGANIZATION and got picked by the FACILITY in the ORGANIZATION phase of the Rule 5 Draft.PERSON can run his fastball up to 95 mph but typically sits between 89-93 mph with heavy sink. His best pitch often is his changeup, which features splitter action. He also throws a curveball and slider, both of which have their moments but usually grade as average offerings.Because PERSON lacks a plus pitch, he must keep the ball down in the strike zone to succeed. He doesn't have huge upside as a starter, but he could be an innings eater toward the back of a rotation. Rule 5 mandates that GPE keep him on its active big league roster throughout the 2017 season, or else put him on waivers and offer him back to GPE for half of his $100,000 Draft price.",0
"PERSON stood out for PERSON with a plus heater, above average breaker and solid command, though likely only in relief.",0
" The ORGANIZATION have acquired PERSON twice, first when they drafted him in 2010 and then again in March 2013 in the ORGANIZATION deal. In between, PERSON was part of the package they sent to the A's for PERSON. After a disappointing year with the A's, PERSON broke out in his return to the ORGANIZATION, reaching Double-A Harrisburg and pitching in the 2013 ORGANIZATION.  PERSON relies on his fastball, which sits in the mid-90s and reaches 98 mph. He commands the pitch well and isn't afraid to come after hitters with it. Though both his changeup and curveball aren't as advanced as his fastball, both have the potential to be Major League-average offerings.  If PERSON can hone his offspeed pitches, he has the potential to be the latest homegrown member of the ORGANIZATION rotation.",1
"Jenkins is a quick-twich athlete that made strides last summer turning his tools into skills and continued that this spring. He's a plus plus runner with some bat speed and bat control, but needs to work on consistency.",0
" An outstanding athlete who played football in high school, ORGANIZATION gave up the gridiron to focus on the diamond and take a baseball scholarship to GPE. The Indians were able to sign him away from honoring that commitment. ORGANIZATION has some tools, particularly with a bat in his hands. He has excellent bat speed and should grow into plenty of power as he matures. He has above-average speed, but whether he stays in center field remains to be seen â he saw some time in left field as well during his pro debut --  but he could have enough bat to profile just fine at an outfield corner spot.",0
"PERSON was the ace starter for one of the most prospect-laden prep teams in the country in 2015, PERSON, which was led by 11th overall pick catcher PERSON (Reds) and center fielder PERSON (ORGANIZATION), who got a $500,000 bonus in the 24th round. PERSON could've received a low-to-mid six figure bonus out of high school, but instead went to PERSON, where he mostly relieved, a role that agrees with his aggressive approach and standout fastball/curveball combination. PERSON's command backed up a bit in 2018, which is why he lasted until the fifth round despite being the sort of up-in-the-zone four-seam fastball and power curveball reliever that clubs now favor due to ORGANIZATION data. If he can dial in his delivery and command, there's quick-moving setup man potential for the 22-year-old.",0
"So conservative was PERSON' swing when he first arrived in the states that ORGANIZATION coaches were trying to make adjustments to his lower-half use in the middle of games in the hopes that it would unlock power that was clearly dormant in his hands. He has good control of the strike zone and feel to hit for a teenager but despite playing some second and third, he may ultimately wind up at first base. If that's the case, a change that enables the power is necessary.",0
"It's a good year for hard-throwing pitchers in the GPE junior college ranks, with a few who have the chance to go in the top three rounds. PERSON put up video-game type numbers at ORGANIZATION this spring, raising his Draft profile in the process, then created a huge amount of buzz by hitting triple digits consistently in a bullpen session in late May. There is no question about the quality of PERSON's fastball coming from his 6-foot-6 frame. He was consistently up to 97 mph all spring and has shown an ability to throw strikes with it as well. His secondary stuff, however, has been inconsistent. He throws both a slider and a curve, though the latter is his fourth pitch, and on some days he has two distinct, effective breaking balls. At other times, they run together, and it might serve him well to focus on just one at the next level. His changeup has improved, but it also comes and goes. There is an injury history with PERSON -- he had a screw put in his right elbow in high school -- but he's been nothing but healthy and durable in junior college. There's some debate over whether his future lies in the rotation or out of the bullpen, where his stuff would play up, but there's bound to be a team that believes he can start that will take him in the early rounds.",0
"PERSON didn't sign as a 2nd rounder last year for unclear reasons and has had an up-and-down senior year, but his stuff was a little better down the stretch, likely allowing PERSON to go in the 2nd round again but now with less leverage and at nearly 23 years old.",0
"Slowly and steadly, PERSON is turning himself into a very intriguing second base prospect. A shortstop in high school, he's worked diligently to become a better defender and while some thought a move to the outfield would be in his future, few doubt his ability to stay on the right side of the infield. PERSON has excellent speed and is a top-notch baserunner who should continue to steal bases as he moves up the ladder. He definitely has some ability with the bat and if he can tone down his approach a bit he has the chance to hit for a high average and tap into his average power. He played in just 67 games during his full-season debut in 2012, with an elbow injury ending his year in June. A healthy season in 2013 could help him take off.",0
"GPE of a stellar GPE collegiate national team outfield with PERSON's PERSON and GPE's PERSON last summer, PERSON can't quite match their tools, but he did establish himself as the best pure hitter on the squad. He led PERSON in hitting (.386) and on-base percentage (.491) and projected as a mid-first-round pick. He hasn't been the same since having a cyst removed from his lower back last fall, however, with multiple scouts noting that he has looked stiff and his tools have regressed this spring. At his best, PERSON employs a sleek left-handed swing and delivers line drives from gap to gap. He has above-average raw pop and started to become more aggressive and drive the ball more often in 2015. He hasn't looked as fluid or powerful during a disappointing regular season this year but did help his cause by winning the LOCATION tournament ORGANIZATION award in late May in front of a bevy of scouts.While PERSON showed solid speed and arm strength with PERSON, both tools have elicited fringe-average grades in 2016. He profiled well as a right fielder in the past, but now scouts don't know what to make of him. A club that gives him the benefit of the doubt for past performance could take him in the first three rounds.",0
"The pitches PERSON threw on the final day of GPE's 2018 fall instructional league were his first in more than two years due to an unfortunately-timed PERSON and subsequent rehabilitation. He topped out at 92. In high school, PERSON had No. 4 starter stuff. At his best, he'd sit 90-94 with pinpoint glove-side command of an above-average slider. He was in the 2016 draft's crowded late-first and early-second round prep pitching picture, a group that hasn't yet seen anyone emerge as several have required ORGANIZATION reconstruction. PERSON probably moves into the 40+ FV tier if his velocity and breaking ball are back in the spring, but he's clearly behind the developmental curve for a 21-year-old.",0
"A basketball standout who averaged 19.6 points and 7.8 rebounds per game as a junior, PERSON tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in the second game of his senior season in December. He returned to the mound this April, sooner than expected, and showed enough to merit an early-round selection in the GPE. But he was going to be a tough sign because of his strong commitment to GPE, and then word came out that he needed PERSON surgery in late May.Like his cousin, PERSON, PERSON is a tall right-hander who could blossom into a first-round pick after three years of college. He's very athletic, has a loose arm and has plenty of room to add strength and velocity in the future. PERSON's fastball presently is more notable for its heavy sink and downhill plane than its power. He usually operates at 86-90 mph and top outs at 92. He commands his fastball and mid-70s curveball well, though he'll have to develop his changeup and use it more often at the next level.",0
"A multisport star in high school, PERSON's success on the gridiron at FACILITY (GPE) High led to a scholarship offer to play quarterback at ORGANIZATION. He also excelled on the track, where he won a gold medal in long jump and two relays in his school's division at the 2014 GPE state championships. But PERSON ultimately chose to pursue a career in baseball, signing with the ORGANIZATION for $1,316,000 in 2014 as a second-round pick.PERSON is an exceptional athlete with promising tools, but he's struggled to translate that into production to begin his career. There's a fair amount of swing-and-miss in his game now, and with just 12 walks through 161 pro games across his first two pro seasons, he'll need to tighten his approach considerably in the coming years. PERSON is physically strong and generates good bat speed, and scouts believe he'll eventually tap into his above-average raw power.PERSON's double-plus speed is his greatest asset on the dirt, though he's very much a work in progress defensively. The ORGANIZATION were pleased with his growth at the position in 2015, and particularly with the improved consistency of his throwing. But after receiving considerable work at second base during instructional league in the fall, PERSON has manned the keystone exclusively in 2016.",0
"PERSON was sandwiched between PERSON and PERSON in the 2010 Draft. PERSON and GPE are both already All-Stars. PERSON was on the verge of joining them in the ORGANIZATION before it was discovered that he needed PERSON surgery in April 2014.PERSON is a classic power right-hander, mixing good size with a mid-90s fastball and a hard curveball. His changeup has also made strides, giving him a chance for three above-average pitches. PERSON's fastball has good sinking action, but it tends to flatten out and become easier to hit if he leaves it up in the zone.PERSON commands his pitches well and earns praise for his poise and confidence on the mound. The ORGANIZATION hope he will be able to join PERSON at the front of their big league rotation once he recovers from surgery.",0
"GPE beast from cold weather locale. Has feel for spin and changeup, velo was trending up in the fall, coming out 90-94 in a highly-scouted appearance.",1
"PERSON was worked hard at ORGANIZATION, sometimes throwing about 120 pitches several starts in a row, and his velocity was down after last year's draft. He's a big-framed guy with average stuff that plays up due to extension and his fastball has life that competes in the strike zone. Realistically he's a fifth or sixth starter but let's see how the fastball plays and what happens to the velocity when PERSON is handled in a way that prioritizes development rather than winning Big 12 games.",0
"ORGANIZATION GPE has had one first-round pick in its history: PERSON, back in 2009. While PERSON won't beat PERSON's record of being taken No. 32 overall, the first baseman put together a strong junior season that helped his ORGANIZATION stock considerably.PERSON' calling card is his power. Big and strong, he's shown the ability to hit the ball out, finishing among the ORGANIZATION leaders in home runs last summer. There can be a little length to his swing, and he tends to be a pull hitter, sometimes to a fault. PERSON isn't a runner and has played first base at ORGANIZATION GPE the past two years, though he played an outfield corner as a freshman and on the Cape.Regardless of where he plays defensively, the team that takes him in the first five rounds will be buying his bat and the power potential it brings with it.",1
"After swinging a relatively inconsistent bat for much of his career at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, PERSON got hot late, lifting himself to the second round of the 2016 Draft. The adjustments he had made to show that improvement continued into the ORGANIZATION World Series and his pro debut, where he hit for average and power in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League. A broken hand forced him out for six weeks of his full-season debut, but he was swinging the bat well again early in the second half of 2017.PERSON had shortened his swing and used the whole field more effectively during his junior season, and he carried that over last summer. There had been questions about his hit tool, but he didn't show that in GPE, striking out well below the leave average rate and making good adjustments. If he can continue sticking to his solid game plan, that will allow him to tap into his tremendous raw power -- some evaluators put a 70 on it -- with more consistency. While he's a well below-average runner, PERSON is a solid defender at first.The industry often doesn't like the right-right first base only profile, and PERSON will have to continue to prove he can hit to move past that stigma. If the start to his career is any indication, he has the chance to do just that and be a run-producing presence in the middle of a big league lineup.",0
" One of the best hitters in the class, PERSON might also be the best infield prospect out of GPE this year. The teen has a projectable body and good control on both sides of the ball that reminds some scouts of PERSON at the same age.PERSON might not be the best runner on the field at any given moment, but he could be the most well-rounded. Scouts like his easy actions on defense and smooth swing at the plate. Evaluators have taken note of his emerging raw power and an arm that is strong enough to move to third base if he has to switch positions. His tools might lack the ""wow factor"" that some of the other top prospects possess, but he is considered one of the most consistent, and therefore, one of the most coveted prospects on the market.PERSON, who starred at ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION in February, is from GPE, GPE, and trains with PERSON. The Indians are considered the favorite to land the teenager.",0
" The projectable right-hander has had trouble turning his raw potential into performance thus far In his brief career. The ORGANIZATION sent PERSON to full-season ball in 2011 and he struggled, walking more batters than he struck out. He cut his walk rate in 2012, but he was down a level in the short-season LOCATION and didn't have much other success. His ceiling, athleticism and arm strength still make him worth watching. He still has the potential to have a plus fastball, though his secondary pitches and, obviously, his command need a lot of work.",0
"All Boyd did during his career at ORGANIZATION State was hit and that's continued as he embarked on his first full season of pro ball, quickly earning a promotion up a level. The right-handed hitting first baseman should hit for plenty of average as he moves up the ladder, but it remains to be seen just how much power there is in his bat. A former third baseman, he plays a very solid defensive first base, though it's his bat that will have to carry him up the organizational ladder. How much power he ends up displaying will help determine if he can be an everyday player at first.",0
"PERSON was the first true shortstop taken in the 2013 Draft, and the fifth high school position player selected. PERSON, taken from the junior college ranks one pick after PERSON, beat him to the big leagues, but PERSON, even despite lackluster numbers, still has every chance to be an elite-level impact talent at the premium position.While reaching the highest level of the Minors at a very young age, PERSON has managed to keep his advanced approach at the plate, continuing to draw a ton of walks and keep his strikeout rate low. While he makes a ton of contact, his power hasn't really shown up yet, though there is still hope he will grow into 10-15 home run performer as he matures. PERSON also continues to display outstanding defensive skills at short. Even though he has just average speed, he has tremendous range, footwork and hands to go along with a plus arm.PERSON's numbers should be digested with the knowledge that he is still just 22 years old, but the lack of production does start to be concerning. There's still plenty of time for him to develop into the All-Star caliber shortstop at the big league level everyone thought he'd be.",1
"He's not especially toolsy or projectable, but PERSON is so polished in all facets (especially his reads in center field) that it was he who the ORGANIZATION called up when early-season injury dominos necessitated that the they push a low-level outfielder to Hi-A. When PERSON was sent back to developmentally appropriate Low-A PERSON, he excelled. Tough to beat with only velocity because of how short his swing is, PERSON hit .322 for PERSON and would have won the ORGANIZATION batting title had he taken enough at-bats to qualify, but his hand was struck by a pitch in early July, ending his season. The general consensus is that PERSON may ultimately have limited value due to a lack of power, and end up either as a fourth outfielder or a regular on par with what PERSON or PERSON have been to this point, and we agree that range of outcomes is most likely. But PERSON entered 2018 with a more open, upright stance that seemed to benefit his timing and enabled him to pull the ball more, so perhaps last year's power output isn't a complete mirage and there are some right-tail paths to everyday production.",0
"PERSON had some late helium ahead of the 2017 Draft after he hit 102 mph during a heavily scouted bullpen session in late May. The ORGANIZATION ended up selecting the ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION product with the second of their two first-round picks the following month, signed him for slightly above slot value at $2,452,900 and then watched him light up radar guns during a dominant pro debut. PERSON's first full season lasted just 1 2/3 innings as he suffered a fractured right forearm after being struck by a line drive in early May, but he returned to the mound and impressed in the ORGANIZATION, finishing with a series of strong outings after a rusty start.PERSON features front-of-the-rotation stuff when he's healthy, including the best fastball and slider in GPE's system. His fastball sits in the upper 90s and routinely touches triple digits, and he showed he could run his heater up to 103-104 during an all-out first inning in the ORGANIZATION. His slider is a similarly powerful offering, thrown in the upper 80s with late, glove-side bite that leads to both whiffs and weak contact, especially against righties. He showed feel for landing a top-to-bottom curveball in the zone during the ORGANIZATION, giving him a solid change-of-pace breaking ball, and his changeup should be at least average once developed.PERSON uses his height to his advantage, creating a downhill angle to the plate so as to pound his fastball and slider down in the zone, and he's athletic enough to believe that both his control and command will improve as he gains experience. Few pitching prospects in the Minors can match PERSON's high ceiling, and he can move closer to reaching it with a healthy campaign in 2019.",0
"Originally a fourth-round Draft pick of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON was sent to GPE for PERSON in December 2011. PERSON had been a reliever in 2010 and 2011 in the Oriolesâ system, and thatâs how he started the 2012 season, his first with the ORGANIZATION. He was dominating the Class A Advanced PERSON, posting a 0.98 ERA, a .208 ORGANIZATION and seven saves out of the bullpen. The ORGANIZATION tried him out in the rotation, and that experiment started out well, until he hit a wall in July and August, finishing with 4.53 ERA and .304 ORGANIZATION in 11 starts. Any team considering him in the Rule 5 will surely be looking at him back in a bullpen role.",0
"There's an epidemic of baseball personnel calling one another 'coach' that is believed to be derived from the lexicon of PERSON' signing area scout. That scout finds players, coach, as PERSON is another in a long line of ORGANIZATION late-round steals at smaller colleges in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON traded him to GPE in the ORGANIZATION Gausman deal last summer, during PERSON' breakout season. Before 2018, PERSON would sit in the mid-90s, reach 97, and mix in a solid average slider, but the off-speed consistency and command weren't strong. Both of those things ticked up in 2018 at Triple-A, but regressed during PERSON' 11.2 inning ORGANIZATION debut. Like PERSON, PERSON will look to put his late summer struggles with the new club behind him and reach his upside as a middle reliever in 2019.",1
"Ever since signing out of GPE in 2014 at age 16 in 2014, PERSON has shown a feel for pitching that belies his age and experience. While that hasn't translated to consistent statistical success as of yet, the organization thought highly enough to send him to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON's playoff run in 2016, giving up two runs in 10 innings over two starts. He made his full-season debut in 2017 at the age of 19.Based on a radar gun, PERSON's fastball is fringy, in the 89-91 mph range, but it plays up because of its life and his ability to command it well. There might be more in the tank velocity-wise as he physically matures and he's already shown a penchant for groundball outs. His best secondary pitch is his changeup, which could be a plus pitch when all is said and done. He throws a big, looping curve ball which will need refinement as he moves up the ladder, but he did start missing more bats in 2016.While PERSON throws a ton of strikes, improvement of his command within the zone will help him continue to miss bats and generate weak contact, as he's been a bit too hittable in the early stages of his career. With time and physical maturity, he could develop into a solid back half of the rotation starter.",1
"The ORGANIZATION went above pick value in the 10th round of the 2013 Draft, giving PERSON $200,000 to sign out of ORGANIZATION in GPE, because they saw a potential up-the-middle player with special defensive skills. Now as he reaches the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION, it seems he's proven them right.PERSON has the fastest hands in the system, the kind of defensive master who is fun to watch take ground balls. PERSON might have smoother actions, but PERSON has more quickness in terms of his hands, feet and release, with an above-average arm to boot. PERSON does have some hitting skills, showing good knowledge of the strike zone and an ability to make consistent contact. He's worked hard to add strength, but with just one home run in close to 1,300 Minor League at-bats, there is no power to speak of.With his defensive ability, few question PERSON will be a big leaguer. If he can square the ball up a bit more consistently and produce more line drives, he has the chance to be a regular at a premium position, one who could compete for ORGANIZATION Gloves one day.",1
"A wispy, tall righty with arguably as much physical projection as any high school righty since PERSON, PERSON will likely add zip to his currently fringey fastball as his body matures. He has some breaking ball feel and could have an above average curve at peak. Like most high schoolers this size, PERSON needs mechanical refinement. But his delivery isn't inherently violent or messy and he should develop starter's control with reps. His ceiling will be dictated by how much velo he can add as he fills out, but he projects as a fourth or fifth starter fairly conservatively, he's just a bit of a project and has some signability concerns.",0
" PERSON was one of the fastest-rising high school arms in the 2012 GPE class, but then missed some time with triceps tendinitis. He came back to throw well, allowing him to enter into many first-round conversations and eventually go early in the sandwich round. He didnât get to throw much during his summer debut, as he came down with mono and got shut down in mid-July until instructs. When healthy, heâs the kind of projectable right-hander who excites scouts. His fastball sits in the low 90s, but he can reach back for more at times. The heater has good life to it, making it an even better pitch, coming from a downill plane. His changeup might be a plus pitch, which is unusual for a high schooler. His breaking ball can be slurvy, but if he can throw it harder, it might develop into a third above-average offering. With good control, a good pitching frame, excellent stuff and outstanding mound presence, thereâs a good reason why he was thought of so highly during the GPE.",1
"PERSON' thick lower half and average arm portend a move to second base, where his footwork and quick actions could make him an above average defender. He has a compact stroke from both sides of the plate and projects as an aboev average hitter. His upside will be dictated by how much game power he can grow into.",0
" Among the more advanced pitching prospects in the ORGANIZATION' system, PERSON might have the best feel for pitching, but this lefty from GPE has a higher ceiling. The lefty topped the system in strikeouts in 2012 (he was third in all of the Minors), while he finished fourth in ORGANIZATION and fifth in batting average against. He did it with three pitches that have the chance to be above-average. He's shown an ability to beat a team in a number of different ways, depending on what's working for him that outing, sometimes pitching off his fastball, sometimes getting hitters with his slider, others with his changeup. He projects to have above-average control of all of them, giving him the chance to be at least a No. 3 starter, if not more, in the big leagues.",0
"GPE has started convincing more people in baseball that he's a capable defensive shortstop, drawing PERSON defensive comparisions because of his size. He's hitting and already performing at Double-A at age 20. He projects as an above-average everyday player right now, but his stock is rising.",1
"ORGANIZATION's Friday night starter in 2014, PERSON's solid pro debut in the ORGANIZATION had the ORGANIZATION excited about seeing what he can do in his first full year of pro ball, and he largely hasn't disappointed.PERSON has the makings of the kind of three-pitch mix that can sit in a big league rotation one day, with both his fastball and curve grading out as at least above-average. He added velocity in 2014 and can touch the mid-90s and the plus sink has already proven to be a groundball-inducing weapon as a pro. He can add and subtract from the breaking ball and he can miss bats with it at times. His changeup is inconsistent, but there is some deception and sink to it and should be a useful third pitch. PERSON has struggled with his command at times, and there is some effort to his delivery, so some believe he's destined for the bullpen. But he's been around the plate as a pro and the ORGANIZATION will let him remain as a starter for the time being.",0
"GPE viewed as a high-risk, high-reward prospect for his massive raw power and penchant for striking out, PERSON began to shed that label in 2017. Thanks to improved eyesight from contact lenses, the 2014 supplemental first-rounder came into his own offensively, showing a more discipline approach while hitting for average and power en route to GPE League All-Star honors and then finishing the season in Double-A. A right-handed hitter with plus bat speed, PERSON knows how to leverage his swing and generate extension through the zone so as to generate booming contact to all fields. He got to his robust raw power more than ever in 2017, setting career highs in home runs (15), doubles (40) and slugging percentage (.441). That power did come with a career-high strikeout total (161), but PERSON's strikeout rate went largely unchanged, and he made huge strides with his approach and plate discipline, finishing the season with far and away the best walk rate (9 percent), average (.264) and on-base percentage (.333) of his career.Drafted as a shortstop, PERSON spent his first two seasons at the position before shifting to third base. He's since moved across the diamond to first base, and club officials are quick to note his rapid improvement there. Though he'll be challenged at high levels, PERSON showed in 2017 that he's plenty capable of making the necessary adjustments.",0
"  PERSON's solid career at ORGANIZATION led the ORGANIZATION to make him the first college catcher selected in the 2013 Draft, but he needed PERSON surgery that October. After missing the first month of the next season as he completed his recovery, he played well after his reinstatement from the disabled list, then followed that up by reaching Double-A in 2015.A switch-hitter, PERSON is capable of rapping line drives and hitting for power from both sides of the plate. He didn't catch a whole lot at ORGANIZATION, and the ORGANIZATION eased him back into the position after his surgery. As a result, his defense lags behind his offense. He has a strong arm and earns praise for his baseball IQ but will have to improve his receiving.PERSON may always be an offensive-minded catcher, but he has the chance to develop into an everyday player behind the plate in the future.",0
"The biggest surprise in the first round of the 2013 PERSON came when the ORGANIZATION took the relatively unheralded PERSON with the 25th choice and signed him for $1,866,500. He won the Rookie-level PERSON MVP award in his pro debut and has silenced his doubters by establishing himself as one of the purest hitters in the ORGANIZATION. He tore up Triple-A for the first three weeks of 2017 to earn his first big league callup in GPE, but he played just eight games after returning to the ORGANIZATION in June because he injured his wrist and then broke his left hand. Following the season, the ORGANIZATION sent PERSON with PERSON and pitching prospects PERSON and PERSON to PERSON for PERSON's tremendous hand-eye coordination allows him to barrel balls with ease from the right side of the plate, producing hard contact to all fields. He puts the bat on the ball almost too easily, because he rarely walks and delivered just 20 homers in his first four years as a pro. If he were to become more selective at the plate and look to drive the ball more often, his biggest proponents believe he could develop at least average power.After spending most of his first three pro seasons at shortstop, PERSON has divided his playing time between short, third and second. He has the hands and arm strength to play shortstop, but he lacks desirable range and quickness and is better suited for the hot corner.",1
"A three-year starter at GPE, PERSON has stood out in the wood bat PERSON, being named an All-Star for two years in a row. Some of that offensive performance carried over to his junior season, where he hit for average and more power than he had previously in his career.A left-handed hitter, PERSON has an advanced approach at the plate with very good plate discipline that allowed him to walk more than he has struck out over the course of his college career. The infielder reached double-digits in home runs as a junior, nearly doubling his total over his first two years combined, though his power at the next level is more likely to be of the extra-base, not over-the-fence, variety. With a below-average arm and fringy speed, PERSON is limited to second base.The PERSON had a middle infielder taken in the fourth round of the 2017 Draft in GPE, now with the ORGANIZATION, though he's a shortstop. PERSON may not go quite as early, but his success on the GPE, as well as his junior year, could get him off the board not long after.",0
"PERSON was a high profile amateur, closing for ORGANIZATION and PERSON before PERSON took him in the third round in 2015. They didn't add him to the 40-man this winter and the ORGANIZATION took him in the Rule 5 as an MLB-ready middle reliever who flashes two plus pitches at times. The bump in the road that led to not adding PERSON to the 40-man roster was a shoulder aneurysm that derailed his 2016 season. He needed a surgery that transplanted a vein from his groin into his shoulder in order to repair it, and the industry worried at the time that the injury threatened his career. His above-to-plus stuff is back and PERSON is at least a big league-ready middle reliever with a chance to be a set-up man. There was some suggestion by scouts that PERSON wasn't the type of pitcher who excels with all of the data and information that PERSON offered; PERSON's approach with him will reflect that.",0
"The ORGANIZATION are no strangers to being aggressive on the international market, particularly when GPE players become available. They jumped at the chance to sign PERSON, who was No. 4 on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list when he got $4.75 million from the ORGANIZATION to sign. After impressing early with his bullpen sessions and showing initial polish similar to fellow PERSON, the right-hander appeared to get away from his strengths during a rocky first pro season in 2017.The 2018 season was a nice step forward for PERSON. He did a good job of finding his delivery, which enabled him to stay on top of the ball better and created a better angle. As a result, he had better action on his pitches and a more consistent break on his curveball, which lost its sharpness when he would get under or on the side of the ball. But he wasn't able to repeat that success in 2019.An improved tempo also increased PERSON's ability to pound the strike zone in 2018, though his walk rate spiked the following season.. With a three-pitch mix that gives him a good chance to start, PERSON's fastball touches as high as 97-98 mph. If he can get back to what led to his success in '18 and continues to refine his pitches, he might not be far from reaching the big leagues.",0
"PERSON has an impeccable track record at the plate. He ranked second in ORGANIZATION Division I with 105 hits while batting .401 as a sophomore in 2013, and he hit .373 in three years at ORGANIZATION before signing for $75,000 as a 14th-rounder in 2014. He won the Class A ORGANIZATION batting title (.321) in his first full year as a pro, ranked second in the Double-A LOCATION (.303) in 2016 and batted .351 in the ORGANIZATION Winter League during the offseason.PERSON makes line-drive contact with ease, thanks to his fabulous hand-eye coordination, simple right-handed swing and quality approach. He uses the entire field and walks nearly as much as he strikes out. He offers little power and won't be a stolen base threat with his average speed, though he is aggressive on the bases.A third baseman in college, PERSON has played all four infield spots and both outfield corners as a pro. His sure hands make him a reliable defender at any spot, though his fringy arm is stretched as a shortstop and third baseman. While he's actually older than GPE's star double-play tandem of PERSON and PERSON, PERSON could help the ORGANIZATION as a sweet-swinging utilityman in the near future.",0
"While PERSON was PERSON's top high school position prospect in 2016, his bat stood out more than his athleticism and he wasn't a highly regarded recruit or GPE target. That profile remains true today but now he's one of the best pure hitters in college baseball and a likely first-round pick. He has been one of the ORGANIZATION's most dangerous bats the last two years and also has starred in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON makes it look easy at the plate. He has a smooth left-handed swing with plenty of bat speed and a patient, balanced approach that allows him to hammer balls to all fields. He should hit for average and power while drawing plenty of walks, and few college players in this GPE have a higher offensive ceiling or floor.PERSON's GPE status is compromised somewhat by uncertainty about his future home. He's small for a first baseman and has below-average to fringy speed and arm strength. He's more athletic than his 6-foot, 207-pound frame might indicate -- he starred in football and hockey as well as baseball in high school -- and possibly could handle second base (where he played on the GPE) or left field (where he has seen action this spring).",0
"GPE GPE (PERSON, Ga.) has produced six big leaguers, including All-Stars Domonic PERSON, PERSON and PERSON. PERSON came to GPE this spring to check out speedy shortstop PERSON and came away more impressed with PERSON, who entered 2018 more noted as a position player. Now his future clearly is on the mound, though the difference between his present and his projection may make him difficult to sign away from GPE Carolina.PERSON pitches at 88-91 mph and reaches 93 with sink on his fastball, and his quick arm and athletic frame promise more velocity to come. He'll show flashes of a quality 12-to-6 curveball at times, though it sometimes loses power and shape. He's working on a changeup and needs to create more velocity separation from his heater.PERSON's athleticism and clean delivery bode well for his future control. His stuff and command currently lack consistency, so he might spend two years in GPE ball if he signs out of GPE. But his upside could make the youngest player on ORGANIZATION's Top 200 (he won't turn 18 until next March) worth the wait.",0
"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 60 | Run: 20 | Arm: 60 | Field: 40 | Overall: 50PERSON is the most intriguing two-way player available in the 2015 Draft. He was known primarily as a pitcher before he began displaying his prodigious power at major summer events, winning the ORGANIZATION at the All-Star Game and another home run competition before the Under PERSON All-America Game at FACILITY. PERSON deployed him mainly as a first baseman while winning a gold medal at the 18-and-under PERSON Championship in GPE in September.For all his power, the consensus is that the ORGANIZATION recruit is more talented on the mound. His size and strength translate into 90-95 mph fastballs on a downhill plane, though his heater can get straight at times. His low-80s slider is a solid second pitch, and he also shows some aptitude for throwing a changeup and filling the strike zone.As a position player, PERSON generates well above-average right-handed power with strength and bat speed. Scouts aren't in love with his swing, however, and his lack of speed limits him to first base.",0
"Rather than sign with the ORGANIZATION as a 48th-rounder out of high school in 2010, PERSON opted to play defensive back for PERSON's football team. He took two years off to complete a Mormon mission and didn't return to baseball until 2013, when he showed enough athleticism and upside for the GPE to sign him for $1 million as a third-round pick. Three years later, PERSON still has impressive tools but remains raw at the plate. He struggles to command the strike zone, so he gets himself out too often, and his strength doesn't translate into power as much as it should. He's also not on base enough to take advantage of his well above-average speed, which allowed him to succeed on 87 percent of his steals attempts in his first three pro seasons.PERSON has made obvious improvements with his defense, strengthening his arm and improving his jumps and routes to become a plus center fielder. He may never live up to the PERSON and PERSON comparisons that he entered pro ball with, and an outfield logjam awaits him in GPE, but PERSON could become a valuable fourth outfielder if he can get his bat going.",0
"ORGANIZATION hasn't produced a high school player drafted in the top five rounds since 1996. En route to pitching parts of seven seasons in the Majors, PERSON went in the second round -- about the same area in which PERSON figures to go in June. PERSON made a name for himself during the summer, earning ORGANIZATION recognition at the ORGANIZATION All-America Classic and batting .435 with a team-high five extra-base hits to help the GPE national team win the 18-and-under World Cup in Taiwan.While there's some doubt as to whether top-rated prep catching prospect PERSON will stay behind the plate, there are no such concerns with PERSON. The ORGANIZATION recruit is athletic for a backstop and moves well behind the plate. He has a strong arm, and once he gets accustomed to handling pro-caliber pitchers, he should become a solid receiver.PERSON can hit, too. He has a quick bat that produces line drives to all fields, and he's strong enough to develop average power. As a bonus, he runs better than most catchers.",0
"A shortstop in high school, PERSON was moved behind the plate immediately after the PERSON drafted him in 2010 and he's developed into a solid catching prospect. He's come a long way defensively, with an above-average arm and good agility while showing solid leadership skills. Though he was named an All-Star each of the past two seasons, PERSON has seen a decline in his offensive production. He still has the ability to make consistent hard contact to all fields and runs better than most catchers. The more time he gets behind the plate, the better he looks, with all signs pointing to a gig as an everyday backstop in the future.",1
"The ORGANIZATION' most expensive pickup during the 2012-13 international signing period, PERSON received a $420,000 bonus to turn pro out of the ORGANIZATION. Though he didn't tear it up in his professional debut in 2013, his advanced feel for the game made PERSON comfortable enough to send him to low Class A this season as an 18-year-old, and he held his own. Some scouts from other organizations thought he was PERSON's top prospect, and his value showed when he became a key piece in the blockbuster deal that delivered PERSON to the ORGANIZATION as the ORGANIZATION Deadline.The youngest everyday player in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON has maintained his patient approach at the plate. His bat speed portends average power once he adds more strength, and he could be a solid hitter once he makes more consistent contact. After seeing time at third base in 2013, PERSON has played exclusively at shortstop this year. He has the hands and arm strength to remain there, though he lacks the quickness desired at the position and could move to second or third base down the road.",1
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $2 million just before the clock struck midnight on the 2015-2016 ORGANIZATION Agent signing period, then traded him to PERSON for PERSON a few weeks later, before PERSON had even played a pro game. PERSON took things slow for the first year 10 months, and left PERSON in the ORGANIZATION in 2016 and in GPE Spring Training to start 2017, but he has moved very quickly since then, climbing to a new minor league level every half season. And he has performed. PERSON is a career .301/.381/.507 hitter in the minors, has always been young relative to his level, and reached Triple-A last year shortly after he turned 21. He has big, all-fields raw power, and balls he mis-hits will often still find their way to the warning track. While PERSON has good natural timing in the box and isn't often fooled by breaking stuff, he does have limited bat control and we anticipate his batting averages will be lower in majors than they have been thus far. 
ORGANIZATION for his size, PERSON has mostly played left field as a pro and he's a 40 runner underway, but he appeared to stiffen last year and most teams have him projected to first base or DH. That will limit his overall value and makes his lack of bat control a little scary, but we still think PERSON will become an average regular, and possibly get an opportunity quite soon.",1
"It's not abundantly clear whether or not PERSON will be able to catch as, at age 18, he's already a pretty big, long-levered kid who was initially unsure if he even wanted to try it. But PERSON can really hit. He has excellent timing, bat control, and feel for all-fields contact, and he can open up and get his barrel on pitches inside. He might end up at first base or in an outfield corner, but he might hit enough to profile at those spots and if he can catch, his ceiling is sizable.",0
" GPE is the kind of prospect who sneaks up on people. He doesn't wow you with any particular skill, but you can't help but like him more the more you see him play. That doesn't mean he doesn't have tools. He led the FACILITY organization in batting average and hits while playing at three levels in 2012. He then played 112 games with Triple-A Charlotte in 2013, but posted only a .241/.293/.296 slash line. The 2012 PERSON is a hard-nosed player who can spray line drives all over the field from both sides of the plate. He is capable of playing three infield positions and handles either up-the-middle spot capably. He may not have the highest ceiling in the world, but he's the kind of player who finds his way onto winning ballclubs.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
" GPE comes from GPE, a small Division II school, so he's going to need some time and experience to develop, but the ORGANIZATION feel he has the chance to be a frontline starter when all is said and done. He has the makings of a very good three-pitch mix, with his sinking fastball that generates many groundball outs and his slider both with the chance to be above-average. He's shown some feel for his changeup as well. He'll need to improve his command to reach his ceiling, but more than anything he just needs to go out and pitch.",0
" ORGANIZATION of GPE shortstop PERSON created most of the buzz on campus in 2015, and was a first-round pick. But PERSON more than made a name for himself with a consistent performance as the ORGANIZATION' Friday night starter, resulting in his fourth-round selection.PERSON moved around during his college career, starting at ORGANIZATION, moving to PERSON as a sophomore, then moving to GPE for his junior year. He might not have wow stuff, but what he has was really good in 2015, all coming from an easy, simple delivery. He pitches off his fastball, which is a tick above-average sitting in the 92-94 mph range, and it plays up because of his feel for the strike zone. His slider has been a bit inconsistent, but he's shown it can be a solid breaking ball in the past. His changeup needs some refinement and looks kind of like a hybrid splitter-type pitch. PERSON will need to improve his third pitch to continue to have success at the pro level, but he has the makings of a solid, innings-eating starter.",0
"A native of PERSON's River, GPE, PERSON has spent the last two years up the FACILITY at FACILITY. After an up-and-down freshman campaign, PERSON has been dominant as a sophomore, moving up the ranks of top junior college talent in the 2019 Draft class.PERSON certainly looks the part, with a strong, physical 6-foot-6 frame and a clean arm action and left-handed delivery. He'll be up to 94 mph consistently with his fastball, though not with a ton of deception as hitters can pick the ball up early because of a slightly lower slot. PERSON does flash a solid breaking ball, but tends not to get on top of it. He'll try to throw a cutter and a slider as well, but can get caught between them and either needs to stick with the slider because of his arm slot being so far away from his head or raise his slot a little and go with the curveball. The changeup is below-average right now, but there is some feel for it with the hopes of it become a viable option once he starts throwing it more. PERSON had originally committed to GPE PERSON's before switching to GPE, and he would head to PERSON should the Draft not work out. His left-handedness, plus body and high ceiling could make a team take him early enough to keep him from heading to GPE.",0
"GPE flock to the ORGANIZATION in GPE every year to get the chance to see the top talent the island has to offer prior to the ORGANIZATION. ORGANIZATION, a middle infielder with some present hitting skills, was the only player to hit homer in this year's event.Big and strong, ORGANIZATION has more present strength than some of his fellow PERSON infielders in the class. When he keeps his swing under control, he can drive the ball. He has serious raw power, especially to the pull side, but has the tendency to lose his mechanics and get out of control trying to show off that power. A solid runner when underway, there is some question over whether he has the range to stick at shortstop, though most teams would send him out at the spot and see if he can stick there. He has a plus arm and good enough hands for the position.If ORGANIZATION does slow down as he matures, he still has a future on the dirt, perhaps as an offensive second baseman. Some scouts think he'll hit enough to profile at third base, reminding some of an Asdrubal Cabrera type. He'll head to GPE PERSON if the ORGANIZATION doesn't work out for him.",0
"While the ORGANIZATION lost PERSON to free agency prior to the 2015 season, they did get the 34th overall pick in that year's Draft as compensation. That turned out to be PERSON, who has shown that his power output at ORGANIZATION was not an aberration, with big home run totals in each of his first two full seasons. PERSON has legitimate pop to all fields thanks to a very quick bat. While there is some swing and miss to his game, he has worked hard at shortening his swing and developing a better plan at the plate. He has shown some ability to draw walks, helping somewhat to offset the strikeout rate. His bat will have to be his carrying card because he is a below-average defender in left field. He has limited speed and a below-average arm, but the ORGANIZATION feel he'll eventually be adequate out there. The ORGANIZATION will live with fringy defense as PERSON continues to show he can punish the baseball at the upper levels of the system. If he continues to develop, he could be a left-handed-hitting middle-of-the-order run producer in the near future.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 4, 2017 - PERSON, Calif.Favorite ORGANIZATION Team: GPE ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION Player: PERSON, a 6-foot-4 outfielder from GPE, has committed to play for ORGANIZATION. He was a 2015 ORGANIZATION and made the 2016 Underclass 1st Team. Thanks to his impressive play at ORGANIZATION, he was also able to showcase his skills at the ORGANIZATION Games.Ward's father, GPE, played football for PERSON and some scouts have said that Je'Von inherited his quickness. The outfielder took part in ORGANIZATION's FACILITY and honed his skills at ORGANIZATION's Breakthrough Series camp as well, where he was mentored by former ORGANIZATION star PERSON.",0
"The LOCATION freshman of the year and batting champion (.408) in 2016, PERSON hasn't quite matched that production since but has continued to catalyze PERSON's lineup the last two years. PERSON-eligible as a 21-year-old sophomore in 2017, he turned down the ORGANIZATION as a 30th-round pick, lasting that long only because of questionable signability. He may have the best football family in this year's PERSON, as his grandfather PERSON, father PERSON and uncle Kris all played professionally.PERSON's best tool is his speed, which grades as plus-plus out of the batter's box but doesn't play quite that fast and hasn't translated into elite basestealing or defensive ability. A switch-hitter, he concentrates on making contact and getting on base, an approach that leaves him with almost no power. He's doing a better job of working counts and drawing walks as a junior, though he still needs more patience to become a true tablesetter.PERSON also has improved his jumps and reads this year, making him a solid defender in center field. He has a stronger arm than most players at his position, having reached 93 mph with his fastball when he started five games on the mound as a sophomore. He proved his grit by playing through a broken left hand for much of last season.",0
GPE has moved to the bullpen and upped the usage of his mid-90s fastball and above-average slider. He's a big league-ready relief piece.,1
"A transfer from PERSON (Fla.), PERSON had a so-so debut campaign for GSP in 2015. But he really put himself on the map in 2016, showing the kind of offensive profile that could fit well in an outfield corner at the next level, and the PERSON made him their third-round pick in June.The right-handed-hitting GPE uses a short and handsy swing to consistently make the ball jump off his bat. PERSON doesn't waste a lot of motion and has shown both the ability to hit for average and power, albeit it in a weaker conference. It might be more gap pop at the next level, although PERSON has shown some over-the-fence ability in the past. Defensively, his plus arm also profiles well in right field, where he is a very capable defender.PERSON possesses the tools to be an everyday corner outfielder. At worst, he could be a very productive fourth outfielder at the big league level.",1
"ORGANIZATION stood out early in his high school career outside GPE, ORGANIZATION as a regular on the showcase circuit who was often the best player on the field at high profile events while also being the youngest. He had mostly solid average tools and good feel through the middle of his prep career. Then in his senior year, the arm strength, raw power, and bat speed all became plus, and he was the odds on favorite to go first overall. But PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, and fellow GPE prep hitter PERSON all took steps forward in the spring, and the ORGANIZATION were able to get ORGANIZATION third overall. 
In pro ball, ORGANIZATION has benefitted form the ORGANIZATION' affiliates being extreme hitters' environments, which has mostly obscured in the surface stats the fact that ORGANIZATION pitch selection is below average. It improved a bit in his second taste of Double-A in 2018, then became an issue again in his late-season promotion to Triple-A. He's fringy at shortstop and as a runner, so most scouts see him sliding over to second base long-term, but he's good enough to play shortstop everyday if a club doesn't have better options and focuses on shifting and positioning around him. There's enough here that it's likely ORGANIZATION is a solid everyday player of some sort in 2020, but he may not be the star that some have anticipated.",1
"GPE, physically mature and athletic, PERSON was bringing scouts to GPE because of his three-pitch mix and his pitchability. The high schooler, who has committed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE, will throw his fastball up to 92 mph consistently. When his mechanics on his curveball are solid, it's an above-average strikeout pitch. And his changeup will show flashes of having some sink with good arm speed. He goes right after hitters and works quickly, always a plus. He may not be the tall, thin projectable type, but what he is right now is already good enough to warrant early-round attention.",0
"GPE has had five first-round or supplemental first-round picks in the past three GPE, and the club has spent four of those picks on infielders. The latest infielder selected was PERSON, who wowed the A's in a workout shortly before the GPE. He went 25th overall and he signed for $1.75 million.PERSON fits the third-base profile to a tee, as he possesses the power potential and arm strength teams want at the position. PERSON manages the strike zone well, and while he can be inconsistent at times, he's doing a better job of turning his batting-practice power into home runs during games.PERSON has Gold PERSON upside at the hot corner. He moves well at third base and he has a cannon of an arm that has produced fastballs up to 98 mph in limited stints on the mound. PERSON is reminiscent of PERSON, another Cal State PERSON star who gave up playing the outfield to become a full-time pitcher after the ORGANIZATION made him a supplemental first-round choice in 2013.",1
" While there are many catching prospects who are offensive-first type backstops, GPE is the other way around. The GPE native gets raves reviews for his defensive toolset. He has a plus arm, one of the best among PERSON catchers, and gets rid of the ball quickly. His athleticism leads to excellent agility behind the plate, with an ability to sit and block pitches in the dirt. His bat is behind his glove, though he's shown glimpses of offensive ability as well. He has a line-drive swing with gap power. There might be more pop if he can refine his approach. That's been GPE's biggest shortcoming, a tendency to chase pitches. Still very young, GPE has the potential to develop into an everyday backstop, especially if the bat comes along.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"As a junior, PERSON hit an extra-inning home run to give PERSON (GPE) the 2015 Missouri state Class 3 baseball championship, but he otherwise drew little attention at his small-town school. After a modest freshman season at ORGANIZATION, he made a run at the Big East Conference triple crown in 2018 and continued to produce in the ORGANIZATION during the summer. He has been streakier at the plate this spring, costing him a chance to join PERSON (ORGANIZATION. 13 overall in 1992) as the only ORGANIZATION position players ever selected in the first round.Omaha's ORGANIZATION is one of the toughest places to hit a home run in college baseball, yet it hasn't been able to contain PERSON, whose short, quick left-handed stroke and strength give him some of the best power in the 2019 college crop. He lets his home runs come naturally rather than swinging for the fences, making repeated contact that could allow him to hit for average as well. To do so, scouts believe he'll need to get more upright in his stance like he was in the past before getting too spread out as a junior.PERSON has below-average speed out of the batter's box but is closer to average once he gets going. He needs to improve his defensive instincts and his arm is merely average, so he could shift from right field at ORGANIZATION to left field in pro ball. His all-around profile is similar to that of PERSON Series hero PERSON, whom the ORGANIZATION drafted 20th overall out of GPE State last June, though PERSON had a more impressive junior season.",0
"PERSON signed for $1 million out of GPE in 2017. He can really pick it at shortstop and could be plus there at maturity. His hands, range, actions, footwork, and athleticism are all superlative, especially considering his age, and while he is phsyically projectable, he's not so big-framed that he's a threat to move off shortstop. PERSON's defensive ability was in place when he arrived for camp in the spring. By the start of the summer, he had already filled out a bit and started putting a serious charge into the baseball during BP and, occasionally, in games. That thump tapered off later in the year and PERSON has some swing length issues that will likely make him strikeout prone, but it's possible he was just tired in GPE and that there's some pop here, too. It's unlikely that he has a well-rounded, impact profile on offense, but he could be a plus glove at short who also runs into 15-plus bombs if that power develops.",0
"GPE was one of the most improved players in the LOCATION last year and continued to hit with wood bats in the ORGANIZATION. His all-around game gave hm a chance to become the first position player taken in the first round out of GPE since PERSON went 15th overall in 2001, but his awful first half of his junior season at the plate has confounded scouts. He spread out too much in his stance, slowing his bat and creating holes in his swing.His offensive profile is different than that of most shortstops in that GPE's power stands out more than his hitting ability. He has an unconventional right-handed swing and an overly aggressive approach, but his bat speed and deceptive strength give him surprising pop for his size and position. He has plus speed but still is learning how to turn it into stolen bases.GPE's quick hands work well in the field. He still can smooth some things at shortstop, but he covers ground and has the solid arm to make all the necessary throws. He needs more offensive and defensive refinement than a typical college prospect but has the upside of an up-the-middle guy with 20-20 potential if he can recapture his 2018 swing.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 14, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON, an GPE commit, was named to the ORGANIZATION Prospect List, and he was also awarded with a 2015 Perfect Game Underclass Honorable Mention and the 2016 Perfect Game Underclass High Honorable Mention.The LaGrange, Ga., native is a smooth infielder with an average arm and soft glove, making his defense serviceable up the middle.At the plate, PERSON flashes a solid swing and hitting approach, with the ability to drive the ball into the gaps and center.",0
"The son of former big league outfielder PERSON, PERSON was coached by his father at ORGANIZATION's PERSON before attending PERSON. He topped ORGANIZATION Division I with 84 ORGANIZATION and the ORGANIZATION with 21 homers in 2017 -- both the second-highest totals in school history -- before signing for an over-slot $2 million as a second-rounder that June. He hit just 10 homers and slugged .404 in his first two seasons but started to show more power midway through 2019.When Sheets was an amateur, there were some questions about whether he had enough bat speed to punish quality fastballs. The FACILITY Sox believe more home runs will come as he starts incorporating his legs more in his left-handed swing and makes an adjustment to stop hooking balls foul down the right-field line. He has a smooth stroke and controls the strike zone well for a big man, so he should hit for average and draw a healthy amount of walks.Sheets moves well for a 6-foot-4, 230-pounder, though his speed is still well below average. He has worked diligently to make himself into an average defender at first base. He has soft hands and a strong arm that is an asset on 3-6-3 double plays.",0
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $35,000 as a 24th-round pick in 2013 after he had spent three years in LOCATION's starting rotation. He broke out the next year, when he was the Rookie-level PERSON of the Year and broke PERSON's Class A Great Lakes single-game strikeout record with 14. He led the Minors in whiffs per nine innings (12.8) in 2015, then dominated Triple-A and made his big league debut with the ORGANIZATION in '16, only to be traded to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for PERSON during the offseason. Though he would make his ORGANIZATION debut in May, PERSON spent much of 2017 on the shelf with right forearm and lat strains and had his entire '18 campaign wiped out by PERSON surgery. He made a healthy return to the mound in the ORGANIZATION State League this May before joining Triple-A PERSON's starting rotation. PERSON's rash of injuries impacted his velocity, and he was sitting in the 88-92 mph range upon joining the ORGANIZATION after previously working at 92-94 and bumping 96. Since returning from ORGANIZATION surgery, the right-hander has been consistently 91-95 mph and throwing his heater with late life up in the zone. PERSON's changeup is still his his best secondary pitch, a legitimate plus offering that plays nicely off of his fastball, and he also throws a slider that's effective when he gets right-handers to chase it off the plate.PERSON has a strong track record as a strike-thrower, though it likely will take him some time to regain the control and command he had before his myriad injuries. He still has the upside of a big league starter, at this point likely a No. 4 or No. 5, though he'll need to stay healthy in order to achieve such potential.",1
"GPE is a plus defensive CF right now and has been working on ways to use his speed to reach base since he arrived in pro ball, because he doesn't have good feel to hit. It's working, and he's performing this year, though he is old for the level. He might be an everyday player because of his glove, but probably won't make a huge offensive impact, if any.",0
"The D-backs knew that PERSON, a second rounder in the 2014 Draft from the ORGANIZATION high school ranks, might be a bit of a project as he entered pro ball. He proved that by getting off to a good start in full season ball in 2016 before struggling with a promotion to the GPE League before getting shut down with a dead arm in July. His ability to learn from that, reach the GPE League again in 2017, and have success, is a sign he's pointed in the right direction. PERSON offers decent stuff with a good feel of how to use it. His fastball backed up a little bit from his high school days, but it's still an average offering he can command well. His slider will show glimpses of being a sharp above-average breaking ball and he is capable of throwing his changeup with some fade. His command and control improved in 2017. Still very young, PERSON is still figuring things out. A few years down the road, he'd push through that dead arm period, but the organization felt there was no reason to at this juncture. Learning to prepare and stay strong through a full season has been a key in the 2017 campaign.",1
"A senior sign out of GPE in the 22nd round of the 2014 Draft, PERSON has already far exceeded expectations as a reliever getting close to knocking on the big league door. A sidearmer/underarmer, PERSON will throw his fastball in the 89-91 mph range from that arm slot. He throws it with heavy sink to generate a ton of ground-ball outs. He mixes in a very good changeup as well and then, to give hitters a surprising look, he'll go high three-quarters with his arm slot and deliver a 94 mph downhill fastball to miss bats. His breaking stuff is below average, but he commands his other stuff so well, it doesn't really matter. PERSON has proven himself every step of the way, including a promotion up to Double-A in 2016. While he's closed games since joining the organization -- he led the ORGANIZATION system in saves in 2015 -- his ceiling is probably that of a middle reliever, but it's one he's close to reaching.",0
"PERSON's velocity (mostly 91-94, flat at times) and command have backed up a bit this year but they're still at least average, his slider has retained plus projection and he has a chance at a viable three-pitch mix, though the changeup is firm and clearly below average right now. There are concerns about injury, not necessarily due to PERSON's unique delivery but rather because he had arthroscopic surgery on both of his knees last fall. He has looked more like an average big league starter this spring but if the velo spikes back up in pro ball he has more of a mid-rotation profile.",0
"The Indians have challenged PERSON with aggressive assignments since signing him out of the ORGANIZATION in July 2013. He made his pro debut in the Rookie-level PERSON and advanced to ORGANIZATION A Short PERSON in 2015, where, for the second straight year, he was the youngest player on his team's roster. PERSON earned PERSON All-Star honors in 2016 during his full-season debut at ORGANIZATION A Lake County, and he garnered All-Star honors for a second straight year in '17 in the ORGANIZATION. A plus athlete with exciting tools, the switch-hitting PERSON stands out on both sides of the ball. At the plate, he has feel for hitting from both sides, with good bat-to-ball skills and a line-drive-oriented swing. He shows good power to the gaps, with above-average speed that nets him plenty of doubles and triples, and scouts expect him to start clearing more fences as he grows into his wiry-athletic frame.PERSON has played shortstop exclusively since the start of 2015 after splitting time between both middle-infield positions in his pro debut. The chances he creates with his plus range played a part in his 25 errors in 2016, though he also was erratic at times and struggled to control his body. PERSON should improve in that regard as he gains experience, and he has the necessary soft hands, range and arm strength to remain at the position long term.",1
"Shortstops who can stay at the position are hard to come by, so when one does, especially one with some potential with the bat, they tend to get a lot of attention. Case in point: No. 1 overall pick PERSON in 2012 and first-rounder PERSON the year prior. In 2013, the honor of being the top high school shortstop will go to Mercado.He has very good actions at shortstop, with no question about his ability to defend at the premium spot. He'll need to add some strength, but he also showed some offensive ability over the summer, standing out at the LOCATION Pro Showcase. His potential and his glove work will undoubtedly put him high up on GPE boards in June.",0
"While baseball is certainly a results-oriented game, sometimes it pays to be patient. Case in point is PERSON, who took a big step forward in turning raw talent into production in 2014. The left-handed outfielder showed an ability to hit for both average and power in his season in the GPE. He cut down on his strikeouts, allowing him to make more consistent contact and start tapping into his raw power. There could be more to come, and PERSON reported to Spring Training in 2015 with at least 15 pounds of added muscle. PERSON possessing excellent speed and basestealing instincts, he should be able to use that added strength to be an even greater threat. PERSON has a very strong throwing arm and his speed allows him to cover plenty of ground in both center and right field. PERSON needed to show that his breakout wasn't a GPE mirage and he was solid, albeit unspectacular in the move to Double-A. With continued improvement with his approach at the plate, he could begin reaching his enormous upside potential.",1
"PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION as a 16-year-old out of the ORGANIZATION last year. He showed off his loose, easy swing and power potential in the ORGANIZATION before signing. PERSON projects to hit for a high average and is expected to add power as he fills out his 6-foot-1, 175-pound frame. PERSON profiles as a right fielder, but he is a long way from GPE. He made his professional debut this year in the ORGANIZATION, where he had a .271 average in 192 at-bats.",0
"PERSON worked almost exclusively out of the bullpen during his first two years at PERSON, but a move to the rotation in the ORGANIZATION last summer opened a lot of eyes and had many wondering if he could start long-term at the next level. Hopes to see him in that role during his junior year were dashed when he returned to a relief role.The right-hander has been effective as PERSON's closer this spring, though his stuff has backed up a bit. He was up to 95 mph in the GPE, albeit early in starts, but he's been mostly sitting 90-91 mph this spring, occasionally hitting 92-93 on the gun. His curveball remains effective and is his go-to out pitch, showing the ability to miss bats with it at times. His changeup had always been a distant third pitch, but it's largely been collecting dust on the shelf in his current role. There is some effort to his delivery, resulting in inconsistent command as well as an inability to maintain his velocity deeper into outings when he was starting.PERSON has the strength and body to be a rotation workhorse and a team that thinks it can help him refine his delivery might draft him in the top few rounds and send him out in a rotation. He could be an effective setup type reliever, especially if the velocity can return.",0
"Based on his 2014 performance in the summer Prospect League and fall practice at ORGANIZATION, PERSON looked like a top-three-rounds pick for 2015. But his stuff regressed as a Draft-eligible sophomore, dropping him to the sixth round in June. He signed for an above-slot $320,000.After touching 96 mph with his fastball the year before, PERSON usually worked at 88-92 during the spring. His heater doesn't feature a lot of life or plane, so he relies on the additional velocity to miss bats.PERSON also got away from using what had been a low-80s slider with nice tilt, but both his curveball and changeup have shown signs of becoming solid or better pitches since he turned pro. He throws strikes but his command is just OK and he lacks classic starter size, so he could end up in the bullpen down the road.",0
"Most conversations about PERSON begin with his bat, and for good reason. He has the chance to hit his way to the big leagues.PERSON has already shown the ability to hit for average from the left side of the plate, with an advanced approach and a smooth left-handed swing. There's more power to come, and it should be noted that PERSON had the same amount of home runs with PERSON that PERSON hit there, and PERSON did it in fewer games. While he will never be known for his glovework, the ORGANIZATION feel PERSON has gotten a bad rap for his defense and that he is more than just a bat being hidden in left field.That said, PERSON's ability to swing the bat is his calling card, and he has the chance to develop into a run producer at the highest level.",1
"PERSON was seen as a decent high school prospect heading into his senior year of high school when he took PERSON deep at the ORGANIZATION Invitational at the ORGANIZATION complex in March 2012. That helped him to climb into the third round and the ORGANIZATION were able to keep him from attending the ORGANIZATION of GPE. A solid defender with good speed, PERSON has a decent feel for the game and good instincts, though it remains to be seen if he'll stay at short. He had a solid summer debut that included a brief stop with full-season Delmarva. If he can improve his approach at the plate and on-base skills, he could be a future top-of-the-order type hitter.",0
"PERSON was a star high school running back, but unlike many two-sport prospects playing baseball, his game isn't flashy or out of control. PERSON's blood runs cold and he always looks comfortable at the plate. His approach to contact is pretty conservative and he lets the strength and umph in his hands generate his in-game power, much like PERSON. He also has a great eye for the striek zone, like PERSON. PERSON's arm may limit him to left field.",0
"PERSON PERSON's cap another 15 degrees and he's a dead on-mound ringer for PERSON. Right now, he just throws tailing heat past hitters, but he has some nascent changeup feel and his arm speed and loose, rhythmic delivery makes one comfortable projecting on the changeup. His breaking ball is good enough to miss bats when it's located. PERSON hasn't harnessed his limbs or his release point yet, so you have to project pretty heavily on his command to buy that the slider will play one day, and that he'll throw enough strikes to start. If that happens, he could be a No. 4 starter. If it doesn't, a bullpen role will be determined by his changeup quality.",0
"PERSON had $1 million evaluations on GPE when he was in high school, just about half a million shy of what it likely would have taken to sign him. He matriculated to PERSON, where his abilities sufficed to push phenom PERSON over to second base. Indeed GPE is the rare college player who scouts saw as capable of playing shortstop. He's a plus-plus runner with a plus arm, and infield-worthy footwork and actions. Neither acrobatic nor sexy in any way, GPE's look as a defender, and his overall profile, has been compared to J.J. PERSON's. Like PERSON, GPE also has some power but his college swing likely needs to be altered for him to get to it in games. With player development now firmly ensconced in the era of swing changes, it seems reasonable to anticipate that GPE will make some adjustments. The track record for college shortstops is not great, but GPE has everyday tools.",0
"Back in 2011, a young shortstop came out of ORGANIZATION in GPE and ended up going No. 8 overall to the ORGANIZATION. While he had a long way to go before earning a true comp to All-Star Francisco Lindor, PERSON' strong summer had him brought up in the conversation for more reasons than just attending the same high school, though an uneven spring has cooled his projections considerably.The raw tools are still there for PERSON to be a successful middle infielder at the next level, but he hasn't put them to consistent use in his senior year. He has plus raw power and has shown the wherewithal to tap into it in games at times in the past. He hasn't shown the same advanced approach he had over the summer, but the skills are there to hit for average and tap into that raw power. Relatively new to switch-hitting, his left-handed swing needs work. PERSON has a very strong arm and good hands, which gives him the chance to stick at short. His lack of speed could eventually necessitate a move to third.PERSON' summer moved him way up on GPE lists and raised the level of expectations considerably, but he didn't come out and perform as hoped this spring. A team that feels it can help him unlock those raw tools consistently will still take him early enough to keep him from heading to PERSON.",0
"PERSON drew increased attention as the ORGANIZATION approached because he has one of the better curveballs in the GPE and he's relatively signable for a high school player. Committed to GPE (Mo.) JC, he's expected to turn pro.When PERSON stays on top of his curve, it has true 12-to-6 shape with tight bite and approaches 80 mph. It lacks consistency but has obvious upside. He also can push his fastball to 93 mph with some armside run, generating downhill plane with his high-three-quarters delivery.PERSON's changeup lags well behind his other two pitches and will have to improve for him to remain a starter. His control and command will require refinement as well. He's athletic and has a decent delivery.",0
"When you watch GPE (video link above) the first things you should notice are his large stature and slightly awkward arm action and release. He has better feel than you'd guess for repeating his delivery, throwing his sinker down in the zone, and manipulating his slider, so you can see why he had good numbers across three levels in 2018 as a starter. There aren't a ton of starters who look like this or pitch like this in the big leagues. Pitchers whose best skill is locating a good slider (like ORGANIZATION recent first rounder PERSON, who drew PERSON comps from scouts) are often put in relief, though secondary-pitch heavy usage is now more common with guys in a rotation. The ceiling here seems like a No. 4 starter if you squint; a realistic outcome is more like a 7th inning reliever who can go multiple innings and get by with fringy velocity.",0
"GPE of the return from the ORGANIZATION in the December 2014 PERSON trade, PERSON missed nearly two years recovering from PERSON surgery. He started slowly in his return to GPE in 2016, but finished as a dominant starter in the LOCATION champion's rotation. A double-jump to Double-A in 2017 with many from that staff has not gone well.PERSON's fastball sits 93-94 mph, though he showed late last year he can reach back for more when he needed it. His curve is his out pitch and can be one of the best breaking balls in the Minors at times. His feel for his changeup had improved, giving him the makings of three average or better weapons at his disposal.With the move to the upper levels, PERSON's command has regressed, both in and out of the strike zone. He's now ahead of the curve age-wise for his level, so a repeat in level wouldn't set him back too much.",1
"Known for his good hands and strong arm, PERSON is one of the best all-around prospects from GPE in this year's class.While he has the skill set and strength to move to third base, there's a belief that the teenager will stick at shortstop because of his athleticism, solid defensive actions and reliable glove. He's also known for his good footwork and ability to make the routine and extraordinary plays.The switch-hitting PERSON makes hard contact from both sides of the plate and has shown good bat speed and some power at the plate. Like most prospects his age, PERSON's hitting mechanics will improve once he signs with a team and enters the club's academy, but he has already shown the potential to hit for average.PERSON, who trains with PERSON of GPE, GPE, has been compared to younger version of former ORGANIZATION shortstop PERSON. The ORGANIZATION are the favorite to sign the teenage shortstop.",0
"PERSON originally planned on splitting his time between baseball and basketball at ORGANIZATION (Calif.) JC before deciding to concentrate on the diamond. That proved to be a wise move as he blossomed into a first-rounder after a year at ORGANIZATION and two at FACILITY, signing for $1.8 million as the 30th overall choice in 2015.The best defensive player in last year's draft and the best defensive shortstop to come out of college baseball in years, PERSON is a ORGANIZATION Glover waiting to happen. The athleticism that made him a standout shooting guard in hoops translates into outstanding quickness, range, hands and footwork. He has a solid arm and led short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League shortstops with a .970 fielding percentage in his pro debut.Concerns about PERSON's offense prevented him from going higher in the GPE, and he didn't put them to rest by posting a .527 OPS in the NY-P. Scouts question his bat speed and he might not be more than a contact hitter who infrequently drives the ball or draws walks. The ORGANIZATION worked to improve his load during instructional league, but even if he improves he'd probably destined for the bottom of a batting order.",0
"Since 2003, PERSON has produced nine big league arms and 12 pitchers taken in the top five rounds of the GPE, most notably PERSON and PERSON. PERSON will add to the latter list this June and is a safe bet to add to the former in a couple of years. He's a left-hander with three effective pitches and a history of success in a variety of roles, not to mention competitiveness and confidence that are off the charts.PERSON usually operates at 89-91 mph with run and sink on his fastball from a lower three-quarters arm angle, though he can raise his slot and reach back for 93-95 mph when needed. He has tremendous feel for manipulating the shape of his high-spin slider, which ranges from 78-83 mph and is a plus pitch at its best. He also has advanced feel for a sinking changeup that he'll throw in any count.PERSON's stocky frame and crossfire delivery aren't pretty but his stuff plays up because of the angle and extension he creates and his willingness to attack hitters. He not only throws strikes, but he'll also use any pitch in any count and work inside against left-handers and right-handers. He has one of the higher floors among college pitchers in this GPE, projecting as at least a lefty reliever at the ORGANIZATION level, and his deception and conviction could carry him to a role at the back of a rotation.",0
"In 2015, PERSON was drafted out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE in the fifth round of the 2015 PERSON by the ORGANIZATION. Now it's his younger brother's turn. While PERSON is a pure-hitting corner outfielder/first baseman, GPE is a fleet-footed center fielder whose PERSON stock initially took a hit when a broken wrist forced him out of action for much of his junior seasonÂ¸ though a healthy return to action had him headed back up boards as the PERSON approached.ORGANIZATION moved into the starting lineup as a sophomore and promptly hit .338 with a .425 on-base percentage and an ACC-leading 27 steals in 29 attempts. While he didn't hit well playing for PERSON over the summer, he did find his footing with a solid late stretch in the ORGANIZATION. Some scouts aren't in love with his swing, which features a flat bat path, but others point to a pretty good track record of making consistent hard contact. He hasn't hit for much power to speak of, but some changes to his mechanics could allow him to tap into his raw pop at the next level. He has a fringy arm, but has the speed and instincts to play center field.There are some evaluators who see ORGANIZATION as a ORGANIZATION type while others think he's similar offensively to 2017 first-rounder PERSON. Either way, there's a good chance he'll beat his brother's PERSON slot by quite a bit in June even despite the injury.",0
"Back in July 2012, PERSON was No. 17 on MLB.com's Top 20 International prospects list heading into that summer's signing period. The top-ranked catcher in the class signed with the Phillies for $575,000 and made his debut the next summer in the ORGANIZATION. It's been slow going since, especially with the bat, but he made progress in that regard in 2018 in Double-A Reading and he kept it going with a move to Triple-A in 2019.PERSON has always had raw power, but it didn't really start showing up in games until last year when he hit 21 homers for Reading. He kept up his ability to impact the baseball with extra-base authority as he moved up a rung, showing that it was more than a result of his hitting-friendly environment in 2018. He's always been an aggressive hitter, albeit one who typically hasn't struck out a lot. His best defensive attribute is his cannon for an arm, though his lack of agility does limit his defensive value.With as long as a route as it's been for PERSON, he's still only 23 for all of the 2019 season. He might have a ceiling as a backup, but he's not far from reaching it and could finally earn a spot on the 40-man roster, either with a callup or being added after the 2019 season is over.",0
"Not to be confused with the ORGANIZATION PERSON the ORGANIZATION traded PERSON for back in 2008, this version signed out of the ORGANIZATION Republic two years later. He enjoyed a breakout 2015 season in low Class A, and when PERSON was sidelined by a sore shoulder, PERSON represented PERSON in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON. In December, the Rockies traded PERSON to the ORGANIZATION after selecting him in the ORGANIZATION phase of the Rule 5 Draft.PERSON struggled when he first reached full-season ball the year before. He credits his success to raising his arm slot and doing a better job of repeating it. He now delivers all three of his pitches from the same angle and controls and commands them better than he did in the past.PERSON possessed an 86-88 mph fastball when he signed, but he has gotten much stronger and now works at 93-95 mph and touches 97. He has a hard breaking ball that's more of a slider than a curveball and can climb into the mid 80s. He also has feel for throwing a changeup, enhancing his chances of remaining a starter as he advances.",1
"When the ORGANIZATION decided to move PERSON, who was initially drafted as a third baseman, behind the plate, they knew the process might take a while. But they hoped eventually he could develop into a potential replacement for PERSON. It's looking more and more likely that their patience will be rewarded.With a tireless work ethic, PERSON has turned himself into a premium defender behind the plate, one who looks like he's been back there for years. He has a plus arm that has thrown out almost a third of would-be base-stealers since he switched positions. He has outstanding hands and footwork, the type of backstop who could win ORGANIZATION in the future, and he is the kind of natural leader teams love to have behind the plate. In 2016, his bat started to catch up to his glove. He has some raw power and has really improved his approach and pitch selection, where it looks like he should be able to hit for average and power in the future.PERSON made it up to the big leagues for the first time in 2016, and said the experience was invaluable. He appeared more than ready to take over in GPE after GPE's contract was set to expire following the 2017 season, but the veteran's extension through 2020 clouds PERSON's future with the ORGANIZATION.",1
"At the start of the GPE season, scouts get to watch top talent in warm-weather climates like GPE and GPE. As the spring warms up, which has been slow to happen in 2018, prepsters in places like the ORGANIZATION start to pop up as they can really get going. PERSON has been the case with PERSON, who was dominating high school competition, including a 17-strikeout perfect game, even with it still being cold and rainy in GPE and physically mature, PERSON has been a man amongst boys in his senior season. His fastball sits easily in the 91-92 mph range and is consistently up to 93-95 mph. He commands the fastball and his solid curveball very well, giving high school hitters little chance of success. He shows good arm speed on his changeup, throwing it with fading sink, though he doesn't have to throw it often. He also has a slider, which is behind his curve, a solid pitch that could get shelved as a pro.While PERSON isn't projectable in terms of adding strength, there is growth to come in terms of refining his already-solid stuff under pro tutelage. Committed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE, PERSON's name has been popping up in top three rounds conversations.",0
"Like many high schoolers, PERSON made the rounds over this past summer, playing in the ORGANIZATION, the LOCATION Pro Showcase, the Under PERSON All-American Game and the ORGANIZATION All-American Classic.His performance this spring has been just OK, but there's still a lot to like with one of the youngest players in the GPE class.Big and strong, PERSON has tremendous raw power as a left-handed hitter and will put on some ridiculous BP sessions. It doesn't always show up in games, though, and he doesn't show confidence on the field consistently.He has tools, but he's still raw and will still be only 17 on GPE day. A team who thinks those tools will develop will take a chance on him in June.",1
"After spending two seasons in the Class A ORGANIZATION, ORGANIZATION finally moved up to the ORGANIZATION State League in 2015 and was throwing well there when he took a comebacker off his forearm, forcing him off the mound for two months. He returned to win a playoff start and pitched well in the ORGANIZATION League.One of the biggest keys to ORGANIZATION's progression has been him gaining an understanding of what he needed to do to handle a full-season workload as a starting pitcher. With a throwing and running program that truly works for him, the former first-round pick has seen his fastball velocity increase every year. In 2015, his heater averaged over 93 mph and he touched as high as 97 mph with hard sink and late life. His slider is his best secondary offering and effectively misses bats. He continues to show more confidence in his changeup as well. He's generally around the strike zone and really likes to compete on the mound.Thanks to buying into his routine, ORGANIZATION profiles as a middle of the rotation starter, a workhorse who should be able to eat up a lot of valuable innings in the future, though he did make two trips to the disabled list in 2016",0
"The biggest thing holding ORGANIZATION back so far has been health. If he can stay on the field, he has the chance to contribute.ORGANIZATION turned out to be the ORGANIZATION' top signee in 2012 when PERSON didn't sign. A variety of leg issues allowed him to amass only 84 games in just over a year of pro ball. ORGANIZATION does have solid tools across the board. He has the chance to hit, with some power, from the right side of the plate. ORGANIZATION has the speed to steal a base and potentially stay in center field, though some think left field might be his eventual home.Before figuring that out, ORGANIZATION needs to get a full season of at-bats in. If it can all come together, he has the potential to at the very least be a valuable fourth outfielder type.",0
"A high-profile recruit at GPE, PERSON missed his entire first season with the ORGANIZATION because of a wrist injury in 2014. He never really got going at the plate until the end of his college career, though he did earn ORGANIZATION honors in the GPE ORGANIZATION in the summer of 2016. He continued to perform well with wood bats after signing for $162,800 as an eighth-rounder in 2017, leading the short-season LOCATION with 118 total bases in his pro debut and hitting for power in low Class A this year.Despite hitting .257/.360/.398 in three years with GPE, PERSON possesses more raw power than the typical middle infielder. He may strike out too much to ever hit for a high average, but he could deliver 15 homers per season from the left side of the plate. He'll flash above-average speed but it plays more as average on the bases.Erratic at third base and shortstop earlier in his college career, PERSON committed just two miscues in 60 games at second base as a redshirt junior. He has the solid arm strength and enough range to play on the left side of the infield, enhancing his utility value if he can't make it as a regular.",0
"The best pitching prospect out of GPE and the top hurler overall in this year's class, PERSON is smart and fearless on the mound. Evaluators believe he can be a top-of-the-rotation type of pitcher if he stays healthy and continues to develop his tools at a normal pace. He projects to have average or above-average tools across the board and he's already considered advanced for his age.The teenager's best pitch is his fastball, but he also projects to feature a good curveball and an above-average changeup. He already shows good command and feel for his pitches and the mix results in a lot of swing-and-misses. PERSON is still growing, and the hope is that he will increase the velocity and overall command of his fastball with age. Back in February, PERSON mixed all of his pitches to strike out five of the six batters he faced at the ORGANIZATION in GPE, GPE. He did walk a batter, but more importantly, he showed a plus fastball and emerging secondary pitches.PERSON is from PERSON, GPE, and trains with PERSON. The Cubs are the favorite to sign him.",0
"Having developed several pitchers drafted as high schoolers, the Pirates know that patience is of the utmost importance. So there was no panic when PERSON, who was given an over-pick value deal to sign in 2014 instead of head to GPE, started his career slowly. He didn't pitch much in 2015 because of injuries, most notably a forearm strain, but he made a huge leap forward during a healthy 2016, finishing the year with some stellar playoff starts and helping PERSON win the ORGANIZATION State League title.PERSON's fastball keeps on getting better, now sitting in the low-to-mid-90s, with the ability to reach back for more. There's a ton of sink to it and that, along with his improved changeup, elicits ground-ball outs. His 11-to-5 curve is his best secondary pitch, and he misses plenty of bats with that and his heater. PERSON beyond his years, PERSON has vastly improved his ability to harness his stuff and fill the strike zone with all of his pitches.PERSON had to deal with another injury, this time a back strain, in 2017, but is still very much poised to join the group of elite-level pitching prospects in the game. Still very much projectable, he now looks like he could be a frontline starter if he reaches his ceiling.",1
"GPE spent 2018 in the ORGANIZATION and should come stateside in 2019. Short but good-framed, he has plus hands, good infield footwork, and will probably grow into enough arm for the left side of the infield. His swing is a little long right now but he's athletic, wings harder than is typical for a teenager this size, and has plenty of time for mechanical tweaks. He's an interesting, long-term shortstop prospect.",0
"PERSON was shelved with a back injury during the summer of 2016 but was healthy and turned loose on the ORGANIZATION in 2017. He has good feel to hit and plus raw power projection (though he'll likely need to refine his approah to get to all of that power) with a non-zero chance of staying in center field. PERSON's frame suggests added mass as he ages, which might move him to right field, but he''ll probably have the bat to play there, too.",0
"Heading into the 2015 Draft, many felt PERSON was a late first-rounder or even a second-round candidate. That included PERSON himself, who was pleasantly surprised when the ORGANIZATION swooped in with the 22nd overall pick to take him. PERSON gave him full pick value of just over $2.1 million to sign him away from PERSON A&M.The ORGANIZATION love big arms and this PERSON high school standout definitely has that, with a plus fastball that sits consistently in the 94-95 mph range. He's almost all power all the time, including his hard breaking curve, which is a plus pitch at times for him. Like with many high schoolers, he didn't need a changeup much during his amateur days, but he's shown some feel for it and it should be at least PERSON average in time. His size -- his 6-foot-2 listing has been described as generous -- and his delivery have some feeling he could end up in a bullpen, but he has all the ingredients to succeed as a starter.PERSON has already impressed with his competitive nature on the mound. The ORGANIZATION are excited to see how he makes adjustments and finds consistency as his pro career begins in earnest.",0
"PERSON agreed to a $6.5 million bonus with the ORGANIZATION as the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall GPE pick in 2014 only to have the club cut the offer to $5 million after a post-GPE physical raised concerns about his left elbow. He chose not to accept the reduced bonus, becoming just the third ORGANIZATION. 1 pick in GPE history not to sign, and enlisted to pitch for ORGANIZATION's (PERSON, Fla.) post-graduate program in 2015. Unfortunately, PERSON's concerns about PERSON's elbow were validated when he left his first outing with ORGANIZATION after just 13 pitches and underwent PERSON surgery days later. The ORGANIZATION were happy to gamble on PERSON's upside in the GPE, selecting him 17th overall and then signing him for $2,513,280.During his storied amateur career, PERSON showed command of three legitimate plus pitches. The left-hander spots his fastball to both sides of the plate, working at 92-94 mph and touching 97 with late life, and he can throw his curveball for a strike or take it out of the zone to induce whiffs. PERSON's changeup gives him a third weapon, thrown with good deception and tumble, and his athleticism and smooth, repeatable delivery bode well for his command profile.After beginning 2016 in extended spring training, PERSON made his long awaited pro debut in late June for the ORGANIZATION' PERSON affiliate. If he can regain and then build on his pre-surgery form, PERSON could develop into a front-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"Signed by the ORGANIZATION out of the ORGANIZATION for $75,000 in 2009, PERSON began reaching triple digits with his fastball when he made his GPE debut in 2012. Since then, though, he has been involved in three trades in the last three years, first going to the FACILITY in the ORGANIZATION Peavy/Jose Iglesias deal in July 2013, then to GPE in the swap that sent PERSON from the ORGANIZATION to GPE in December, and, finally, to the A's as part of the ORGANIZATION Reddick-Rich Hill deal that transpired on the Aug. 1 Trade Deadline in '16. One of the hardest-throwing starters in the game, PERSON maintains mid-90s heat into the late innings and can reach back for 102 mph. His fastball has some sinking and cutting action but also can straighten out when he overthrows it. His mid-80s slider also can overpower hitters, though it too flattens out at times.While PERSON has improved his delivery and control since signing, he still remains more thrower than pitcher and scouts are split on whether he'd be better off as a starter or reliever. He lacks consistency with a third pitch, as his changeup will exhibit good fade some outings and be nothing more than a batting-practice fastball on others. His weight, listed at 255 pounds, also is a concern.",1
"The ORGANIZATION liked PERSON's bat so much, they gave him seven figures to sign in 2012 and then let him make his pro debut stateside, in the ORGANIZATION in 2013. He repeated the ORGANIZATION again in 2014, with much better results, and finally left the complex circuit in 2015, where he struggled to match those results in the GPE. PERSON is the real tool for PERSON, and he has plenty of raw potential in that area. Just 19, he has the chance to be a good all-around hitter, but he's extremely raw in terms of his approach, though the switch-hitter does have tremendous bat speed. Originally a shortstop when he signed, he moved to third base in 2013. That's not going to work because of a shoulder injury and surgery, and his arm hasn't come all the way back. He played both left field and first in 2014, focusing soley on the infield in 2015. He's not overly athletic, and there is concern that he won't be able to move around enough to man an outfield corner. PERSON will be key in letting PERSON develop. Regardless of his position, it will be his bat that will allow him to advance.",0
"PERSON's crafty application of pretty average stuff enabled him to strike out a batter per inning at ORGANIZATION Beach last season, albeit as a prospect of relativley advanced age. He can manipulate the shape of his fastball -- which can cut, sink or ride -- which, in PERSON's best starts, he had pinpoint control of. Both of his secondaries are viable big league offerings when they're located, but PERSON gets in trouble, especially with his changeup, when he misses within the strike zone. He has fifth starter traits. Double-A will be an excellent stress test for PERSON's command, which needs to max out if he's to fit on a big league staff.",0
"PERSON didn't start pitching full time until he hit the junior college ranks, then he spent two seasons as PERSON's closer. His fastball will sit in the 92-93 mph range with deception, and he combines it with a good hard curve. He throws both pitches for strikes and goes right after hitters. He's been closing games in the ORGANIZATION system since he entered it in the summer of 2012 and has racked up saves and strikeouts while issuing very few walks. His stuff may be a bit short to close at the big league level, but he's looking like the type of reliever who could move quickly and help a big league bullpen out in the seventh or eighth inning.",0
Low-90s lefty with a good slider. PERSON frame.,0
"The ORGANIZATION of GPE ace makes you take notice with a quick, loose arm and a plus fastball -- one that has touched 98 mph. But he's more than just fastball velocity. He throws both a curve ball and a changeup, and while they're not as consistent as his fastball, both should be at least PERSON average in the future.Shipley is generally around the plate with all three pitches and isn't afraid to go right after hitters.He might not be a part of the elite group of college arms in the class, but he isn't far behind, and a very strong junior year had him moving up ORGANIZATION boards everywhere.",1
"PERSON ORGANIZATION and PERSON represented the ORGANIZATION high school ranks in the first round of the Draft in 2011. In 2012, it was PERSON's turn. PERSON and durable, he has a fastball that can be above-average, touching 94 mph when he needs to reach back for a little extra. His hard curve has good downer rotation at times, but it becomes slurvy when he drops his arm angle. PERSON didn't need a changeup much in high school, so it's behind the other two, but it should be a usable third pitch. He's aggressive on the mound and tends to be around the strike zone, with his command sure to improve as he refines his mechanics.",0
"The stringy PERSON has arguably the most copious physical projection in the class and some scouts think his frame has room to add about 30 pounds while still retaining the range and flexibility for shortstop. PERSON's endless limbs spear down and corral ground balls and he has shocking body control for an athlete his age with his build. PERSON isn't strong with the bat just yet but his swing has some natural loft from both sides of the plate and if his body matures in the ORGANIZATION Zone that allows him to stay at short and do damage with the stick, he could be a star.",0
"PERSON GPE and PERSON were the marquee names among GPE high school pitchers entering the year, but PERSON joined them on the ORGANIZATION USA pitching staff that won a gold medal at the 18-and-under World Cup last September and has surpassed them both this spring. He outclassed GPE and even homered off him in a state 4-A playoff game in May, cementing his place in the first round. He has the best chance of the trio of developing three solid pitches.PERSON's fastball already sits at 92-95 mph and reaches 98 with heavy sink and the promise of more velocity once he fills out his athletic 6-foot-5 frame. His 82-87 mph changeup is equally effective, featuring fading action and often bottoming out at the plate. He'll also unleash a plus slider at 82-85 mph, though it's not quite as consistent as his other two offerings.PERSON repeats his mechanics well and has advanced feel for pitching. His delivery and arm action aren't as smooth as those of GPE and GPE, but his stuff is so good he has won over teams leery of taking high school pitchers in the first round. If he follows through on his commitment to GPE, he'll be Draft-eligible as a sophomore in 2020.",0
"PERSON's first full season of pro ball after being taken from the high school ranks in GPE in 2013 was truncated considerably when the outfielder struck out and punched a wall, breaking his hand. He was out from mid-May until the end of July, but still managed to show why he's one of the better hitters in the system.In some ways, PERSON has an advanced approach at the plate, especially for a young player from GPE, where they don't have the opportunity to play as much as in some warmer climates. He has a simple, level swing with good bat speed. He knows the strike zone, but he also can get a little pull-happy. Once he can find the balance between his hittability and power, he has the chance to hit for average and with considerable pop. A former high school catcher, PERSON has a solid arm and is actually fairly athletic, though he's a fringy defender and likely limited to left field.That might be OK, since it's really PERSON's bat that will move him up the ladder. Right-handed run-producing bats aren't always easy to find, but PERSON could develop into just that in the future.",1
"PERSON began his incredible run in 2013 by winning the ORGANIZATION at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, and he ended it by winning the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION. In between, the ORGANIZATION made him the ORGANIZATION. 2 overall pick, and he crushed pitching everywhere he went. That continued as PERSON battled for the 2014 Minor League home run lead all season long.PERSON has well-above-average power, and he drives the ball to all fields. There is some swing-and-miss in his game, but he has worked to eliminate some of the holes in his swing, and he projects to be able to hit for a good average.PERSON has a strong arm, and he's more athletic than his large frame would suggest. He should be able to stay at third base, but he played some outfield in college, and he'd be able to handle a move to right field if necessary. PERSON wowed in his professional debut, and GPE likely won't have to wait long for him to get to GPE.",1
"PERSON was a Spring Training sensation for the ORGANIZATION in 2011 and appeared on the verge of reaching ORGANIZATION. But he never did reach the GPE, as he missed most of 2012 and all of '13 following PERSON surgery. After he returned to the mound in '14, the ORGANIZATION traded him to the ORGANIZATION during the offseason. Before he got hurt, PERSON showed the potential for three plus pitches. His velocity returned in 2014, as his fastball again consistently reached 94 mph. He also got swings and misses with his curveball and changeup, and also has begun to mix in a slider. While PERSON bounced back well in 2014, he still needs to prove he can throw enough strikes to realize his ceiling as a starter. If he can do so, he could quickly reach the Major Leagues with his new club.",1
"Woods-Richardson broke out on the showcase circuit last summer, running his fastball up to 95 mph at the ORGANIZATION Games and showing three-pitch potential at multiple events. He looked like a potential top-three-rounds pick, but hasn't built on that momentum this spring. Pro teams are still interested, though now they're wondering if he might be destined to become a reliever and if he can be picked early enough to sign him away from a GPE commitment.Though Woods-Richardson's arm speed and athleticism still endear him to scouts, he has spent much of his senior year pitching at 89-92 mph with a fastball that features more angle than life. A midseason tonsillectomy didn't help, but he also has a history of inconsistency with his stuff. His curveball hasn't been as sharp as hoped either, and he hasn't used his changeup much after it looked promising last summer.Woods-Richardson has a sound delivery with a high-three-quarters arm slot and repeats it well. But unless he shows he can carry his best stuff deeper into ballgames, he may wind up in the bullpen. He's also a talented third baseman with power and arm strength, giving him a chance to contribute as a two-way player if he joins the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON is going to strike out but he has above-average pull power that he's learning to tap into in games, runs well, and should be fine at third. He has a plus arm (accuracy is sometimes an issue) and is comfortable charging slow rollers on the grass, but, generally, he is not especially polished there. PERSON hasn't played third base full-time for all that long and he should be average there at peak. He profiles as an average regular and should get plenty of playing time in 2018.",1
"Some scouts believe that only PERSON has more raw power than PERSON in this year's class. That same group also says PERSON might be a better overall hitter than Garcia.This is what we know: PERSON can appear out of control at times, and he's a max-effort prospect, but he hits balls hard and can hit home runs. The shortstop starred in the multiple prospect leagues in the GPE, and he built a reputation as a quiet but focused teenager with a big body and a strong desire to win.Like many his age, PERSON sometimes struggles with breaking balls and offspeed pitches, but his pitch recognition should improve with experience. He crushes fastballs and has noteworthy pull power. PERSON is a shortstop now, but he could end up at third base or right field because of his future arm and decent hands. PERSON is based out of GPE, GPE, and is trained by PERSON. The ORGANIZATION are the front-runner to sign the teenager.",0
"PERSON performed in Double-A and Triple-A in 2018 and was added to the 40-man this winter. He may have the raw stuff to start but his frame and stamina leave something to be desired, so he fits best in 1-2 inning stints. His fastball and slider are both above average, with the slider flashing plus at times, and his command has improved to be close to average, so there's plenty here for a left-handed middle reliever. Plus, he's big league ready.",1
"PERSON's stock rose all spring as he helped PERSON (Fla.) to a Class 3A state championship. Not long after he won the state title, PERSON selected him in the third round of the 2014 Draft.PERSON impressed scouts with his natural hitting ability. He has an easy and loose swing, and he uses his quick hands and strength to drive the ball. PERSON squares the ball up well, and he hits plenty of line drives. He has solid power, but he is at his best when he is driving balls into the gaps and not looking for home runs.PERSON is an average runner, which may eventually force him to move to an outfield corner. His athleticism and improving feel for the game help his tools play up, and they give him a chance to stay in center field. His development will be slowed by a 50-game suspension for a positive amphetamine test that will start when the 2015 short-season PERSON commences.",0
"Another bargain international signing for the GPE, PERSON turned pro for $45,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2011. More of a thrower in his first three pro seasons, he has added more polish in 2015 and led scouts to believe he has a chance to make it as a starter.PERSON has made significant strides maintaining his arm slot and repeating his delivery, which has resulted in improved stuff. He's working at 92-95 mph and has touched 97 mph with his fastball. He has refined what had been a slurvy breaking ball into more of a true slider, and his changeup has been more reliable than ever.PERSON' control is still a work in progress, though he's filling the strike zone more than he did in his first season in low Class A. If he can't cut it in the rotation, he could become a late-inning reliever with an upper-90s fastball.",0
"An everyday player at multiple infield positions for Michigan the last three years, GPE set a school record with 12 saves as a sophomore in 2014 and has shuttled between the bullpen and rotation this spring. The burden of double duty and changing mound roles caused his stuff to fade down the stretch, but scouts would love to see what he can do when he focuses solely on pitching in pro ball.GPE has the best splitter in the GPE, and 83-86 mph offering that tumbles at the plate and elicits consistent swings and misses. He uses it too much, to the detriment of his fastball command. His heater ranges from 88-94 mph with some run and sink, and he also has an inconsistent slider.GPE figures to get an opportunity to start as a pro but likely will be a reliever. He lacks size, has a so-so delivery and had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his shoulder following his freshman year. Part of the ORGANIZATION's national team identification program in high school, he's a good athlete and a tough competitor.",0
"The ORGANIZATION were a fun team to check out in 2015 because of the presence of PERSON and PERSON on the staff. PERSON might have more polish, but PERSON's arm strength gives plenty to be excited about.Based on pure velocity, PERSON has a top of the scale fastball, one that hits 99-101 mph and sits consistently north of 95 mph. A lack of movement and below-average command keep it from being an 80 on the scouting scale. The rest of his stuff is raw. His changeup is a bit more consistent than his breaking pitches and he will show an above-average offspeed pitch from time to time. PERSON is working on both a curve and slider, with the former ahead of the latter, an 11-to-5 breaker with good rotation and depth at times. He started to show the ability to throw strikes more consistently with his secondary pitches during his jump to full-season ball in 2016.With room to fill out and get stronger, PERSON could start repeating his delivery more effectively as he matures. He has a long way to go, but a triple-digit fastball is always a good place to start.",1
"PERSON led the Big East Conference in strikeouts as a Xavier sophomore and then continued to raise his profile in the ORGANIZATION, which he led in strikeouts (54), whiffs per nine innings (13.6) and K/BB ratio (13.5). As a junior, he established a school record for strikeouts (123) while finishing fourth in ORGANIZATION Division I in whiff rate (13.3). Targeting PERSON's bat-missing ability, the ORGANIZATION took him with the ORGANIZATION. 74 overall pick in the second competitive balance round, and he continued his run of dominance by posting a 1.66 ERA with 12.4 K/9 during his pro debut with PERSON. A move up to full-season ball in '18 brought even more success for PERSON, as he received a promotion to PERSON Advanced Frederick after six dominant starts with PERSON Delmarva.PERSON's best pitch is a fastball that sits at 87-90 mph and tops out at 93. It plays well above its fringy velocity, as he commands it well and creates deception by hiding the ball well before generating massive extension to the plate. He's unlikely to throw much harder because he's already physically mature at 6-foot-2 and 235 pounds.PERSON's ability to pitch off of his fastball increases the effectiveness of his above-average curveball and a changeup that ranges from fringy to average. His control is average, with room for improvement, though he does offset many of his free passes with strikeouts. While the effectiveness of his modest arsenal will be tested at higher levels, PERSON's pitchability and knack for missing bats points to a career as a ORGANIZATION. 4 starter.",0
"The ORGANIZATION spent a Draft-record $17,865,000 on bonuses in 2015, including $900,000 for PERSON in the 11th round. He might have gone in the top five rounds if not for questions about his signability, which persisted even after he switched his college commitment from GPE to LOCATION California.PERSON's best pitch is his curveball, a plus downer when he stays on top of it. He usually pitches at 88-90 mph and tops out at 92 with his fastball, which could add a bit more velocity in the future and features nice run and sink. He also shows good feel and deception with his changeup.While his athleticism should help him repeat his delivery, PERSON has a long arm action and struggles to keep everything in sync. He doesn't have a true out pitch, so he'll need to be finer with his control and command as he progresses through the Minors.",1
"Built like a muscle car, PERSON has electric bat speed and exciting pull-side power for a player his age. PERSON very muscular and strong, he needs to develop on defense (some scouts wanted to see him catch rather than see if he could become a viable infielder, and his hands aren't great) and probably needs a swing overhaul (both the bat path and lower half usage were pretty rough in high school), but there's a chance he's a power-hitting up-the-middle player of some kind.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have accumulated several pitching prospects with advanced command and control in recent years, and the star of that class was PERSON, who led all Minor Leaguers with an 8.1 K/BB ratio in 2013. While his K/BB ratio wasn't quite so otherworldly in 2014, he held his own in the hitter friendly GPE. After the season, he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION as a part of the ORGANIZATION McGehee trade. PERSON showed more consistent fastball velocity in 2014, working at 90-93 mph and regularly reaching 95 mph. He mixes his heater well with his changeup, which makes him tough on left-handed hitters. PERSON also throws a curveball and a cutter, both of which can be solid at times. PERSON may not have a true plus pitch, but his command helps his stuff play up. He doesn't have a ton of physical projection remaining, so his ceiling likely tops out as a No. 4 starter.",1
"If everything clicks for this young GPE lefty, PERSON has the chance to be something special, even if PERSON seems a long way off.PERSON has everything you want from a southpaw. He has a fastball that reaches up to 93-94 mph, and he has a good curveball to go along with it. PERSON also throws a slider, which isn't as good as his other breaking ball, and he shows a really good feel for a changeup. The one thing of concern is that PERSON put on a lot of weight, and it is not the good kind. It's clear he's going to have to work hard on his conditioning to continue his progress.PERSON is only 17 years old. If he can get in shape, he has the stuff to be a top-flight left-handed pitching prospect.",1
"PERSON PERSON built on his momentum from the ORGANIZATION, where he displayed one of the best left-handed swings while hitting .329 last summer, he might have gone in the top three rounds of the 2015. It hasn't quite worked out that way because he failed to drive the ball consistently while dealing with oblique and knee injuries.With his compact stroke and plate discipline, PERSON should continue to hit for average. But through the end of the regular season, he had homered just seven times in three college seasons. He has the bat speed and strength for 15-18 homer power in pro ball, though he's going to have to get more aggressive and turn on and lift more pitches to get there.PERSON opened this year as PERSON's shortstop before his injuries pushed him to third base, which would be a better fit as a pro. He lacks the quickness for shortstop and may not be more than an adequate defender at third base, though he does have a very strong arm. If he doesn't produce more pop he may be relegated to a utility role, though some scouts are intrigued by the possibility of turning him into a catcher.",0
"His days as a third baseman officially over, PERSON now hopes he can get to the big leagues as a corner outfielder. He still has the bat to profile there, but he'll have to prove his production can match his potential. PERSON mixed in 15 games at the hot corner in the ORGANIZATION State League in 2014, but he has put his infielder's glove away for good. His defense in the outfield continues to be a work in progress, as the below-average runner isn't the most athletic player out there, though he does have a solid arm. Offensively, PERSON has made some strides, cutting down on his strikeouts while continuing to show good plate discipline and draw walks. He's shown a penchant for hitting well late in games, a sign he likes to be up there in big situations. PERSON has enough bat to be an everyday corner outfielder at the big league level. Now all he has to do is go out and play like it.",0
"Drafted in the 20th round in 2012 by the ORGANIZATION as a catcher, PERSON was a full-time hitter as an GPE freshman before becoming a two-way player as a sophomore and solely a pitcher as a junior. He excited scouts by running his fastball up to 96 mph and showing a hard slider at the 2014 Big Ten Conference tournament and in the ORGANIZATION, but he hasn't been as sharp this spring.PERSON has a big league body at 6-foot-5 and 220 pounds and shows flashes of becoming a power pitcher. He's still reaching the mid-90s with his fastball, but he's not maintaining his velocity deep into games. He's dipping as low as 87 mph and usually pitching around 90-93 with minimal life.PERSON's breaking ball hasn't been as sharp in 2015 and now resembles more of a curveball. He does show some feel for a sinking changeup but has a lot of work to do with his command. While he's understandably raw as a pitcher, he also has left scouts wishing he had made more progress this year.",0
"PERSON turned in one of the better under-the-radar performances among college hurlers in 2017 as a GPE junior by posting a 2.86 ERA over a 100 2/3 innings, with 138 strikeouts and a strikeouts-per-nine rate of 12.34 that placed him in the top 10 nationally in both categories. However, PERSON's profile as an undersized righty with below-average velocity hurt his GPE stock, ultimately leading to his selection by GPE in the eighth round. Spending his entire pro debut with PERSON, PERSON piled up 58 strikeouts (14.9 K/9) and allowed just four earned runs over 35 innings en route to a 1.03 ERA, the third-best mark in the circuit for hurlers with at least 35 IP. PERSON makes a living by pairing his well-commanded fastball with a well-above-average changeup that scouts viewed as one of the best in his GPE class. Though his heater usually hovers around 90 mph, at times touching a few ticks higher, PERSON has enough velocity to effectively set up hitters for his fading changeup, which he throws with fastball-like arm action, and a slider that shows average potential. Nothing he throws is overpowering, but he has distinct feel for locating his entire arsenal. As an undersized right-hander with a pitchability-over-stuff profile, PERSON faces an uphill path toward becoming a big league starter.",0
"Being the son of the greatest closer in the history of the game can be tough for a pitcher trying to find his way. After two pedestrian seasons at ORGANIZATION, there may not have been thoughts of following in dad's footsteps. But a breakout junior campaign has put PERSON Jr. firmly on the radar.PERSON has seen a big jump in his velocity, cranking his fastball up to 97 mph this spring. He sat in the 92-95 mph range more often than not. His slider shows glimpses of being at least above-average and could sharpen with more time and experience. He's shown a splitter in the bullpens, but a lack of feel for the offspeed pitch has kept him from using it in games. He's generally around the strike zone, though his overall command suffers as games go on.PERSON's size and slight build lead to the inevitable concerns about durability. His power stuff, not to mention his pedigree, point to a future as a reliever in the pro ranks.",0
"As the son of former ORGANIZATION, it only makes sense that PERSON was one of the top overall prospects available during the 2015 international signing period. The ORGANIZATION traded a pair of prospects in exchange for international bonus pool money, and it ultimately allowed the club to give PERSON a $3.9 million bonus, the second highest in franchise history. Despite the lack of professional experience, it can be argued that PERSON's offensive ceiling is higher than any player in the system, and he's showcased some of the offensive potential this year during his pro debut for Rookie-level Bluefield. Much like his father, PERSON has an explosive right-handed swing and can put the barrel on almost any pitch he swings at. His combination of bat speed and physical strength produces effortless raw power, and his hand-eye coordination and barrel control should allow him to get to it in games consistently. PERSON is thicker and less athletic than his father at the same age. He was expected to play left field after signing, but the ORGANIZATION worked him out at third base during instructional league and he's passed most tests at the position thus far. However, he's also a well below-average runner who lacks the range and arm strength for the position, and some scouts believe he'll have to move to first base in the future. Regardless of his future defensive home, it will be PERSON's promising bat that carries him to the ORGANIZATION.",1
"PERSON was the third GPE high school outfielder drafted in the first round in 2013. He doesn't profile as a five-tool player like fellow Peach State natives PERSON and PERSON. Instead, PERSON's speed and athleticism make him a potential top-of-the-order catalyst.PERSON's best tool is his plus speed, which makes him a threat to steal and allows him to cover ground well in center field. He also earns praise for his understanding of the game, helping his speed to play up on both sides of the ball.PERSON has an easy and smooth stroke, and he has a knack for putting the bat on the ball. His swing is geared to hitting line drives into the gaps, limiting his power potential.",0
"When you're a big shortstop initially from the GPE PERSON, there are going to be the inevitable comparisons to the ORGANIZATION' PERSON, who was the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in 2012 out of the ORGANIZATION. PERSON, who moved to PERSON in GPE for his senior year, isn't on GPE's level, but does bring a lot to the table.PERSON performed well on the summer showcase circuit, at ORGANIZATION and the LOCATION Pro Showcase, capping things off by playing in GPE's All-American Classic. Over the summer, he displayed excellent bat speed and some offensive upside. He's been inconsistent this spring, starting off particularly slowly. PERSON physically mature, PERSON does have some power to tap into. That could be important because unlike GPE, most believe PERSON won't be able to stay at shortstop. A move to third base could be in order, where his defensive actions could make him an above-average defender at the hot corner.A team taking PERSON early could very well send him out as a shortstop to see what happens, but that team will also hope the bat they saw more consistently over the summer is the one that will allow him to profile well at an infield corner spot.",0
"PERSON began his college career at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, but found himself stuck behind three infielders who could all go in the top five rounds in this year's Draft. So after his freshman season with the ORGANIZATION in 2018, he transferred to GPE Junior College in GPE. The move has paid off as the infielder has put up big numbers and moved himself into top-five-round consideration this June.The switch-hitter has shown the ability to hit for average and power in junior college and it's his bat that will carry him. He has easy power from the left side of the plate and has a good right-handed swing as well, with more gap power from that side. A shortstop in high school, PERSON moved to second base at GPE because they had a superior defender there and, to his credit, he was willing to do whatever was needed to make the team better. He has decent hands and a solid arm and he could get the chance to move back to shortstop after being drafted, though his somewhat limited range might make second the best spot for him long-term.A loaded GPE squad had five players taken in the top 10 rounds in the 2017 Draft. This year's roster isn't as loaded, but PERSON, with a floor of an offensive-minded utility player and a ceiling as a bat-first regular at second base, should join that crop in hearing his name called at some point on Day 2.",0
"The ORGANIZATION lauded ORGANIZATION's glove after acquiring him, going so far as to say that they think he could handle shortstop if they needed him to. At least in our longest stretch of in-person evaluation of ORGANIZATION, he has looked just okay at third base, and saw time at first. 
The bat-to-ball skills are real. He's a career .286 hitter in the minors and has reached base at a .346 clip. A lack of game power probably means ORGANIZATION fits better in a multi-positional reserve role than as a regular at third or first base. He appears athletic enough to handle the corner outfield spots, and it makes sense to give him time there in the near future.",0
"PERSON PERSON set an Illinois record with 14 saves in 2015, when the PERSON made him the ORGANIZATION. 6 overall choice in the GPE. This spring, GPE matched PERSON by the end of the regular season and also climbed to within two of his GPE career mark of 24 saves. He won't go as high in the GPE, but he should be one of the first college relievers selected and fit in the first four or five rounds.A pure reliever who has never started a game in three years of college or during summer ball, GPE attacks hitters with two pitches. He has sat at 92-96 mph with his fastball throughout the spring, even when working on consecutive days. His sharp 82-85 mph slider can be a plus pitch at times and is especially tough on right-handers.GPE has a lot of flying parts in his funky delivery, which provides deception but also hampers his command at times. How well he can locate his pitches ultimately will determine if he reaches his ceiling as a set-up man. His strong 6-foot-4 frame and resilient arm make him a durable bullpen option and he should be one of the first 2018 GPEees to reach the big leagues.",0
"PERSON began his professional career with the Mariners in 2015, but was gone via a trade to the Padres that offseason before he even hit full-season ball. He reached Double-A with PERSON in 2017 and the ORGANIZATION acquired him in the ORGANIZATION trade that offseason. The right-hander was a consistent member of the Triple-A rotation, making his big league debut last July.PERSON has two pitches, his fastball and changeup, that are ready to get big league hitters out. He'll throw his fastball typically in the 92-95 mph range and will sit at 93-94 with comfort, showing the ability to reach back for a bit more at times. He'll miss bats and get groundball outs with it when he's at his best. His changeup is his best secondary pitch, one that flashes plus and has good fade to it. His breaking ball remains behind his other two offerings. On a good day, he'll show an average pitch, but it's often slurvy and some see it as more of a slider than a curveball.Just 23 for all of the 2019 season, PERSON has shown he has the durability to remain in a rotation and the ORGANIZATION aren't ready to give up on him as a starter just yet. His future might be depending on tightening up and consistently throwing his breaking ball, knowing that his fastball-changeup combination could play up in shorter stints out of the bullpen.",1
" PERSON burst on the scene in 2011 when he hit .354 in two short-season stops. Despite missing time with a concussion that forced him out of the ORGANIZATION in 2012, he showed that his previous season was no mirage. He reached Double-A, even homering in the playoffs, while topping the organization in batting average and slugging percentage while finishing second in on-base percentage and third in GPE. A former infielder, PERSON made a smooth transition to right field and should profile well there, though perhaps without the plus power some like to see from the position. Still, he has a very good approach at the plate and a quick swing that should allow him to continue to hit for average. Heâs a good baserunner with average speed, and has the arm and range to be a good defensive outfielder. Itâs not often 13th-round picks turn into big league regulars, but this one has a chance to do just that.",0
"  GSP's conditioning and future position had some concerned about the GPE prepster as he entered his senior year of high school. But GSP shed weight, improved his overall conditioning and had a fantastic season to move into the top half of the first round. Then he went out and had as good, if not the best, of any debut by a 2012 draftee, finishing his summer in the full-season ORGANIZATION. GSP displayed outstanding bat speed and he should have above-average power in the future. He should become an even better all-around hitter as he learns to adjust to offspeed stuff. He's an average runner, maybe a tick above, but he's aggressive on the basepaths and should continue to steal some bases. It was initially assumed that GSP would have to move to third as a pro, and his bat would profile just fine there, but he's convinced many he can stay at shortstop with good hands, a well above-average arm and solid range. With his stunning debut, GSP could move more quickly than many high school hitters.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"PERSON is a projectable GPE high school pitcher. He started pitching late in his high school career but quickly excelled on the mound. Listed at 6-foot-2, 165 pounds, scouts see plenty of room for PERSON to physically mature. That, combined with his athleticism and easy arm action, lead them to believe PERSON will be able to add velocity to his fastball. PERSON, PERSON's fastball sits in the upper 80s and regularly touches the low 90s. He also throws a tight curveball and has some feel for a changeup.",0
"Perhaps the draft's most fascinating prospect, PERSON laid waste to the ORGANIZATION this year, hitting .400/.500/.840 this season. This after he was a 38th rounder last year. He has made adjustments and is getting to his plus raw power more consistently but R/R college first baseman have a poor draf track record and, while superlative, PERSON's track record of hitting at this level is short.",0
"We've learned a lot about PERSON's stuff based on the data we have from his 2017 relief-only cup of coffee with PERSON and from his larger, eight-start September 2018 carafe with PERSON. The PERSON gave PERSON his curveball back after it appeared that PERSON had shelved it late last year, but there's now release point data supporting the anecdotal evidence that the right-hander raises his arm slot when he throws it. It's also clear that despite high-end velocity, PERSON's fastball isn't going to miss that many bats. He's created greater demarcation in the movement between his four and two-seamers, that latter of which pairs well with his improving changeup, which now projects to be PERSON's best secondary pitch. There's a strong chance he either ends up in relief due to issues with his fastball efficacy stemming from limited command and movement, but even if that's the case, he's a four-pitch reliever with two plus offerings, and that probably plays at the back of a bullpen.",1
"PERSON pitched to a 1.37 ERA over 21 appearances out of GPE's bullpen as a true freshman and was off to a strong start in 2016 before undergoing PERSON surgery. After making a healthy return and turning another strong relief campaign as a redshirt sophomore, PERSON was moved into the ORGANIZATION' rotation in 2018 and excelled in the new role, going 7-3 with a 2.19 ERA in 16 starts en route to GPE Athletic Conference pitcher of the year honors. The ORGANIZATION took him in the 14th round that June and used him as a swingman in his pro debut before shifting PERSON back to a full-time bullpen role for his first full season. It proved a wise decision, as he quickly climbed three levels, reaching the Double-A ORGANIZATION in mid-July before he was sent to the ORGANIZATION in return for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION Deadline.PERSON is capable of bumping 94-95 mph with his fastball but usually sits more in the low-90s, with the pitch playing on account of some funk in his delivery and because he hides the ball well on the backside. His slider is his lone above-average secondary pitch and makes him lethal on same-sided hitters, but he also has a good changeup that he uses to neutralize righties. He can throw strikes and miss bats with all three pitches, and hitters generally have trouble squaring him up. PERSON has been particularly effective against left-handed hitters early in his career thanks to his combination of stuff and deception, but he also shown that he can get outs on both sides of the plate while consistently inducing weak contact. Those traits suggest that he could be more than simply a situational left-hander out of the 'pen, although a ORGANIZATION role likely represents his clearest path to the ORGANIZATION.",0
"GPE drew wide-ranging takes from scouts in the year leading up to signing with the ORGANIZATION as an 11th rounder from an Ohio high school. He played on the ORGANIZATION, the top travel team in the country, and was scouted often, with a decent but not great glove at third base, above average to plus power, and some feel for hitting and game power, but seemed a mid-round prospect. In the spring and into pro ball, GPE slimmed up a bit and now projects as at least average at third base, with similar raw power, but some pro scouts questioned his feel to hit. All the elements have been there at some point over the past year and some amateur scouts were really in on GPE -- one said he saw a lot of PERSON in him -- but didn't realize his price would end up being as low as it was once he started sliding in the draft.",0
" When the ORGANIZATION signed PERSON out of GPE in 2011, scouts liked the 16-year-old's size and power potential. But he went homerless in his first three professional seasons, while his natural hitting ability proved to be better than advertised. He'll try to unlock his power with a new organization, as the D-backs acquired him in April in exchange for a competitive balance PERSON pick. PERSON has a good understanding of the strike zone and solid on-base skills, and he makes a lot of contact. His projectable frame and good bat speed give scouts optimism that he will add more power as he physically matures. Speed isn't a big part of his game, but he's savvy enough to run when he gets the chance.After primarily playing left field in his first two professional seasons, PERSON moved to right field in 2014. His defense remains a work in progress, but if he makes the strength gains he's expected to, he could develop into a prototypical corner outfielder in time.",1
"With 10 of its pitchers appearing in the Majors since the turn of the century, PERSON is known for producing mound talent. Yet the ORGANIZATION' two best big leaguers have been position players PERSON and PERSON, and they should have their first ever selected in the first round in 2017. PERSON went undrafted out of high school but has blossomed into a college star, finishing second in ORGANIZATION Division I with 21 home runs in 2016 and winning PERSON player of the year honors this spring, when he led the league in all three triple crown categories (.341-22-63) entering ORGANIZATION tournament play.Though he went homerless with the GPE college national team during the summer, scouts still recognize PERSON as one of the top power sources available in a Draft class short on college hitters. He generates his pop more with strength than bat speed, and there are some worries about an arm bar in his right-handed swing. He controls the strike zone well and makes reliable contact for a slugger, so he should hit for some average as well.While PERSON isn't the most graceful player, one scout compared him to PERSON for his ability to get the job done in less than pretty fashion. Despite his large frame, he has average speed out of the batter's box and decent range at third base. With his solid arm, reliable hands and admirable work ethic, he should be able to stay at the hot corner.",0
" PERSON jumped into the first round of the 2011 Draft because of his arm strength and projectability. In the early stages of his pro career â he didn't make his debut until 2012 â he's shown a solid feel for pitching to go along with his electric pure stuff. The LOCATION prep product has a plus fastball with a ton of sink that leads to a lot of ground-ball outs. His hard downer curve should be at least above-average and he continues to improve with his changeup, a pitch he didn't need or throw in high school. He has a clean delivery and the prototypical pitcher's body, which bodes well for a continuation of good control and command of his pitches.",0
"Somewhat surprisingly, our pitch classifications indicate PERSON threw his low-spin breaking ball more often than his obviously nasty changeup in a sizable big league sample last year. PERSON's weirdo breaking ball, which can be hard to distinguish visually from his changeup, is also effective and may give him a pitch mix sufficient to enable him to close. His stuff exploded after the ORGANIZATION moved him to the bullpen in 2016; they eventually traded him in the 2018 PERSON deal. He'll likely be a significant part of the ORGANIZATION' bullpen this season and may have too tight a grip on late-inning duties to relinquish them to PERSON once the latter returns from PERSON.",0
"Before the spring season began, the hope was PERSON could follow in the first-round footsteps of shortstops from GPE like PERSON and PERSON. Even if he wasn't quite at that level, some felt he had the raw tools to at least be in the conversation, but inconsistent performance has left his status a bit up in the air.While his uneven season has allowed PERSON to pass him by as the top PERSON player on GPE boards, PERSON's ability to stay up the middle should still be of interest. Defensively, he shows flashes of a plus arm when he gets his feet under him. He has good hands and his speed gives him range, though some feel second will be better for him in the future. His bat is behind his other tools, but he does have some power potential and could hit for average as well as he refines his approach.There is no longer talk about PERSON going in the first round, but he might have shown enough, especially later on in the summer showcase circuit, for a team to take a chance on the ORGANIZATION commit in the top five or six rounds.",0
"There have been some interesting pitching prospects in recent Drafts who came late to full-time pitching, including first-rounders PERSON in 2013 and PERSON in 2012. While GPE isn't quite that high-profile, he has the chance to do well now that he's focused only on the mound.An outfielder for his first two years at ORGANIZATION, GPE split time between playing that position and pitching as a sophomore then turned to pitching full-time in 2014. He's athletic, if a bit undersized, with the makings of two plus pitches in his fastball and spike curveball, which looks like a hard slider at times. He's working on developing his changeup.The jury is still out on whether GPE can start long-term -- sometimes a bias against undersized right-handers -- or he'll end up in the bullpen. Either way, his arm looks like it has a shot to pitch at the highest level.",0
"PERSON began his college career at ORGANIZATION, but he played sparingly as a freshman in 2011, before transferring to PERSON in GPE and then PERSON. There, PERSON grabbed attention in February '13, when he struck out PERSON, the eventual No. 2 overall pick, three times.PERSON mixes his low-to-mid-90s fastball effectively with a slider and a changeup. His delivery has some effort to it, though he is athletic enough to largely compensate for it.Some scouts think PERSON' delivery and short stature will ultimately push him to the bullpen. PERSON has used him as a reliever some this season, the club believes PERSON has the stuff to be a starter, and it will continue to develop him as one.",0
"GPE, a GPE commit, is a high risk, high reward type high school bat from the GPE area, one who could pay big dividends if it all clicks for him at the plate.There is a lot of projection with the bat, particularly in terms of his left-handed power. He can be very streaky at the plate, but he has good bat speed with lift and when he's on time with his mechanics and gets his foot down, he can hit the ball as hard as anyone. A center fielder in high school, he'll likely move to a corner spot at the next level, with left field a probable destination.GPE's tools are real, if a bit raw. If it clicks, he could develop into an everyday corner outfielder with some serious pop at the highest level.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON ORGANIZATION comes from a baseball family as his dad, PERSON, is the senior advisor to PERSON' ORGANIZATION A.J. Preller. The younger PERSON has committed to play at ORGANIZATION next season after finishing up his high school career at ORGANIZATION (Ariz.)PERSON plays multiple positions, and the versatility has served him well. PERSON has a savvy look on the diamond and possesses adequate skills at both catcher and first base.In the batter's box, he has a straightaway stance with a high back elbow.",0
"PERSON led ORGANIZATION III with 15 homers and a .918 slugging percentage in 2012, when the ORGANIZATION made him the highest-drafted D-III player in nine years by taking him 62nd overall. PERSON's production hasn't been as gaudy as a pro, in large part because he has devoted so much energy to refining his catching skills.While PERSON hasn't tapped into his plus raw power, his sound approach hasn't wavered. PERSON works counts and he focuses on driving the ball from gap to gap. The A's think he'll step up his offense, as his defense becomes more second nature to him.Oakland credits former big league catcher PERSON for helping PERSON improve behind the plate. At 6-foot-2 and 235 pounds, he's not the most agile backstop, but he has made strides with his receiving. PERSON has raw arm strength, but he needs to smooth out his throwing mechanics to better combat the running game.",0
"PERSON was a bit of a late riser in the LOCATION ranks, partially because his strong commitment to PERSON had scared scouts off, but mostly because a very strong spring had teams giving him a longer look despite that commitment. The 6-foot-4 right-hander reminds many scouts in the region of GPE, who would be a sure-fire first-round pick this year out of PERSON if he were healthy, when he was a high schooler in the area. PERSON's fastball is typically in the 88-92 mph range, with some room for added velocity from his loose and projectable frame, though he'll likely be more command than premium velocity in the future. He throws a slider and a curve, with the latter a much better offering, buckling knees with sharp bite coming from a high three-quarters slot. He does a nice job of sprinkling in his changeup. He can throw strikes with all four offerings.PERSON's name was moving up ORGANIZATION boards as his strong string of performances continued and some of his contemporaries stagnated or went backwards. Whether or not he's signable away from following in GPE's footsteps remains to be seen.Prospect Development PERSON - PERSON, GPE.",0
"The ORGANIZATION don't have a shortage on young power arms with electric stuff. PERSON definitely fits into that group and if the step forward he made in 2015 -- earning a promotion to full-season LOCATION and pitching meaningful ORGANIZATION playoff innings -- is any indication, he could rise to the top of it.PERSON lives off of a very good fastball-slider combination, and both are power pitches. He'll throw the fastball in the upper-90s with regularity and his slider continues to improve and could be a consistent swing-and-miss pitch in the future. Since he made his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2013, he's been working to improve his command and he threw more strikes after getting bumped up to the ORGANIZATION, a good sign. Everything PERSON throws is hard, so the ORGANIZATION are trying to get him work on his changeup, just to give hitters a different look.If the progress the 20-year-old showed while pitching ""under the lights"" for the first time continues, he could be coming to a bullpen near you in the future.",0
"The earliest-drafted pitcher ever from GPE, PERSON had a huge 2014 season that saw him start the PERSON in GPE, pitch well in Double-A and even made a start in Triple-A, all at age 20. He followed that up with another strong season in 2015, including a second straight PERSON start. PERSON pitches with the kind of confidence you like to see in a young starter. He has a live, quick arm that fires fastballs that touch 95-96 mph regularly and easily sits in the low-90s. His changeup is his best secondary offering, a sinking offspeed pitch which is very effective against left-handed hitters. His breaking ball is a hard slurve, thrown with good deception, and he'll vary the velocity and size of it to throw hitters off. PERSON is very athletic, repeating his delivery well and staying in and around the strike zone consistently. There isn't much more for PERSON to prove at the ORGANIZATION level. Because he just turned 21 during the 2015 season, there isn't any reason to rush him.",1
"PERSON reached the upper 90s with a fastball as an amateur, but he was hard to scout because he missed his high school senior season with a knee injury and worked a total of just 74 innings in three years of college at three different school. A fifth-round pick out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE in 2010, he first reached the Majors with the ORGANIZATION in 2013 but has yet to establish himself in the big leagues. He came to the ORGANIZATION along with PERSON in a July 2014 trade for PERSON Peavy.In order to improve his control, PERSON has dialed down his fastball. He usually works at 92-95 mph with some sink, though he was vulnerable to home runs in his time with GPE last season.PERSON operates mainly with his fastball and his slider/cutter, which can climb into the upper 80s. Once considered PERSON's possible closer of the future, he now projects as more of a middle reliever because he lacks a wipeout pitch and fine control.",1
"PERSON backed up his breakout 2017 campaign with a .313/.368/.430 2018 season line, mostly at Double-A. His swing is compact and rhythmic, and he's very difficult to beat with velocity because he can time just about everything. This, combined with an ability to guide the barrel around the zone, drives a promising, contact-first offensive package that would be quite valuable at catcher. PERSON moved from shortstop (in high school) to third base (as a college freshman) to catcher (as a sophomore) and has been behind the plate for four seasons now. He remains below-average in most aspects of catching, but isn't so bad that he'll surely have to move. He's not nearly as skilled a defender as PERSON, but PERSON has a much better chance to make an offensive impact. Yadier GPE is signed through 2020, which creates the illusion of a catching logjam, but he's somewhat fragile and PERSON and PERSON's experience at corner infield spots (PERSON has played some first base as a pro, but did not in 2018) could enable the Cardinals to carry all three of them at some point. If tasked with everyday duty, we think PERSON would produce like an average everyday player.",1
"A 13th-round pick in the 2015 Draft out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE, ORGANIZATION's advanced feel for pitching allowed him to dominate two levels of A-ball during his first full season. It's unclear how his stuff will play when he moves up, but he has the ORGANIZATION interested in finding out.ORGANIZATION operates largely with fringy stuff. His fastball will be in the 86-90 mph range and he'll occasionally flash an average curve and slider. His changeup is the one pitch that grades out as a tick above-average. He has been an extreme strike-thrower in his brief pro career, commanding all four pitches and keeping hitters guessing and off-balance consistently. Because none of his pitches truly stand out, there is little margin for error for ORGANIZATION. A big test will come when he gets the chance to move up to Double-A. He has the ceiling of a back-end starter, but he's had good success against left-handed hitters, so if the rotation doesn't work out, a future as a specialist out of the bullpen isn't out of the question.",0
"PERSON underwent PERSON surgery in July 2009, costing him his senior season of high school. He proved he was fully recovered at ORGANIZATION Community College and was drafted in the fifth round in 2012. PERSON's fastball, which he pairs with an above-average curveball, sits in the low-90s. He also throws a changeup, which is improving. PERSON has good command and had a productive debut at ORGANIZATION in 2012, posting a 2.95 ERA and striking out 44 batters in 42 2/3 innings. He struggled initially in 2013 after being double-jumped to the ORGANIZATION State League, but did show signs of improvement late in the year.",0
"GPE seems to produce an enticing, projectable high school arm in just about every Draft, and GPE fit that profile when he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $897,500 as a third-rounder in 2014. PERSON didn't bring him to full-season ball until his fourth pro season, giving him time to add strength and improve his pitches. His stuff ticked up at the end of 2018, when he posted a 1.95 ERA in nine Double-A starts, and the ORGANIZATION landed him in December as the headline prospect in a three-team deal that shipped PERSON to the A's and lefty prospect PERSON to PERSON has boosted his fastball velocity and his ability to maintain it since turning pro, now working at 90-94 mph and topping out at 96 with some running action. He has some power and late bite with his slider, which has developed into a solid second offering. He also has some feel for throwing a fading changeup, which he continues to refine in order to combat right-handers.GPE had scattershot control coming out of high school but is doing a much better job of throwing strikes now. He still needs to refine his location in order to reach his ceiling as a mid-rotation starter. He has deception in his delivery that makes it difficult for hitters to square his pitches up.",1
"Since signing for a $1.3 million bonus -- a record for a GPE player -- in January 2010, PERSON advanced rapidly to Double-A. He has the best combination of raw power and pure arm strength among PERSON catchers, though he's still polishing those tools and the other aspects of his game. Unfortunately for him, his 2015 season was put on hold when he underwent surgery on his left ankle in June. That didn't keep the Phillies from wanting him, making sure he was included in the package they received in return for PERSON has the strength and bat speed to drive balls out of any part of any ballpark without selling out for power, yet he's still overly aggressive at the plate. He swings and misses frequently, and he needs to do a better job of taking pitches and recognizing breaking balls. If he figures it out, he could be an average hitter with 20-plus homers per season in the big leagues. Similarly, he has a cannon arm and good athleticism for a catcher but needs a lot of refinement behind the plate. He threw out just 28 percent of basestealers and committed 23 passed balls in 90 games in 2014. Though he has played first base and tried the outfield in instructional league play, it's too soon to give up on the idea that he can become an All-Star catcher.",1
"Though the ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON out of high school as a pitcher, it became evident his future was as a hitter when he led ORGANIZATION Division I in batting (.465) and homers (28) as a sophomore at GPE Tennessee State in 2009. A supplemental first-rounder a year later, he advanced steadily through the Minors before getting slowed by leg, knee and hamstring injuries the last two seasons.A healthy PERSON does have the tools to make it as a right fielder in the Majors. He has well above-average power and is an effective hitter when he focuses on going gap to gap rather than trying to crush the ball. He gets out of control at the plate, uppercutting and pulling pitches, and he'll probably always rack up large numbers of strikeouts.PERSON's strong arm is a good fit for right field, and he covers a decent amount of ground there. He can lose focus on defense at times, however.",0
"GPE is emerging as a market for international prospects, and PERSON has positioned himself as the top young player from the country in this year's class.The young infielder has a chance to be special and here are a few reasons why: PERSON is a big bodied athlete with a plus bat, plus power and plus arm potential. He's a decent shortstop now and projects to be an above-average defender at third base, the position many scouts believe he will play as he grows and his body matures. Overall, evaluators like his hands and defensive actions. There's still room for improvement in terms of body control and footwork, but that's not uncommon for infielders his age.At the plate, he has already shown good strength and has a chance to develop more power as he grows. The tools are there and he's expected to hone his overall game once he signs with a club and enters its academy.PERSON is from GPE, GPE, and trains with former big league infielder PERSON. The ORGANIZATION are the favorite to sign him.",0
"A top closer who racked up 40 saves at GPE in 2012 and 2013, PERSON looked like he was going to be a quick-to-the-big-leagues college reliever when he reached Double-A in his first full season of pro ball in 2014 and capped it off with a very strong ORGANIZATION performance. He went backwards in 2015, however, struggling with command, though he righted the ship in 2016, pitching across three levels of the Minors.Only six-feet, 175 pounds, PERSON still has the kind of electric stuff teams like to have in the back end of a bullpen. His fastball will sit in the 96-97 mph range with big-time boring action. His slider gives him a second above-average pitch with quick and late bite. Both miss plenty of bats, and PERSON can also induce ground-ball outs. He'll even mix in a changeup to keep hitters honest.The biggest thing holding PERSON back had been his command. He walked more than four batters per nine innings in his career, a rate that improved considerably in 2016, showing he might have the stuff to close games at the next level. At worst, PERSON could serve as a very effective setup man in the near future.",0
"At 6-foot-7 and 230 pounds, PERSON looks more like he should be playing football (most of his college scholarship offers were as a tight end) or basketball (he has a close physical resemblance to ORGANIZATION star PERSON). He also has drawn comparisons to Hall of ORGANIZATION, who played in eight straight All-Star Games for the ORGANIZATION, and PERSON Stanton.The 32nd overall pick in the 2013 Draft and recipient of a $1.8 million bonus, PERSON has huge power potential. He uses his leverage and strength to crush balls, and he has a two-homer game against GPE. 1 overall pick PERSON and the ORGANIZATION title on his resume. With his long arms, his swing can get very long as well, which results in strikeouts and reduces his ability to hit for average.PERSON moves very well for a big man, with his solid speed and strong arm making him a nice fit in right field. He has yet to make his debut because he arrived in pro ball with a quad injury, yet PERSON could move quickly if he makes consistent contact.",1
"After two nondescript years at ORGANIZATION, PERSON jumped on the radar with a strong junior season, building off an All-Star campaign in the ORGANIZATION League the previous summer. The top college prospect in GPE in the 2017 Draft class, he was taken by the ORGANIZATION in the fourth round and given a slightly above-pick value bonus to sign. Pitching in relief in the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League during his debut, PERSON struck out 12.8 per nine innings, then followed it up with a solid first full year in the LOCATION, once again striking out better than 10 per nine.With a quick arm and a strong frame, PERSON can run his fastball up to 96 mph and sit at 93-94 and while his velocity had dipped after heavy use in his last college season, he proved durable and effective over his first full season, finishing with 131 innings pitched. He's fiddled with different versions of a breaking ball in the past, but now features a hard slider/cutter that has good, late life. PERSON can spin a curveball with good depth and has aptitude for throwing a changeup. His fastball, slider and changeup all can be plus pitches at their best, so he has the ingredients to start. In order to succeed in that role as he moves up the ORGANIZATION' ladder, he will have to continue to refine his overall control and command (3.7 BB/9 through 2018).",0
"In a system deep in power bullpen arms, PERSON has flown under the radar, partially because of injury issues. Coming back healthy in 2015 has him set up to make more noise in 2016 and beyond.Signed out of GPE in September 2010, PERSON first made the move to the bullpen in winter ball in his home country in 2013. He's been a reliever since, though he missed considerable time in 2014 and the start of 2015 with a shoulder impingement. The right-hander did avoid surgery, and the ORGANIZATION mostly wanted 2015 to be about PERSON staying healthy. He did just that and put up good numbers as a bonus. PERSON misses plenty of bats with a fastball that sits in the 93-96 mph range. His best secondary offering is his changeup, while his curveball is inconsistent but has improved of late. The ORGANIZATION were encouraged with how PERSON threw at the end of the ORGANIZATION season in 2105, including eight scoreless innings in the playoffs, and feel PERSON has the chance to be a big league setup man in the future.",0
"One of the more talented prospects cut loose by the ORGANIZATION during their international scandal, PERSON's fastball creeps into the mid-90s, and he has a good curveball and a sturdy build that is admittedly less projectable than is typical for a 19-year-old. His strike-throwing took a step forward in 2018, but his profile includes fairly significant relief risk. He spent all of 2018 at Low-A Lexington but has dealt with a biceps issue this spring, and isn't currently at an affiliate. He's in that No. 4 or 5 starter/potential late-inning reliever area as far as stuff goes, and is probably several years away from the majors.",0
"The 2013 Draft already is shaping up as one of the ORGANIZATION' best in years. First-rounders PERSON, PERSON and PERSON are three of the system's top prospects; fourth-rounder PERSON's stock continues to climb; and seventh-rounder PERSON already has debuted in GPE. Another member of that bumper crop to watch is PERSON, an 18th-rounder who signed for $278,000.PERSON has some of the best all-around tools among ORGANIZATION farmhands. His two most obvious attributes are his speed and center-field defense, both of which grade as plus. He has solid arm strength and can play all three outfield positions.PERSON also has some intriguing offensive upside. He has hit for average in the lower levels of the ORGANIZATION, though he'll have to tighten his strike-zone discipline to do so against more advanced pitching. He has enough raw power to hit 15 or more homers per season, and he should be a basestealing threat as well.",1
"  PERSON put together a solid career at ORGANIZATION and was considered one of the best college hitters in the 2013 Draft class. He got off to a slow start as a professional before finishing the 2014 season strong with high Class A Stockton, and has built on that momentum this year in Double-A.PERSON has a short, quick swing with loft, giving him the potential to hit for both average and power. He does a good job of making contact and using the entire field to hit.The A's have used PERSON at both first and third base, but playing with PERSON and PERSON in 2014 meant that he played more DH than anything else. PERSON profiles best at first base, but no matter where he settles defensively, it'll be up to his bat to get him to the ORGANIZATION.",0
"A two-time member of the Pac-12 All-Defensive Team during his time at GPE, PERSON's abilities in center field have never been questioned. His hitting ability, on the other hand, drew mixed reviews from scouts leading up to the 2015 GPE. The ORGANIZATION, believing in his bat, took him in the third round of the GPE, and he rewarded them in his pro debut by finishing second in the Class A Short PERSON with a .320 average. He made his full-season debut in '16, splitting the year between the GPE and GPE, and then returned to the latter stop in 2017 to earn All-Star honors before moving up to Double-A in July.A well-above-average runner and defender, PERSON makes it look easy in center field with his great jumps and exceptional range. That speed also makes him a threat on the basepaths, though he does have gains to make with both his technique and feel for reading pitchers. Offensively, PERSON has good bat speed from the right side of the plate, and he's shorter to the ball now after working with the ORGANIZATION to clean up his swing last summer. He should add some strength as he matures, which should lead to more gap power, but he's never going to be a home-run threat.Whether PERSON can reach his ceiling as a top-of-the-order center fielder will depend on how much his bat develops moving forward. Even if it doesn't, he still has a chance to be a big leaguer based on the merits of his speed-defense combo,",0
" PERSON began the 2012 season in a prospect-laden PERSON rotation along with 2011 first-rounders PERSON and PERSON, but it was PERSON alone who pitched himself up to Double-A Huntsville. The big, strong right-hander features a heavy fastball that elicits ground balls and sits in the low 90s. His slider has the chance to be above average and he was much better at commanding it than he had been in the past. His changeup is still below average, though he threw it more effectively in 2012. His overall command isn't great, but his deception and sink give him the chance to start. If the command doesn't come, his stuff could play up in a bullpen role if needed.",1
"PERSON had one of the best college catchers in the 2016 Draft in GPE, who signed with the ORGANIZATION as a second-rounder. The ORGANIZATION again have one of top college backstops this spring in GPE, who spent his freshman season at ORGANIZATION (Calif.) JC and started on the infield corners for PERSON in 2016. Despite an injury to his left hand at the beginning of 2017 and a jammed right shoulder in May that clouded his Draft status, he had as many homers (14) and a higher slugging percentage (.592) entering the ORGANIZATION playoffs than teammate and 2018 early-first-round candidate PERSON Beer.GPE' best tool is his plus right-handed raw power, though there are some mixed reviews on his bat. He can crush fastballs but some scouts worry about his ability to handle quality breaking pitches at the next level. He gets overly pull-conscious and doesn't show much patience at the plate, limiting his ability to hit for average.GPE still has work to do behind the plate. He has an average arm albeit with a long release that leads to concerns as to how he'll fare against pro basestealers, and his receiving needs more polish. If he doesn't make it as a catcher, he has enough power potential and athletic ability that he might be able to profile at first base or left field.",0
"Any time there's a left-handed pitcher who can touch 97 mph and hit 95 mph with regularity, people are going to notice. PERSON has one of the more electric left arms in the Minors, one that has shown the ability to dominate at each level he's pitched. He did fade in the second half of 2012, but his .201 batting average against did lead the organization. His power breaking ball can be unhittable when his mechanics are right, but it's inconsistent and it can get slurvy. He sometimes will show feel for a changeup, but that too needs some work. The 2012 Futures Gamer also needs to refine his command in order to make his stuff more effective. That's what will determine if he can start long-term or eventually will have to move to the bullpen.",1
"If you're a big, strong lefty with good command in the ORGANIZATION system, you're bound to be compared, however unfairly, to PERSON. But PERSON welcomes it and even got the chance to apprentice under PERSON when the veteran came to GPE en route to his 2012 comeback. With a great pitching frame, he has the chance to have four Major League average or better pitches. His fastball is up to 92 mph at times and he can command it to both sides of the plate. His curve has some nasty bite to it at times. When he's executing it well, it freezes hitters. His changeup also has the chance to be very effective and it dives at times. He competes well, gets ahead and finds a way to keep his team in games even without his best stuff.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",0
"PERSON drew little attention from scouts as an PERSON high schooler in 2012, when he was a slight southpaw who topped out at 90 mph. His fastball and profile have taken off since he went to college, and he helped the Fighting Illini win 27 straight games this spring after starring with the GPE collegiate national team last summer. Now he's a lock to become the second first-round pick ever produced by PERSON, following PERSON in 1988, and he's the consensus best left-hander in the 2015 Draft.He is still not very physical at 6-foot-1 and 175 pounds, but PERSON now works at 93-95 mph and peaks at 98 mph with his fastball, even when he works on consecutive days. He generates that heat with athleticism and a quick arm rather than an excessive amount of effort in his delivery.PERSON has a deeper repertoire than most relievers. His plus slider is his second-best pitch, and he also has a curveball with power and depth and shows signs of interesting changeup. He has enough pitches and control to lead a pro team to consider trying him as a starter, though he lacks size and could speed to the Majors if he remains a reliever.",0
"It might be difficult to find a better athlete in the 2012 Draft class and there certainly isn't anyone faster. While he's sure to be a major basestealing threat, he's much more than a one-tool guy. PERSON has the chance to hit, with good bat speed and even a bit of power to grow into. There's some refining to his approach that will need to happen, but he has an understanding of what his game will need to be hitting at the top of the lineup. He's able to outrun any mistakes in the outfield, but projects to be an above-average defender in the future. He's been compared to PERSON, not a bad aspiration, but he might have the chance to have a little more pop and a little less swing-and-miss if things click for him.",0
"PERSON signed for the fifth highest bonus in the 2017 July 2nd class, among a few already-elite prospects like ORGANIZATION of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON shortstop PERSON, PERSON outfielder PERSON and ORGANIZATION shortstop PERSON. PERSON could be next in line to jump into the 50 FV tier during the 2019 season, building on a solid pro debut in 2018, where he improved his already-impressive tool profile. To clarify any confusion, it's worth noting that there is another, very similar middle infield prospect with the ORGANIZATION the same name who was also born in the same year. The ORGANIZATION' PERSON has an above average hit tool to go with above average speed, defense, and arm strength at shortstop, so it won't be a long journey to turn into a regular if he can maintain those current tools. He's played just 43 official minor league games and has an unsustainably-high .418 ORGANIZATION, but the performance also supports the standout skillset. Some scouts argue there isn't a plus tool here other than arm strength, so you can't stuff PERSON too high until he's done a little more in official games, but he's already among the top 200 prospects or so in baseball. Some see sneaky potential average raw power down the road, which PERSON could mostly get to in games if he ends up being the plus hitter that some are projecting, though some scouts see 45 hit and 40 power, given the limited pro looks they've had. It's also worth noting that PERSON has become close friends with PERSON; the pair could team up to form half of the infield of the future in GSP. PERSON will definitely be one to watch closely in 2019 as there's some in-season ceiling to his potential ranking, particularly if he can perform the way the ORGANIZATION' PERSON did this past year; that PERSON reached High-A at age 18.",0
"After PERSON helped ORGANIZATION win the 2014 College World Series and starred with the GPE collegiate national team and in the ORGANIZATION during the summer, he entered last year as the top-rated prospect on the ORGANIZATION -- ahead of eventually ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick PERSON and ORGANIZATION. 8 choice PERSON. PERSON missed his first two starts with elbow soreness and never really looked 100 percent, concluding his junior season by getting knocked out early in the final game of the ORGANIZATION. He dropped to the ORGANIZATION with the 24th overall pick and signed for a below-slot $1,777,500 at the deadline amid reports that he needed PERSON surgery, which he had in early August.When fully healthy as a sophomore, PERSON displayed four pitches that graded as solid or better and threw them all for strikes. He consistently worked at 90-96 mph with his fastball, with its command more notable than its life. He throws two distinct breaking balls and can miss bats with both his curveball and slider, as well as with his changeup.Even before he got hurt, there were some concerns as to whether PERSON's slight build could hold up to the demands of being a pro starter. He had no physical issues before his elbow gave out, however, and his athleticism and ability to repeat his sound delivery enabled him to maintain quality stuff deep into games.",1
"Typically, international prospects are signed as teenagers and when they come to the GPE, there's as much emotional and cultural growth that needs to take place as there is physical. PERSON, on the other hand, signed just days before he turned 22 and thus came to the Pirates with plenty of maturity. That's allowed him to move fast -- three levels of the Minors followed by being absolutely dominant in the ORGANIZATION in 2016 -- all of which led to his first big league callup in 2017.PERSON dials up his fastball to 96-97 mph on most nights and can touch a tick higher on occasion. He has good depth and life on his heater, getting a ton of ground-ball outs. The consistency, shape and spin of his slider has improved and when he keeps his front side in, it's a true out pitch. He fills the strike zone with both offerings.Perhaps because PERSON didn't play a lot of baseball early on, he has a fresh arm and still has upside. He doesn't quite have the mentality to close just yet, but he could eventually get there.",0
"For the second straight year, a big left-hander named PERSON has had scouts flocking to the ORGANIZATION. In 2013, a LOCATION CC southpaw by that name signed for $1.2 million as a second-round pick of the ORGANIZATION. This year, an ORGANIZATION high school lefty with the same name could go in the same area of the Draft.Reed has created plenty of buzz by boosting his fastball velocity from 88-90 mph in the past to 92-95 as a senior. When he stays on top of his breaking ball, he can snap off a sharp slider with depth, though at times it devolves into a slower slurve. He shows some fade with his changeup and the willingness to use it.Reed's weight ballooned to 260 pounds this spring, and while scouts think he needs to get in better shape, they also wonder what might happen to his velocity when he does. The ORGANIZATION recruit works in the strike zone but will have to locate his pitches better against more advanced competition.",1
"The ORGANIZATION were initially attracted to PERSON because of his abilities at the plate, and they believed he would develop into a good defender. He has done just that, with his defense progressing even faster than expected.PERSON threw out 42 percent of would-be basestealers in 2013, leading the ORGANIZATION. He has improved his game management, and he uses his athleticism well behind the plate. A switch-hitter, PERSON makes consistent hard contact from both sides of the plate. His swing is more geared for line drives now, but he projects to have average power. PERSON has toned down his aggressive approach somewhat, though he wouldn't be confused with a patient hitter. He is faster than most catchers, and he isn't a baseclogger.PERSON is still a work in progress, but he has the potential to be an impact player in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"One of the more exciting high school arms in the 2014 GPE class, PERSON was the third prep pitcher taken that June, going No. 16 overall to the ORGANIZATION. A year later, on PERSON's 19th birthday, the right-hander was dealt to the ORGANIZATION, basically in return for taking on PERSON's salary.PERSON struggled post-trade. PERSON of one of the best curveballs in his GPE class, he was limited in his use of it initially because the D-backs wanted him to improve his other pitches and not rely on the curve too much. As a result, he was inconsistent with it for much of the season. When he got to instructs, it all started to click again. PERSON had struggled with fastball command due to some mechanical issues and the coaches started to iron them out. He has the chance to have two plus pitches with his fastball and curve and while the changeup is behind the other two, it could be at least average.PERSON tried to do too much to justify the trade, but when he got to instructs, he hit the reset button and went to work. Now relaxing, he can use his combination of stuff and althleticsm to propel him up the ladder.",1
"PERSON was dominant for a month and a half at ORGANIZATION but his strikeout rate was sawed in half after he was promoted to Hi-A Frederick. A vertical arm slot creates a tough angle on PERSON's fastball and vertical action on his breaking stuff. It also makes it hard for him to have east/west command, and a large portion of the industry has PERSON projected to the bullpen because of this. Dissenters believe his repertoire depth (four average pitches) fits at the back of a rotation.",0
"The ORGANIZATION accomplished three objectives in a November 2017 trade with the Marlins: clearing spots on their 40-man roster by dealing PERSON and PERSON, acquiring international bonus pool money and grabbing King. GPE had drafted him in the 12th round in 2016, when he earned PERSON's lone victory in the only ORGANIZATION super-regional appearance in the program's history. He had a spectacular season after changing organizations, ranking second in the Minors in GPE (1.79) and third in GPE (0.91) while rising from PERSON to Triple-A, but has yet to pitch in 2019 after getting diagnosed with a stress reaction in his elbow in GPE, but missed the first three months of the 2019 season after getting diagnosed with a stress reaction in his elbow in GPE.King's success centers on precision command of a two-seam fastball that sits at 92-95 mph. He can run or sink his heater to either corner of the plate, and he's an extreme ground-ball pitcher with a career groundout/airout ratio of 1.7 through his first three pro seasons. The ORGANIZATION also helped him improve his secondary pitches, leading to a jump in his strikeout rate from 6.3 per nine innings in two years in GPE's system to 8.5 in his first in GPE York's.Both King's slider and changeup can be solid pitches when they're working, and evaluators generally prefer his slider by a slight margin. He has the best control and command among ORGANIZATION pitching prospects and one of the highest floors as well. Regarded as a finesse right-hander who might fit at the back of a rotation at the time of his trade, he now he appears to be more than that.",0
"Natural defender with below average footspeed, arm may limit to second base, some projection with limited now strength but solid contact-oriented switch hitter.",0
"PERSON was noticed early in his career at ORGANIZATION for showing early round tools as a defender who can stay in the middle infield with above average raw power and some feel to hit. The feel to hit came into question in his draft year, as his swing got a little too pull/power oriented, helping him slip to the fourth round. The Jays rave about PERSON's makeup and preparation, and how he spearheaded the adjustments to his swing to have a shorter path to the ball and increase his contact ability. He now has a flatter-planed swing, and one scout compared his offense to PERSON, while another thinks PERSON is a 50 hitter with 50 game power. Most scouts think he's fringy at shortstop despite a plus arm, and would shift him to second base long-term for the best fit, where he's got a chance to be above average. An 85 to 100 wRC+ with solid average defense at second base is worth 2-something WAR, so while it isn't sexy, there's some performance here, real changes to explain it, and a pretty good chance to be a 50 or 55 FV big leaguer.",0
"The PERSON went above pick value to sign the GPE high school infielder, and they did so largely for his bat. With strong hands and a quick bat, PERSON shows the ability to hit line drives to the gap, and he should develop average power as he physically matures. A shortstop in high school, the PERSON tried PERSON at second and third base after he signed. They eventually settled on developing him as a second baseman. As he gets more comfortable there, he projects to develop into a good offensive-minded second baseman.",0
"The way PERSON has pitched in 2013, it's somewhat curious why he wasn't the school's Friday starter from the start of the season. Regardless, he's pitched like one, showing a three-pitch mix and the ability to throw strikes with all three.PERSON's fastball will touch 93-94 mph and it has some late sink to it, giving him the ability to generate ground-ball outs. When he stays on top of his breaking ball, it's a solid curve with good tilt to it. He doesn't throw his changeup much, and it needs some work, but it has the chance to be a third average offering.Tall and strong, PERSON may not be among the elite-level college arms in this class, but he may not be too far behind.",1
"The first half of PERSON's 2015 campaign at ORGANIZATION A Advanced ORGANIZATION mirrored his performance from his first full season, when he showed plus power but struggled to make consistent contact and get on base. But he began to find his stride at the plate in July while playing for PERSON in the ORGANIZATION Am Games, and then hit 16 homers over his final 151 at-bats back at ORGANIZATION. He finished the year with 32 home runs, tying for the second-highest total in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's explosive bat speed generates effortless plus power, and he's strong enough to drive the ball out of the park even when he doesn't catch it flush on the barrel. While he understands the strike zone, he can get over anxious and chase breaking balls off the plate, while also get too pull-happy at times. Once he can find the balance between his hitting ability and power, he has the chance to hit for average in addition to the light-tower power. A former high school catcher, PERSON has slightly above-average arm strength and good athleticism, though he's a fringy defender at both corner outfield spots.Many scouts expected PERSON to struggle with the move to Double-A in 2016, but that has been anything but the case. The youngster has received raves for his capacity to make adjustments, while advancements in his approach and plate discipline have led to a drastically reduced strikeout rate. PERSON looks more and more like a future middle-of-the-order run producer, though the Mariners have no plans to rush him to the big leagues.",1
" PERSON mostly played shortstop in high school, but when he moved behind the plate in his senior year, he gave many teams, including the ORGANIZATION, an idea. PERSON let PERSON played the infield during his pro debut after signing an above-pick value bonus, then moved him behind the plate for the 2014 season. Heading back to the ORGANIZATION, where he made his pro debut, has helped. PERSON has a quick left-handed swing with a solid approach at the plate. As he adds strength, he should add some power down the line. He's runs OK for a catcher and is not a base-clogger. He's solid across the board defensively, though he has a ways to go to become a complete catcher. The ORGANIZATION rave about PERSON's makeup and the natural leadership skills teams love to see in their regular backstops.",1
"The son of former big league player and manager and current GPE bench coach PERSON, PERSON has the advanced instincts expected from someone who grew up around the game. He also has an intriguing toolset as well and could be a top-three-rounds pick if he's considered signable away from his commitment to Rice.A switch-hitter, PERSON shows a quick bat and good approach from both sides of the plate. He shows power potential from both sides as well -- perhaps more as a lefty despite being a natural righty -- and should begin to realize it once he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame.An average runner with a solid, accurate arm and defensive savvy, PERSON may be able to stay at shortstop. Even if he can't, he has enough quickness to profile at second base and the bat to handle the offensive demands at third base.",0
"The Mariners have never been shy about being aggressive in the international market, and they weren't when they gave PERSON seven figures to sign out of Venezuela.Unlike some of the hard throwers in the system, PERSON relies more on command and control. His fastball sits in the low 90s, at best, and he couples it with solid yet unspectacular secondary stuff in his curve and his changeup. PERSON is a serious strike-thrower, though, keeping the ball down in the zone consistently, which allows his stuff to play up. At 6-foot-0 and 255 pounds, there's no projection here.Still only a teenager, PERSON's pitchabilty could allow him to move quickly, even if his ceiling maxes out as a No. 4-type starter.",0
"After pitching with an upper-80s fastball on the showcase circuit last summer, PERSON dedicated himself to getting stronger in the offseason. His work paid off when he came out touching 93 mph early this spring and held his improved velocity throughout his senior season. He could go as early as the third round and figures to get picked high enough to sign him away from an Ohio State commitment.PERSON now operates in the low 90s early in games and should throw a bit harder as he continues to develop physically. He can flash a good curveball at times but it's below average at others and he can't always land it in the strike zone. He shows some feel for his changeup, which has fade and should become an effective third pitch.PERSON is athletic and has a clean delivery, so he should be able to iron out the inconsistencies with his control and command. Though he's not especially tall, he uses a high-three-quarters arm slot to create downhill plane on his pitches.",0
"In the final year of LOCATION CC's baseball program, ORGANIZATION set school records for hitting (.419) and home runs (16) in 2016 before signing with the ORGANIZATION as a fourth-rounder. He has continued to mash in pro ball, leading the Rookie-level PERSON in runs (63), total bases (161) and ORGANIZATION (1.052) during his pro debut. In his first full season, he won GPE League MVP honors and topped the high Class A circuit in extra-base hits (61) and slugging (.514).Built along the lines of PERSON, ORGANIZATION has similar huge raw right-handed power and a strong arm. His strength and the leverage in his 6-foot-6 frame allow him to crush balls out of any part of any ballpark, though his size also leads to a naturally long swing. His 189 strikeouts also led the ORGANIZATION and he'll have to reduce his 32 percent strikeout rate, though he also demonstrated some selectivity by finishing second with 64 walks.Surprisingly athletic for a big man, ORGANIZATION shows average speed out of the batter's box and is faster than that once he gets going. Though he spent the majority of his first two pro seasons in center field, he doesn't have the speed and instincts to remain there. He's destined for right field and has the power and arm to fit the profile there.",0
"PERSON popped up this spring and is sitting in the mid-90's with a chance to start, slotting just behind PERSON, J.J. Goss and PERSON in the Houston-area pitcher rankings.",0
"Drafted by his hometown team, GPE took a step forward in 2013, pitching in the ORGANIZATION. He took a step back in 2014 while repeating the Double-A LOCATION, but he landed on the temporary inactive list in late June due to his struggles.When he's on top of his game, GPE has drawn comparisons to PERSON, both for his size and his stuff. He can throw his fastball in the low-90s from a three-quarters arm slot. GPE throws a changeup and a big sweeping curveball, which is his best offspeed pitch. All three of his pitches have a chance to be at least Major League-average offerings.GPE has struggled with his control throughout his professional career, and finding a way to improve it will be critical to his success as a starter in the ORGANIZATION. If he can lower his walk rate, GPE profiles as a middle-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"PERSON might have gone in the top five rounds of the 2013 Draft based on talent, but signability dropped him to the ORGANIZATION in the 40th round. After a late-season surge left him leading the LOCATION with 14 homers entering ORGANIZATION tournament play, he should go around the third this time around. He doesn't have a true plus tool but he's at least average across the board and can play up the middle, claims few college players in this Draft class can match.PERSON hit .284 with a total of nine homers in his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION, and he struck out in 37 percent of his plate appearances and slugged just .344 with wood bats in the ORGANIZATION last summer. He's doing a much better job of recognizing offspeed pitches and making contact this spring. He employed more of a line-drive approach in the past but is driving the ball more consistently now and has the bat speed and strength for at least average power.His solid speed and instincts should allow PERSON to remain in center field, where his arm is stronger than most at the position. His quickness should enable him to steal a few bases but he needs to refine his technique.",0
"Acquired in the April 2018 trade that sent ORGANIZATION Hernandez to the ORGANIZATION' organization, PERSON is a questionable hitter but has 80 raw power that seems poised to go off the charts at times with booming home runs that would leave any stadium in the GPE. He hit 35 home runs in 104 games for PERSON after the trade and his 36 total homers tied him for the ORGANIZATION lead.While there is no question about PERSON's ability to hit the ball out of the park, there are many worries about him making enough contact to use that power in games as he moves up the ladder. In 2018, PERSON also struck out 152 times or 36 percent of his at-bats. He has below average running ability and is below average as a defender. He does have an average arm and could be occasionally utilized in right field, where he played eight games for PERSON.PERSON could be a more athletic version of PERSON if he can refine his overall approach at the plate and harness his raw power. Otherwise, he's a likely one-trick pony who will hit the tape-measure homers and do little else, which would make it harder for him to reach the big leagues.",0
"A 40th-round pick of the ORGANIZATION in 2014, PERSON passed on launching his pro career in favor of attending PERSON. He made strides in each of his three seasons there and was one of the top performers in the LOCATION as a junior, showing improved hitting ability and power as well as second-base defense. PERSON's breakout campaign in college baseball's best league stood out in a thin crop of college hitters, and the ORGANIZATION were thrilled to find him still on the board in the third round. PERSON has a nice left-handed swing, shows good feel for the barrel and drives the ball across the entire field. After totaling six homers across his first two collegiate seasons, PERSON added some loft to his stroke and finally tapped into his raw power in 2017 to finish with 41 extra-base hits, including a team-high 15 home runs. An above-average runner, he moves well once underway but doesn't figure to be a stolen-base threat. Defensively, PERSON has looked comfortable at second base after previously struggling as a shortstop. He profiles as a passable defender there, one who can also play the outfield corners as well as first base. However, any future moves down the defensive spectrum will come with increased offensive demands.",0
"Showing no ill effects from 2012 PERSON surgery, PERSON joined fellow lefty PERSON to form two-thirds of GPE State's very effective weekend rotation in 2014.PERSON uses deception and pitchability to allow his average stuff to play up. His fastball will top out in the low 90s, but it has a good amount of sink and tail to it. He'll add and subtract from his curveball to give hitters different looks, and his changeup often features good sink. He attacks hitters well, though he can get into trouble when he doesn't keep his stuff down in the zone.PERSON may not wow scouts with plus stuff, but guys who perform well, especially in a conference like the PAC-12, tend to do well on GPE day.",1
" The third player taken from GPE in the 2011 Draft, the D-backs are very excited about what PERSON might become one day. Much of it is projection at this point, though he finished among the league leaders in a host of offensive categories in the ORGANIZATION in 2012. Thereâs definite power in his left-handed swing and heâll tap into it even more as he becomes a better all-around hitter. His solid arm allowed him to throw out 52 percent of would-be basestealers in 2012, though the rest of his receiving skills have a ways to go. If that comes together, he has the chance to be an exciting all-around backstop.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION as a shortstop for $170,000 in 2013, PERSON moved to the mound after hitting .198/.312/.256 in his pro debut. He has made rapid progress since posting a 6.42 ERA in his GPE debut in 2015, passing several more hyped Dodgers pitching prospects to make his big league debut last June. After beating the ORGANIZATION while getting knocked around in relief, he went on the disabled list with a strained rotator cuff and missed the rest of 2018.PERSON has plenty of velocity on his fastball, working at 93-95 mph and reaching 98, though it's even more notable for nasty sink that keeps it off barrels and creates a lot of groundouts. His hard slider can be a wipeout pitch at times and keeps right-handers at bay, though it's not as consistent as his fastball and sometimes looks more like a curveball. He has made progress with developing his changeup and had more success against left-handers last year than in the past.PERSON sometimes struggles to command his pitches because he has so much life on his fastball and utilizes a crossfire delivery. He does throw enough strikes for GPE and most scouts to project him as a starter, with one organization rating him as the system's best prospect at the outset of 2019. If he winds up in the bullpen, he has the stuff to serve as a setup man or perhaps even a closer.",1
"PERSON led GPE's top league with a 2.06 ERA as an 18-year-old during the 2014-15 season before defecting in May 2015. The ORGANIZATION originally signed him for a $5.15 million bonus in September 2016, voided the deal when a physical led to concerns about his elbow, then re-signed him for $2 million (plus a matching amount in penalty tax) that December. He expressed frustration with the process afterward and has stayed healthy since while making it to PERSON ahead of schedule this July.His fastball parked around 90 mph in GPE, but PERSON now sits at 93-95 mph and peaks at 98 with sink that generates ground balls. His slider has gotten harder and tighter, working in the low 80s, and his changeup has improved as well. He has three pitches that grade as at least solid as well as a slow curveball that isn't as reliable.PERSON has lived up to his reputation for advanced pitchability. He's not physical but has a quick arm and little effort in his delivery, which he repeats well. While he began his big league career in the bullpen and the elbow issue and his diminutive build raise questions about his durability as a starter, his efficiency helps his cause.",1
"PERSON grew up in GPE Jersey but wasn't drawing much exposure as a high school infielder/pitcher, so he decided to move to the ORGANIZATION before what would have been his senior season. His arm strength took off once he returned to his parents' homeland, making him a coveted international free agent who landed a $950,000 bonus in December 2012.PERSON since has emerged as the preeminent power arm in the ORGANIZATION system. He has two legitimate swing-and-miss pitches in a 93-95 mph fastball that can reach triple digits and an upper-70s curveball that combines power and depth. He has an easy delivery that bodes well for his long-term health.Still somewhat raw on the mound, PERSON has yet to show much consistency with his changeup, control and command. He has a sturdy frame that carries more than his listed 185 pounds, and he'll have to watch his conditioning.",1
"The first of two consecutive high school arms the ORGANIZATION took in the first round, PERSON has followed a developmental path most teams hope a prep pitcher will follow. The GPE native went to full-season ball in his first full professional year and pitched well there under a fairly tight pitch count and innings limit. In year two, the gloves came off and the right-hander earned a midseason promotion to Double-A while also pitching well in the ORGANIZATION Game.Much of PERSON' success has come as a result of his plus fastball. It will sit in the low 90s and will consistently touch the mid-90s with the pitch, thrown with good life down in the zone and improved overall command, allowing him to miss bats. His secondary stuff still needs refinement, and he struggled at times with it after moving up to Double-A, but he can spin a very good curve, has added a slider and has continued to work on developing his changeup.Continued work on his offspeed stuff will help PERSON continue to climb the ORGANIZATION' ladder, but everything is pointing in the right direction. He looks like a future big league starter, and if his non-fastball offerings improve greatly at age 21 in 2018, he could develop into more of a frontline guy.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 28, 2017 - PERSON, Fla.Favorite MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION is a Miami commit who has earned a 2015 ORGANIZATION and a 2016 ORGANIZATION honor. He was invited to the 2016 ORGANIZATION where he had a successful showing that earned him a top 500 national rank. PERSON has a large, strong build. At the plate, he starts the bat with a medium draw and has an open stance, but he boasts fair power. He has a three-quarter arm slot and a compact arm on the mound. His fastball sits in the mid-to-high 80s and he has a 73-mph curveball that needs to be tightened.",0
"The PERSON brothers pitched PERSON (Tallahassee) to the GPE state 3-A championship in 2014, with PERSON spinning a shutout in the semifinals and PERSON pitching four scoreless innings to win the finale. PERSON signed for $1.1 million as a fourth-round pick that June, while PERSON would have gone in about the same area of the 2015 PERSON had he not been strongly committed to PERSON's stuff has backed up a bit, but he's still a projectable left-hander with the potential for three average pitches. His fastball ranged from 90-95 mph when he was in high school but now sits more at 88-91, though he throws it for strikes with armside run. He also has a downer curveball and a fading changeup, and any of his three offerings can be his best on a given night.Like most young pitchers, PERSON needs to add strength and gain more consistency with his secondary pitches and command. If he can do that, he can become a mid-rotation starter.",0
"Former-2020 prospect reclassfied into the 2019 class in mid-March after trasnferring to a GPE, ORGANIZATION high school. Big bat speed, raw power and foot speed, with scouts hanging 60 on four tools regularly. That said, scouts haven't been able to get many looks this spring, it was against poor competition and he wasn't focused on in his summer events. The tools are comparable to Rays ORGANIZATION, a former 1st rounder.",0
"GPE (GPE) features the best hitting prospect/pitching prospect duo in high school baseball. PERSON may have hit his way into the first round, while PERSON could go that early as well. He kicked off the summer showcase circuit last June with a strong two-inning outing as the first pitcher to take the mound at the ORGANIZATION, and he hasn't let up since.PERSON can work in the low 90s with heavy sink on his two-seam fastball and hit 96 mph with his four-seamer. He has advanced feel for a breaking ball, showing the ability to morph his sharp slider into a bigger-breaking curveball or a harder cutter. He also has a deceptive changeup with tumble that lacks consistency but also can be his best pitch at times.At 6-foot-5 and 220 pounds, PERSON has a frame built for durability and also the room to add some more strength. He's athletic and repeats his delivery well, allowing him to throw strikes. He's a tough competitor who can get overly animated on the mound, but the only real knock against him is that he may difficult to sign away from GPE.",0
"PERSON stood out last year while playing second base for PERSON but has really taken to shortstop this year as expected, with a scorching hot second half of the year, offensively and defensively.",1
"GPE and shoulder injuries limited PERSON to 16 at-bats in his first year at ORGANIZATION, but he returned with a vengeance in 2014. He took home Most Outstanding Player honors at the ORGANIZATION World Series as the ORGANIZATION won their first-ever championship, then became the top position prospect in the college class after a strong summer with the GPE collegiate national team. He's maintained that status this spring by proving he can handle shortstop after moving from second base to replace ORGANIZATION ninth-round pick PERSON. Most scouts believe he has the quickness and arm strength to stay at the position long-term, even though he hadn't played there since he was a GPE high schooler in 2012, when the ORGANIZATION drafted him in the 38th round. PERSON is a technically sound hitter who fits at the top of his lineup with his on-base ability and speed. While he's not a big home run threat, he can drive the ball into the gaps. His makeup is off the charts and universally praised by coaches and scouts.",1
"Signed for $350,000 as an 11th-rounder out of GPE (GPE) JC in 2011, PERSON led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with a 2.25 ERA when he made his full-season debut two years later. He blew out his elbow and missed 2014 following PERSON surgery, then returned last year to claim a spot on the 40-man roster with his live arm.PERSON throws harder than any pitcher in the ORGANIZATION' system, with his lively fastball sitting at 97-99 mph and repeatedly climbing into triple digits when he worked as a reliever in the ORGANIZATION during the offseason. His mid-80s slider also can be a weapon with bite when he stays on top of it. PERSON's changeup isn't nearly as effective because he throws it too hard and doesn't command it well.PERSON has had trouble repeating his mechanics, as his release point wanders and he doesn't always take a direct line to the plate. He had little track record of throwing strikes, but he's doing a better job in 2016 and enhancing his chances of remaining a starter. If PERSON shifts to the bullpen, he could ascend to GPE in a hurry.",0
"Pitching in GPE and the LOCATION Conference isn't an easy task, but PERSON has been doing it as a starter for three years. The tall right-hander was a first-team all-WAC performer as a sophomore, then used a strong performance in the ORGANIZATION to springboard to an even better junior year to put him firmly on the GPE radar.There's a lot to like with this GPE native's size and stuff. The 6-foot-4 righty has a fastball-curve combination that's attractive to many teams. He'll sit 92-94 mph with his fastball, and can touch 96 mph at times. He has a big 12-to-6 curve, thrown in the 76-80 mph range, that he uses effectively as his out pitch, and he mixes in a changeup. A big x-factor for ORGANIZATION might be his cutter-like slider, thrown in the upper-80s, that could develop into a much better pitch in the future. All of it comes from a catapult-like delivery with a lot of moving pieces. The positive of that is deception; the negative is spotty command, which gets away from him when he tries to go up and down in the zone or gets off to the side in his delivery.There's a split camp among scouts about PERSON's future role. With the potential for a four-pitch mix, a team taking him in the top three rounds is bound to let him head out as a starter, but knowing that his fastball-curve combination could tick up in shorter relief stints provides a nice backup plan.",0
" For much of his amateur career, PERSON intrigued with his plus arm strength, but had trouble always finding the strike zone. He made great strides in that regard during his junior year at ORGANIZATION, pitching himself into the first round and that continued for the most part during his first full season. He took his power repertoire to the ORGANIZATION organization when the ORGANIZATION sent him to ORGANIZATION for PERSON during the offseason. With his tall, slender frame, PERSON will run into delivery issues, and while that can lead to command problems, he threw strikes more often than not while pitching at two levels. His fastball has a ton of sink and generates groundballs aplenty and he complements it with a big slider that gets swings and misses. His sinking changeup has the chance to be more than usable. All that, if he can maintain his delivery and stay in the strike zone, adds up to the kind of frontline starter the ORGANIZATION haven't developed in quite some time.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",0
"The ORGANIZATION used two of their first three selections in the 2014 Draft on college players who had a chance to catch and bats that still would make them valuable if they can't: first-rounder PERSON and third-rounder PERSON. PERSON attracted most of the headlines and has a higher offensive ceiling. PERSON had a greater likelihood of staying behind the plate but wasn't fully committed to doing so, so he became a full-time outfielder in his first full year as a pro.PERSON already has the best plate discipline in the system, rarely gives away at-bats and walked as much as he struck out in his debut. He strokes line drives from gap to gap and should record high batting averages and on-base percentages while providing 10-15 homers per season. He has solid speed to go with basestealing aptitude.PERSON has the quickness, agility and enough pure arm strength to make it work as a backstop, but was raw as a receiver and had little success throwing out basestealers. He has the athleticism to play on the outfield corners, though moving there places more demands on his bat and could leave him buried at a position where GPE looks loaded.",1
"GPE is often a virtue, and that's certainly been the case with PERSON and the ORGANIZATION. The GPE Island-based high schooler was taken in the second round of the 2009 Draft but didn't throw a competitive pitch until 2012 following PERSON surgery and several subsequent issues. He brokeout in 2014 and kept it going in 2015, making his big league debut before a lat tear shut him down for a spell.PERSON is lean, lanky and loose, firing mid-90s fastballs with ease and having the ability to reach back for more when he needs it. He throws it with sink, not only missing bats, but also generating groundball outs. His changeup is his best secondary offering, which he turns over and sinks very well. His curveball has gotten better, a big breaking ball he can keep down in the zone and is now a Major League average pitch. He doesn't hurt himself with walks, and his overall command has improved over time. PERSON is looking more and more like a frontline starter, one who's ready to be a full-time part of the ORGANIZATION stable of young starters.",1
"PERSON spent 2018 at ORGANIZATION before he was effectively showcased in the ORGANIZATION. He has bat-missing, big league stuff, sitting 92-95 and touching 96 in multi-inning ORGANIZATION appearances, and sitting comfortably in the 95-96 range when he was asked to air it out for a single inning. PERSON also has elite breaking ball spin rates. His 12-6 curveball spins in excess of 3,000 rpm and his firm, upper-80s slider/cutter often approaches that mark, which is rare for a breaking ball that hard. He also has a unique delivery that disorients hitters, during which his arm wraps behind his lower back. His arm action is ugly but, short of a 7-day DL stint this year after he was hit with a comebacker, PERSON hasnât been hurt as a pro. 
His usage has been atypical, however. His starts were often spaced out by seven or eight days in 2018, and itâs unrealistic to expect him to have that kind of recovery time between turns on a big league pitching staff. If asked to throw every fifth day, his stuff may not be as nasty as it was this year. He projects as a No. 4 or 5 starter but may also be deployed in a multi-inning relief role.",0
"Acquired from PERSON as part of the return for PERSON, PERSON has advanced command of a four-pitch mix that enabled him to reach Double-A at age 19. He'll likely have a plus fastball and changeup at peak while his breaking balls are still works in progress. So too is PERSON's ability to handle a full-season workload. He's had some knee trouble and PERSON spaced out his starts pretty liberally late last year as a way to limit his inning. His 86 innings last year were a career high, so while PERSON is advanced from a stuff and pitchability standpoint, he likely won't reach PERSON and stay there until he's capable of handling more innings. He projects as an above-average big league starter with a bit more developmental distance to travel than you might think given his level.",0
"PERSON (along with PERSON) came back from GPE in the 2015 PERSON trade. He's always been on the starter/reliever bubble, in large part because his fastball doesn't play quite as well as its pure velocity would seem to indicate and because the lack of a truly average changeup forces PERSON to use his fastball very heavily. His stuff backed up just a tad last year. He should still be a no. 5 starter or middle reliever if it doesn't any more.",1
"Another in the long line of ORGANIZATION of GPE hitters with micro strikeout rates, PERSON'd just seven times during his entire junior season. He's carried that contact ability into pro ball, where he struck out just 8.5% of the time at Low-A in his first full season before moving on to Hi- and Double-A late in the year. 
We're skeptical of his ability to play shortstop due to below-average hands and actions, and think he probably fits best in center field due to his speed, but PERSON played him exclusively at short last year. The lack of power likely means he maxes out as a utility man, so it makes sense to hand Clement a ton of reps at shortstop to see if he can improve, since ideally he'd be able to play there on occasion. He spent a lot of time with the big league club during 2019 spring training and made characteristically high rates of contact. The bat and his speed should carry him to some kind of lesser major league role, with his defensive development determining if it's a super utility one or a limited runner/bench bat gig.",0
"A potential plus defender at short, PERSON had strong numbers in a hitter-friendly college environment at ORGANIZATION. He's very patient, almost excessively so. ",0
"PERSON had injury issues and moved back and forth from the rotation to the bullpen in college. In the 'pen, sits upper-90s with life and angle. Breaking stuff has nasty, vertical action.",0
"Signed in July 2012 out of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON spent his first three pro seasons in GPE ball before finally advancing to a full-season level for the first time in 2016. He scuffled a bit the following year, receiving a mid-season demotion from the Class A Advanced California League back to Class A PERSON, but rebounded with a breakout 2018 campaign in which he established career highs in most offensive categories. PERSON continued to perform well in the ORGANIZATION, and the A's added him to the 40-man roster after the season.PERSON makes a lot of contact from the left side of the plate, where he employs an open setup with a flat swing that enables him to spray the ball across the whole field. While it does limit his power potential, PERSON has a knack for finding the gaps and uses his plus speed to take extra bases when possible. That speed also makes PERSON a capable center fielder, and he has the requisite arm strength needed to play right field.With his left-handed bat, speed and defensive versatility, PERSON has the makings of becoming a future bench outfielder at the highest level. If he can make further strides as a hitter, and possibly add some power to his game, he could take on a greater role.",0
"GPE of the ORGANIZATION (GPE, Ala.) program that produced a pair of big leaguers in the ORGANIZATION brothers, PERSON turned down the ORGANIZATION as a 39th-round pick in 2013 to attend PERSON. He improved dramatically from season to season in college, and he snuck into PERSON A as the D-backs saw an up-the-middle player with a track record of performance in a Draft that was light on that demographic.PERSON ranked among the LOCATION batting leaders in his junior season, but some worry his hitting ability won't translate as well against pro pitching. His right-handed swing can get long, giving him trouble against quality fastballs in on his hands and against breaking pitches. He does have good bat speed and drove the ball more consistently this past college season, showing double-digit home run potential for the next level after going deep just once in each of his first two years at PERSON.PERSON's best tool is his plus speed, which he uses well in center field and is learning to incorporate on the bases. He showed a much better feel for stealing bags this spring, and while he has fringy arm strength, he makes accurate throws.",0
"Though he first became eligible to sign at age 16, PERSON didn't land a pro contract until he was nearly 21, turning pro for $50,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in February 2015. Raw on the mound despite his advanced age, he has yet to work 100 innings in a season and spent 2018 in high Class A as a 24-year-old. He impressed as a reliever in the ORGANIZATION after the season, so the ORGANIZATION decided to expedite him in that role.PERSON has an electric fastball with running life that parks at 95-98 mph and has reached 102 mph in shorter stints. In the ORGANIZATION, he worked on a two-seamer that sat in the mid-90s with some sink. His upper-80s slider is more notable for its velocity than its sharpness, while his changeup is often too firm to be effective.San PERSON had deployed PERSON as a starter because he needed innings to transition from thrower to pitcher, but scouts long have projected him to wind up in the bullpen. He looks more comfortable as a reliever with a simplified approach, doing a better job of keeping his delivery in sync and finding the strike zone. He could develop into a set-up man and perhaps even more if he can add significant polish.",0
"  ORGANIZATION, a ORGANIZATION commit, played well on the showcase circuit last summer and was the winning pitcher in the championship game of the ORGANIZATION World Championship in October. But it was his performance this spring in the ORGANIZATION high school ranks that sent him shooting up ORGANIZATION boards.ORGANIZATION has a powerful right arm and has touched 98 mph with his fastball this spring. He more typically works in the low to mid 90s but has room for additional strength gains in his lean frame. He has a pair of quality breaking balls, and his changeup has made strides to round out his full arsenal.Despite there being some effort in his delivery, ORGANIZATION generally works around the strike zone with all his pitches. He has a loose arm and good athleticism, which should help him clean up his delivery and pitch with better command as he gets more experience.",0
"PERSON lost most of 2015 and 2016 at ORGANIZATION after a line drive to the head left him with severe concussion symptoms, then bounced back to become the second pitcher in school history with a 100-strikeout season as a redshirt senior in 2018. The ORGANIZATION offered him a $5,000 bonus as a 32nd-round pick and he has made the most of that opportunity. He began this year in extended spring training but earned a promotion from low Class A reliever to high Class A starter in GPE, and he didn't permit an earned run in his first four starts afterward.PERSON's success hinges on a sinker that rivals PERSON's as the best in the system. He has sat at 92-93 mph and touched 95 with his two-seamer as a starter, and Class A hitters have struggled to lift it in the air. He throws his curveball and slider in the low 80s, and they're reliably average offerings when they don't blend together.He has some feel for a changeup as well, enhancing PERSON's chances of remaining a starter and becoming a back-of-the-rotation option. To do so, he'll have to upgrade his control and command. He lacks a wipeout offering but his sinker gives him a chance to join PERSON as the only ORGANIZATION products to reach the Majors.",0
"PERSON might have gone in the first two rounds of the 2017 ORGANIZATION had he been signable away from a ORGANIZATION commitment, and he should go in the same area this June as the best sophomore-eligible prospect at a four-year college. He's the fastest premium prospect in the college ranks and has the tools and upside to become the first Seahawk ever selected in the first round. He had helium as the ORGANIZATION approached, heating up down the stretch and winning the ORGANIZATION's player of the year and tournament ORGANIZATION awards.PERSON has true top-of-the-scale speed and basestealing acumen. He creates havoc when he gets on base and is doing a better job of doing so in 2019, making more consistent contact while posting one of the higher walk rates in ORGANIZATION Division I. A switch-hitter with some bat speed and strength, he shows average raw power from both sides of the plate during batting practice but has yet to translate it into home run production.Though PERSON has solid arm strength to go with his blazing speed, there's skepticism about his ability to remain at shortstop. He doesn't react as quickly as expected at short and doesn't throw well from different angles. Many scouts project him to wind up in center field, where his tools would fit well.",0
"Viewed as a low-ceiling pitchability arm in college, PERSON reached Double-A just one calendar year after he was drafted by PERSON, which traded him to GPE in the ORGANIZATION deal the following winter. Last year he experienced an uptick in velocity and his four-seamer now sits in the low-90s and touches 94. It helped PERSON miss more bats, and he struck out a batter per inning at ORGANIZATION. Realistically, PERSON will pitch at the back of a rotation as a No. 4 or 5 starter because nothing he throws is plus and it's hard to envision him striking out many major league hitters. But if the velo bump last year was just the start of a trend that continues into the future, there might be a bit more here.",1
"There are some red flags here, chief among them PERSON's reckless and epicurean approach at the plate. But he's remarkably talented, posessing elite bat control and an ability to lift the ball in the air with great regularity. PERSON is also a plus runner with a chance to be a plus defensive center fielder with a plus arm, so his bat has some room for regression after a breakout 2017. His scouting report reads much like PERSON' has for the last several years with a tick better tools across the board.",0
" The ORGANIZATION got the power lefty from the ORGANIZATION at the 2012 trade deadline for PERSON and they should be able to reap the benefits soon. PERSON has struck out close to 12 per nine innings over the course of his ORGANIZATION career, using a power two-pitch combination to go right after hitters and miss a lot of bats. His fastball can be plus, up to 95 mph with late life and sink. His hard slider gives him a second plus offering, a breaking ball with late bite that heâs not afraid to throw at any point. As his 56 saves attest, PERSON has been used to close games and assuming he can maintain his average command, thereâs no reason to think he canât serve the same role in the big leagues.",0
"PERSON has one of this class' most impressive physiques and some of its best present raw power. He projects to a corner outfield spot. Scouts have questions about PERSON' bat, citing swing length and feel for contact.",0
"Massive 6'8 righty has huge sink in the low-90's and a sharp breaker, posted insane groundball numbers during his junior spring.",0
" The ORGANIZATION teenager had a very successful GPE debut in 2012, pitching well in the rookie-level ORGANIZATION and earning a late promotion to finish the year in the ORGANIZATION. Heâs not the biggest guy in the world, but he has the makings of a good three-pitch mix that allowed him to strike out a batter per inning during his stateside debut. His fastball projects to be above-average and he could have two Major League average offerings in his slider and changeup. Heâs generally around the strike zone and didnât hurt himself with walks in his first step up the long organizational ladder.",0
"Since the ORGANIZATION took PERSON with the ORGANIZATION. 31 overall pick in the 2014 Draft, he's lived up to the ""have left arm, will travel"" axiom. PERSON sent him to the ORGANIZATION in the PERSON deal in July 2016. He spent the next two seasons working his way up to GPE, making his big league debut in '18, but was on the move again in ORGANIZATIONvember as part of the PERSON deal.PERSON has added some velocity since he entered pro ball and now features a fastball that he throws in the 92-97 mph range, and it has good run and sink to it at its best. The ORGANIZATION feel his slider is his best pitch, something that has become a true wipeout pitch, albeit not always consistently. He can miss bats with his changeup, but it's not as good as his fastball-slider combination. His command has come and gone, and he struggled finding the strike zone consistently in 2018, but most feel PERSON's athleticism should allow him to have average control.The left-hander isn't that big, but he still can create downhill plane, and he gets high marks for his competitiveness on the mound. With further refinement of his offspeed stuff and his control, he has all the tools to be a mid-rotation starter in the big leagues.",1
"PERSON improved his ORGANIZATION stock in 2016 as an GPE junior by hitting .360/.465/.646 with a career-best 10 home runs before the ORGANIZATION made him their second-round pick. After he continued to swing the bat well early in his first full season, the A's landed PERSON, left-hander PERSON and reliever PERSON in the July deal that sent PERSON and PERSON to ORGANIZATION posted a .380 average in 40 games while reaching Double-A after joining the A's system, and then he continued to elevate his stock in the ORGANIZATION, where he finished in the top three in the circuit in GPE, doubles, extra-base hits, runs scored, total bases, slugging and home runs. PERSON's right-handed swing is short and simple, but he also keeps his barrel in the hitting zone for an extended period of time and drives the ball across the whole field. He has above-average raw power and already knows how to get to it in games, a notion supported by his 16 home runs and 26 doubles across three levels in 2017. Some scouts still question how it will translate at higher levels because his game does have some swing-and-miss tendencies, albeit with sound overall plate discipline.PERSON is a fringe-average runner who shows good instincts on the bases and in the field. A shortstop in college, PERSON saw time there as well as third base prior to being dealt, but he handled the hot corner exclusively after joining the A's. He profiles as an average defender there, with soft hands, good range and a plus arm that produced 94 mph off the mound in college. Regardless of his position, PERSON has the hitting ability to profile as a big league regular.",0
" PERSON was among the players the ORGANIZATION considered selecting with the first overall pick in the 2013 Draft. They ultimately chose PERSON and PERSON landed with the ORGANIZATION at ORGANIZATION. 6 overall. A little more than a year later, the ORGANIZATION added PERSON as well, acquiring him from the ORGANIZATION as a part of the trade that sent PERSON to GPE. PERSON comes from a baseball family (his brother, PERSON, and his uncle, B.J. PERSON, have both played professionally) and he has a good understanding of the game. His advanced approach at the plate and ability to put the barrel on the ball translate into high batting averages. Though he has raw power, his swing consistently produces line drives than home runs.PERSON doesn't contribute a lot beyond his offensive production. His lack of speed limits him on the bases and restricts hisrange at third base. He does have sure hands and a solid arm at the hot corner.",1
"Signed for $70,000 out of GPE in 2011 by the ORGANIZATION, PERSON spent three years in GPE ball before making his GPE debut last season. He hit .319 to finish fourth in the high Class A GPE League batting race, appeared in the ORGANIZATION and joined the ORGANIZATION as the best of four prospects traded for PERSON in July. PERSON stands out more for his floor than his ceiling, as he's more steady than flashy but has no glaring weaknesses outside of his lack of power. He makes consistent line-drive contact, though he does it so easily that he doesn't draw a lot of walks and might not contribute much offensively beyond a high batting average.An average runner, PERSON isn't a threat to steal bases but ranges well to both sides at shortstop. He has sure hands and a solid, accurate arm.",1
"If PERSON had stayed healthy as a Duke junior, he could have been the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in the 2015 Draft. But he didn't, just like he couldn't in his first two college seasons, requiring PERSON surgery in April and dropping to the third round. He signed for $2 million and will make his pro debut in 2016.When he's free of physical issues, PERSON looks like a ORGANIZATION. 1 starter. He regularly delivers 93-97 mph fastballs and also gets swings and misses with his curveball and slider. He has feel for a changeup as well, giving hitters something else that they have to worry about.PERSON throws strikes with relative ease, and his 6-foot-7 frame creates difficult angle and plane on his pitches. But he'll have to prove that he can stay on the mound after working just 145 2/3 innings (including summer ball) in three years of college. Besides coming back from elbow reconstruction, he also has to deal with spondylolysis, a manageable defect of the vertebra in the lower back",0
"Signed for just south of $700,000 out of GPE, PERSON was a polished amateur arm who has been as advertised in two years of pro ball. He has good command of mostly average stuff as a 19-year-old, so there's a chance he either grows into better stuff through physical maturation, or develops such special command that he doesn't have to. In either case, he's got a shot to be a No. 4 or 5.",0
"Most of the top catching prospects in this year's Draft stand out more for their offensive prowess than their defensive ability, and PERSON is no exception. He's similar in that regard to fellow PERSON prep product PERSON, the D-backs' first-round pick in 2012, though PERSON has a better chance to remain behind the plate.PERSON has a quick swing with a lot of leverage, giving him above-average power. He performed well on the high school showcase circuit last summer, highlighted by winning the home run derby at the ORGANIZATION in June. The ORGANIZATION State recruit has a reliable approach and consistently makes hard contact.PERSON's plus arm is a definite asset behind the plate, though he needs to smooth out his transfer and accuracy. His receiving and blocking skills also will have to get better. He moves better than most catchers and should be able to transfer to an outfield corner if needed.",0
"After signing for $1.3 million as a fourth-round pick in 2012, PERSON developed more slowly than expected. He didn't reach full-season ball until 2014 and struggled when he got there, posting a 6.85 ERA in 11 starts in low Class A. This year he has looked more like the pitcher the ORGANIZATION thought they were signing, earning a promotion to high Class A after a month.PERSON has reclaimed the fastball velocity he displayed in high school, working at 92-93 mph and topping out at 96 repeatedly this year. His heater can be very tough to hit when he uses his 6-foot-6 frame to drive it down in the strike zone. His hard knuckle-curve can generate swings-and-misses as well.Though PERSON still has work to do with his changeup, it shows signs of becoming a usable third option. He's doing a better job of throwing strikes this year, which bodes well for his chances of remaining a starter at higher levels.",0
