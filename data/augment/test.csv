"There's been a seven-figure ORGANIZATION catcher near the top of every international class dating back through 2016, and ORGANIZATION is this year's model. He's a little less polished on defense than most of his predecessors but has a plus arm and mature, strength-driven power. He has everyday offensive ability if he can remain lithe and mobile enough to catch. ",0
"After appearing in 19 games but making only one start as a ORGANIZATION freshman in 2016, PERSON transferred to JC of ORGANIZATION and dominated as a starter, posting a 1.56 ERA with 118 strikeouts in 81 innings. The performance, along with a heavily scouted bullpen session in late May, during which he hit 102 mph, gave the right-hander some serious helium ahead of the 2017 Draft. The ORGANIZATION ended up selecting PERSON 28th overall with the second of their two first-round picks, then signed him for slightly above slot value at $2,452,900. PERSON continued to thrive in his pro debut, turning in a lights-out performance across two levels, though he's been plagued by injuries in 2018. A back injury delayed the start of PERSON's season until early May, and when he finally took the mound, the right-hander logged just 1 2/3 innings in the ORGANIZATION State League before being struck by a line drive that resulted in a fractured right forearm. PERSON's four-pitch mix is highlighted by the best fastball and slider in GPE's system. He was consistently up to 97-98 mph with his fastball during the spring and threw even harder in his pro debut, at times bumping triple digits, albeit in shorter stints. PERSON has already cleaned up his slider since signing and now throws it with more power and tilt in the upper 80s, giving him a legitimate put-away pitch to complement his explosive fastball. His changeup is currently ahead of his curveball, with the former grading out as an average pitch and the curve being more fringy. There's some concern regarding PERSON's durability because he had a screw put in his right elbow in high school, but the 6-foot-6 hurler was nothing but healthy and durable in junior college and during his debut. Provided he stays healthy, PERSON seems well on his way toward becoming a No. 3 starter, perhaps more if he can improve his secondaries and overall command.",0
"PERSON has diverse athletic bloodlines, as he's the grandson of former ORGANIZATION of the ORGANIZATION and also is related to former ORGANIZATION power forward PERSON and former ORGANIZATION quarterback PERSON. He reclassified to enter the Draft a year early in 2014, turning down the ORGANIZATION as a 23rd-rounder before signing with the ORGANIZATION for $550,000 as a 20th-rounder out of GPE (Fla.) JC the following June. He spent his first two pro seasons in GPE ball before hitting 15 homers in low Class A in 2017.A switch-hitter, PERSON has some of the best raw power in GPE's system and does more damage from the right side. He's strong and has plenty of bat speed, leverage and loft in his swing, but he will have to show he can make consistent contact in order to tap into his pop. PERSON made strides with his approach and discipline last year but has been overly aggressive in 2018.PERSON has to produce at the plate because he doesn't offer much value on the bases or in the field. He's a below-average runner and corner outfielder, though he does have some arm strength. He may be best suited for first base, which would put even more pressure on his bat.",0
" As one of the youngest regulars in the LOCATION League in 2012, PERSON more than held his own. He's an aggressive hitter with a slap line drive stroke. While he does have a knack for making contact, he does need to develop his approach and become more selective. That way he can get on base more and use his plus speed to greater effect. He can defend at shortstop, though he's inconsistent, making the flashy, above-average play, but making too many mistakes of concentration or trying to do too much. PERSON needs to put on weight and get stronger and the ORGANIZATION were encouraged that he had added some muscle during the offseason, something that will be essential if he's going to hold up over the rigors of a long full season.",0
"After a bonus-skimming scandal rocked the FACILITY' international scouting department in 2008, it didn't make a significant signing for five years. That drought ended when PERSON signed PERSON, ORGANIZATION's No. 2-rated prospect in the 2013-14 international signing period, for $1.6 million out of the ORGANIZATION. PERSON and hamate maladies limited him to a total of 91 games in his first two full pro seasons, but he finally started to hit as hoped when he stayed healthy in 2017.PERSON combines bat speed and strength with loft and leverage in his right-handed swing, giving him as much raw power as any FACILITY prospect. He hit just .225/.283/.356 with a 36 percent strikeout rate in his first three years a pro, when his stroke often got too long and too steep. Getting regular at-bats has helped him make adjustments this year, as he has started to recognize pitches better and become less pull-happy.PERSON's arm strength is just as jaw-dropping as his power, and those two tools make him an easy fit for the right-field profile. He's already starting to mature and could lose a step off his presently average speed once that process is complete. That shouldn't stop him from becoming an average defender, however.",0
"Acquired in the ORGANIZATION swap, the wispy PERSON has three average pitches that could continue to improve either through reps and improved feel (the changeup), or mature physicality (the fastball). His 11-7 curveball has good shape, depth, and bite, his delivery is graceful, smooth, and repeatable. Stagnant development likely leaves PERSON with a collection of 50-grade pitches and command, relegating him to the ORGANIZATION. 5 starter realm. But while you can quibble about which areas he's most likely to improve (at age 21, the body and velocity may be done growing), it seems likely that some of the stuff will due to the frame, delivery, and athleticism.",0
"GPE is the victim of big bonus expectations that eventually cratered when the available money was largely spent. He's expected to settle for a high six figure bonus with the ORGANIZATION and is a smaller righty with some effort to his delivery, but consistently shows three average or better pitches with good feel for his craft. There isn't much margin for error for him to turn into a league average starter, but he's by far the most advanced of any arm in this class and he's so young that he doesn't need physical projection to improve by a good bit.",0
"PERSON was so advanced as a prep star in GPE that scouts viewed him more like a college pitcher than one in high school. He lived up to that evaluation, racing to the ORGANIZATION in his first full professional season as a 19-year-old. But PERSON's progress hit a roadblock in 2013 when he underwent PERSON surgery in June. PERSON returned to action this year, and he looks to be on his way to recapturing his top-tier stuff. His fastball sits in the mid-to-upper 90s, and it has touched triple digits. PERSON's best secondary pitch as an amateur was his cutter, but the ORGANIZATION took it away to force him to improve his other offspeed offerings. PERSON's curveball and changeup have both improved, and they have plus potential. PERSON is an exceptional athlete and his work ethic and makeup are very well regarded. He profiles as a front-line starter if he can make a full recovery from surgery.",1
"GPE aggressively, PERSON reached the Class A Advanced California League in 2013 at age 19. The ORGANIZATION think he can develop into a top-of-the-order catalyst in the future.PERSON's best tool is his speed, and he has more than enough to be a threat on the basepaths and to give him range up the middle. The GPE switch-hitter's actions and his arm are good enough for shortstop, but he's also seen time at second base thus far in his pro career. PERSON has no power to speak of, relying on making contact and using his speed for his offense. Some added strength and improvement of his on-base skills will certainly help him down the road.If the bat can come along, PERSON has the chance to be an everyday shortstop, though a career as a speedy and dynamic utility type is nothing to sneeze at.",1
"Enamored with PERSON's triple-digit fastball, the ORGANIZATION gave the left-hander a $650,000 bonus -- more than $400,000 above the recommended slot value -- out of PERSON in the sixth round of the 2014 Draft. He showcased his big fastball the following year during stints in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn and GPE Atlantic Leagues, and then opened even more eyes with a strong ORGANIZATION performance. The results weren't quite there for PERSON in 2016, although it didn't keep him from reaching to Double-A in just his second full season. He's fared considerably better this season in his return to the level, where he's been deployed as a starter but also has been limited to no more than three innings per outing. PERSON's elite fastball gives him closer potential, as he'll routinely hit 100 mph (or higher) while sitting comfortably at 95-99. Beyond that, however, PERSON remains very raw. The ORGANIZATION have worked with PERSON to simplify his delivery, with the goal of improving his fastball control, though his struggles have continued in that regard. His slider has its moments, registering in the low 90s, and nets him whiffs, but overall is a below-average offering due to a lack of consistency. With his big fastball from the left side and knack for missing bats, PERSON's upside as late-inning reliever in undeniable. The ORGANIZATION will continue to develop him as a starter for the time being, though he's unlikely to stick in that role without making massive gains as a strike-thrower.",1
"PERSON entered the spring as a college performer primed to do well on GPE day, but an uneven junior season that saw him briefly lose his spot as the Friday night starter put his stock in question. He righted the ship a bit near the end of the spring, giving him a bit of an up arrow as the GPE approached.A three-year starter for GPE, PERSON has long concerned scouts with his low three-quarters arm slot. He was throwing from a higher slot in the fall and sinking the ball better while throwing his slider with more depth. Back down lower this spring, the fear was that plus his workload was wearing on him. He can still crank his fastball up to 94 mph and his slider will show good break and tilt at times. He will flash an average changeup as well.With a big, physical body that could add strength, PERSON generally stays around the strike zone. A team that feels some rest and adjusted mechanics is all he needs could find a steal by taking advantage of his up-and-down spring.",0
"GPE picks beyond the ORGANIZATION Round are not allowed to be traded, but international bonus pool slots can be, even once the signing period has begun. That's how PERSON, along with right-hander PERSON, came to the D-backs from the Phillies, as the latter traded up to pick up more money to spend on the international market.A non-drafted free agent out of PERSON and State (after first attending PERSON), PERSON got a shot to start in 2015 after pitching well in relief in the ORGANIZATION right after signing. The D-backs kept him in a rotation once they got him and he opened some more eyes there. The 6-foot-5 lefty has some definite arm strength, sitting 92-95 mph with his fastball. He'll mix in a slurvy breaking ball and a changeup, both of which show glimpses of being serviceable. More than anything, PERSON needs to refine his command, and there's hope his pitches will all get more consistent if he can find the strike zone more consistently.PERSON is definitely a diamond in the rough and a long way away from the big leagues, but with size, arm strength and a three-pitch mix, the D-backs see no reason why he can't keep working out of a rotation.",0
"GPE is an energetic, multi-positional speedster with an infectious style of play. He's an aggressive hitter who strikes out a ton, but he played everywhere but first base and catcher last year and could find a big league role as a versatile bench piece.",0
"An excellent athlete, PERSON was considered the top two-way player in the 2013 Draft class. In the end, however, scouts couldn't pass up his combination of size and stuff from the left side, and GPE selected him seventh overall as a pitcher.PERSON throws his fastball in the low 90s, and there is projection left in his lanky frame. He only began throwing a curveball a couple years ago, but it already shows the potential to be an above-average pitch. In the absence of a breaking ball, PERSON's changeup blossomed, and it has the potential to develop into a plus offering.Despite his height, PERSON's athleticism gives him a chance to learn how to repeat his delivery well enough to have solid command. Though he is further away than most of the ORGANIZATION's top pitching prospects, PERSON's ceiling might be the highest of all of them.",0
"Command-oriented pitchers can often dominate young, inexperienced hitters at the lower levels of the ORGANIZATION. The move to Double-A in 2015 was a stiff test for PERSON, though he made some good adjustments. Moving to hitter-friendly Las Vegas in 2016 proved another challenge for the right-hander, although it didn't keep him from making his big league debut in August en route to 10 appearances (three starts) with the ORGANIZATION. In February, the ORGANIZATION acquired PERSON in exchange for cash considerations.  PERSON has long been among the best control artists in the ORGANIZATION, with a career 1.5 BB/9 ratio in more than 795 innings. He's had success in the past with average stuff across the board -- though he can touch 94-95 mph with his fastball on occasion -- and shows a willingness to throw all of his pitches at any point in the count. PERSON's tendency to nibble at the zone rather than attack hitters has resulted in more hits allowed and fewer strikeouts as he's climbed the ladder, although it has come with a better ground-ball rate.  The key for PERSON's future will be the development of his breaking stuff. If he can sharpen that, he has the chance to carve out a role as a back-end starter in the big leagues.",1
"In the 2017-18 international period, the ORGANIZATION weren't allowed to spend more than $300,000 for any one prospect based on their aggressive spending the previous year, something they would eventually be heavily penalized for. They did, however, manage to sign 20 players for six-figure bonsues, including PERSON, a GPE defector who got $190K to sign and has the makings of an intriguing bullpen piece.PERSON has a classic two-pitch power mix that he's already showing can overpower professional hitters. The right-hander misses bats with both pitches, starting with a fastball he typically throws in the 94-97 mph range with good riding life to it. He complements it with a solid hard slider that can get slurvy at times.While he's never going to have pinpoint command, PERSON was doing a better job of finding the strike zone in his second season after an up-and-down debut in the GPE. If that trend continues, he could eventually develop into a setup-type short reliever at the back end of a big league bullpen.",0
" While there are many catching prospects who are offensive-first type backstops, GPE is the other way around. The GPE native gets raves reviews for his defensive toolset. He has a plus arm, one of the best among PERSON catchers, and gets rid of the ball quickly. His athleticism leads to excellent agility behind the plate, with an ability to sit and block pitches in the dirt. His bat is behind his glove, though he's shown glimpses of offensive ability as well. He has a line-drive swing with gap power. There might be more pop if he can refine his approach. That's been GPE's biggest shortcoming, a tendency to chase pitches. Still very young, GPE has the potential to develop into an everyday backstop, especially if the bat comes along.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"PERSON was a toolsy, volatile high school prospect who had strikeout issues against varsity pitching. The way his hands load and his stride have both changed since he's entered pro ball, which has improved his once putrid timing. There are still some bat-to-ball issues, but PERSON is trending up and has a shot to be a multi-positional infielder with power.",0
"PERSON put himself on the prospect map by leading the LOCATION with nine homers and 33 walks as a Sacred Heart sophomore in 2015, only to slump in the ORGANIZATION that summer and again as a junior. He fell to the 17th round of the 2016 Draft, signed for $80,000 and didn't do much in his pro debut. But he has opened eyes since with his power and patience, combining for 30 homers and 176 walks in his first two full seasons while reaching Double-A.PERSON has quick hands and a pull-heavy approach, giving him more pop than a typical 175-pounder. He's an extreme flyball hitter who makes a lot of loud contact from the right side of the plate, though the ORGANIZATION would like to see him cut down his swing and make more regular contact. He works deep counts and draws a lot of walks, giving him healthy on-base percentages despite subpar batting averages.With solid speed and an aggressive nature, PERSON can steal an occasional base. Some club officials believe he's the best defensive infielder in the system, and his quickness and arm strength allow him to play second and third base and serve in a utility role if needed. If he can put the bat on the ball more consistently, he could be an everyday shortstop in the mold of ORGANIZATION.",0
"A ninth-round pick in 2017 out of GPE Tech who tended to be a bit too hittable during his college career, PERSON had an up-and-down first full season of pro ball with the ORGANIZATION. While he finished second in the organization in strikeouts and capped off his year with a good start up a level in the ORGANIZATION State League playoffs, the left-hander gave up more hits (168) than innings pitched (154) in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON can be prone to creating his own big innings with one mistake. He often fought his delivery, causing his stuff to not be as sharp. That was particularly true of his breaking ball, which can get caught between a curve and a slider. He needs to rely on movement, deception and command because of his lack of plus stuff, starting with an 87-94 mph fastball that can sneak up on hitters due to his deception, but often lacks movement. He might need to pick one breaking ball to help define it better and give him a third solid pitch, behind his above-average changeup. He goes right after hitters and fills up the strike zone (2.0 BB/9 in 2018).PERSON finished off his first full season much more strongly than he started it. His ceiling might be limited, but if he can carry those adjustments over, he has the chance to be a No. 5 type starter or an effective middle reliever.",0
"At his peak, PERSON had mid-rotation stuff. He was sitting 94-97 at times during the spring of 2015, his changeup was plus, and his slurvy breaking ball was at least average. Since then his health and stuff have waxed and waned. In 2018, his stuff looked more like that of a fifth starter. Then he suffered a ORGANIZATION strain during 2019 spring training. He's now an oft-injured 24-year-old backend starter prospect who may benefit from a change of scenery.",1
"While the ORGANIZATION lost PERSON to free agency prior to the 2015 season, they did get the 34th overall pick in that year's Draft as compensation. That turned out to be PERSON, who has shown that his power output at ORGANIZATION was not an aberration, with big home run totals in each of his first two full seasons. PERSON has legitimate pop to all fields thanks to a very quick bat. While there is some swing and miss to his game, he has worked hard at shortening his swing and developing a better plan at the plate. He has shown some ability to draw walks, helping somewhat to offset the strikeout rate. His bat will have to be his carrying card because he is a below-average defender in left field. He has limited speed and a below-average arm, but the ORGANIZATION feel he'll eventually be adequate out there. The ORGANIZATION will live with fringy defense as PERSON continues to show he can punish the baseball at the upper levels of the system. If he continues to develop, he could be a left-handed-hitting middle-of-the-order run producer in the near future.",0
"PERSON couldn't crack PERSON A&M's staff as a freshman, appearing just four times all season, but he earned the closer's role and held onto it as a sophomore and junior, saving 16 games combined. That landed him in the fifth round, where the ORGANIZATION gave him full pick value as a college reliever who could be quick to the big leagues.PERSON has done nothing but pitch out of a bullpen, and he'll continue to do so, but he actually has a starting pitcher's repertoire. He'll work with a 93-96 mph fastball in shorter stints, and he backs that up with a changeup that he throws with good deception and that has splitter action to it. PERSON has thrown both a true slider and more of a hybrid breaking ball, and both have been average pitches. Not the biggest guy in the world, there was some concern about his longer arm action, but he has never been hit well.He might not be future big league closer material, but his stuff combined with his ability to throw strikes could allow him to move quickly and settle in as a Major League setup man down the road.",0
"PERSON is a flashy shortstop defender with good bat speed. As is typical for switch-hitters this age, both swings are in need of polish. Projections on the bat vary. PERSON is committed to PERSON, where his father coaches. He's rumored to be a target of GPE, GPE, and PERSON in the late first and comp round.",0
"PERSON threw a shutout to win the title game of the heavily scouted 2015 World Wood Bat Association World Championship showcase, but his polish stood out more than his stuff. That contributed to him going undrafted the following June, as did his commitment to GPE. He still fits the same profile in 2019, but three years of success as a member of a weekend rotation in the LOCATION should get him picked in the first four or five rounds.PERSON lacks a true plus pitch, but he has several effective offerings and there's no clear consensus as to which is his best. Though his fastball velocity is nothing special at 88-91 mph and a peak of 93, his heater plays up because he sinks and commands it so well, and it works well in concert with his changeup that features similar movement. He has improved his curveball this year, and both it and his slider/cutter can be solid pitches.Without overpowering stuff, PERSON has little margin for error and thrives by limiting his mistakes. He has tremendous feel for locating, manipulating and sequencing his pitches, and he tossed complete-game shutouts against two of the ORGANIZATION's better clubs (ORGANIZATION and GPE) this spring. He tunnels his offerings well, adding to his deception and his chances of becoming a No. 4 or 5 starter.",0
"PERSON PERSON in northern GPE has had four players drafted over the years, but none since 1999. Thanks to his solid all-round skills as a catcher, ORGANIZATION will undoubtedly be the first PERSON product to be selected this century, possibly in the top three rounds.None of ORGANIZATION's tools jump out as plus, but the sum of all of his parts make him an intriguing catching prospect. He has a solid hit tool, making consistent hard contact. There's some power in his right-handed swing, with a bit more to come as he physically matures. ORGANIZATION is a capable defender, with average receiving tools. Grades on his arm have varied this spring, but it has turned out he's been catching with some arm problems for much of this year, leading many scouts to think his arm is a tick above-average when healthy.While ORGANIZATION isn't the kind of GPE prospect who wows you, he also doesn't have any glaring holes. Solid all-around backstops are hard to find, and the dearth of them in the GPE class should help this GPE commit's stock in June.",0
"Â By reaching Double-A Bowie in his first full professional season, PERSON put himself on the fast track. He returned there in 2013 and led the LOCATION with a 3.26 ERA. PERSON hasn't repeated that level of success this season with Triple-A Norfolk.PERSON's fastball sits in the low-90s, and it can touch 95 mph. He throws from a steep downhill angle and uses his fastball's heavy sink to generate ground-ball outs. None of PERSON's offspeed pitches truly stand out, but he adds to their deception by throwing them all from the same arm slot. Though he fills up the zone, PERSON has more control than pinpoint command.Some scouts think PERSON's stuff would play up in the bullpen. But his build suggests a workhorse starter, and GPE believes he can fill that role in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON pumped his fastball up to 97 mph as a GPE high school senior in 2016, but concerns about his delivery, wildness and signability left him undrafted. He continued to show velocity but had difficulty finding the strike zone in his first two years at ORGANIZATION, pitching just eight innings as a sophomore last spring. After shortening his arm angle and raising his slot a bit in 2019, he has thrown consistently harder than any college pitcher available in the Draft.PERSON has sat at 95-97 mph and hit 101 with his fastball multiple times as a junior. His heater not only features premium velocity but also high spin rates, giving it riding action up in the strike zone. His slider has more power than bite, reaching the upper 80s and showing flashes of becoming a plus pitch at times yet also playing as a below-average slurve in the low 80s at others.A pure reliever, PERSON doesn't have a third pitch, still has effort in his delivery and still battles the strike zone on a regular basis. He has potential as a closer if he can develop a more reliable slider and cut down his walks. If not, his upside would be along the lines of PERSON.",0
"Though GPE weighed 160 pounds and had a mid-80s fastball as a high school senior in 2013, GPE area scout PERSON liked his loose arm and signed him for $32,000 as a 30th-rounder. He advanced slowly until breaking out in 2016, when he topped low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION relievers in strikeout rate (12.8 per nine innings) and opponent average (.198) and was no less effective when he transitioned to the rotation in late July. He was on his way to establishing himself as the system's best pitching prospect until he hurt his elbow and needed PERSON surgery after three dominant outings in high Class A last year. GPE returned to the mound this June after a 14-month layoff and showed that he can still overmatch left-handers and tie up right-handers with his plus downer curveball. He also misses bats and elicits weak contact with a low-90s fastball that peaks at 96 mph and gets on hitters quick. His changeup needs more work than his other two offerings but his willingness to use it bodes well for its development.A bit small for a starter, GPE compensates with athleticism and a quick arm. His control and command were unreliable early in his career but he began to make significant progress in the last two years before he got hurt. If he can't last in the rotation, he could have a future as a seventh-inning reliever who wouldn't be limited to being a lefty specialist.",0
"PERSON helped key PERSON's run to its first PERSON Series title when he moved from closer to starter last April, not allowing a run in his first 29 2/3 innings in his new role. He has excelled again in 2015, as he was college baseball's hottest pitcher down the stretch and the LOCATION pitcher of the year.PERSON has an electric arm that delivers 93-97-mph fastballs and power breaking balls. His changeup is an effective third pitch and coaches and scouts alike rave about his competitive makeup. Some scouts think he'd be best off channeling his energy into becoming a closer because he lacks size, his delivery features effort and his control can get wobbly at times.A 15th-round pick by the ORGANIZATION from a GPE high school in 2012, PERSON would have gone in the top five rounds had he been signable. Now he's one of three Commodores who figure to go early in the first round in 2015, joining PERSON and PERSON.",1
"Signed in November 2013, PERSON spent his first pro season in the ORGANIZATION before impressing during his brief GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION native graduated to full-season ball in 2016, earning mid-season All-Star honors in the Class A ORGANIZATION at age 19, though he did wear down physically late in the season. He continued to climb the ladder in 2017, beginning the season in the ORGANIZATION State League before moving up to Double-A at the midseason mark. PERSON's live arm generates easy velocity in a fastball that consistently sits between 92-95 mph with late life. His slider registers in the mid- to high-80s, thrown with late, short slicing action, and he also has the makings of an advanced changeup that he's already comfortable deploying against right-handed hitters. He's adept at changing hitters eye levels from an over-the-top release point, though some scouts worry about PERSON's ability to create favorable downhill plane given his height.PERSON should be able to tack on strength to his wiry frame as he matures physically, and in turn it should improve his durability. He has the arsenal and control profile to develop into a big league starter, although his fastball-slider pairing also give him a bright future as a reliever, one who can get outs on both sides of the plate.",1
"PERSON may have come off the board earlier in the 2014 Draft if not for a bout of forearm tightness that sidelined him for three weeks as a high school senior. The ORGANIZATION were thrilled to find him still available with the 30th-overall pick, and then signed him for $1.75 million. PERSON rewarded the ORGANIZATION by dominating in his first two pro seasons and then reached Double-A at age 20 in 2016. However, it will now be up to the ORGANIZATION to further his development after they acquired PERSON and PERSON in the ORGANIZATION Lucroy-Jeremy Jeffress Trade Deadline blockbuster.PERSON combines stuff and feel better than most young pitchers. His strong build allows him to maintain his 92-97 mph fastball deep into ballgames, and his low-80s slider gives him a plus second pitch. PERSON threw his changeup sparingly as an amateur, but has developed it enough as a pro to where scouts view it as a potentially average pitch. Meanwhile, a clean and repeatable delivery has helped to make PERSON an accomplished strike-thrower early in his career.Much like GPE, PERSON impressed last summer in his brief ORGANIZATION debut, and he continued to do so in 2017, his first full year with the organization. He lacks projection in his physical 6-foot-3 frame and needs to stay healthy, but PERSON has both the stuff and command profile to develop into a No. 2 starter.",1
"PERSON's athleticism has been the key to his success an amateur and the belief is that his natural abilities will help propel him through the ORGANIZATION and ultimately to the big leagues. After targeting lean, athletic, middle-of-the-field players in recent international classes, the ORGANIZATION continued down that path in 2019 with PERSON, whom they signed for $2.1 million out of the ORGANIZATION at the outset of the July 2 period.The tall and large-framed teen already shows advanced hitting skills and knowledge of the strike zone, and it's easy to envision him filling out nicely into his highly projectable frame. He makes solid contact from the right side of the plate and is known for hitting line drives to all fields. He has shown flashes of emerging power and projects to be an average hitter.What's certain is that PERSON is true centerfielder and has the skill set to stay at the position as he grows and develops. He projects to be a plus runner and that skill will help make him into an above-average defender.",0
"PERSON showed well in GPE's rotation as a sophomore but was unable to make progress the next year, spending much of the season in the bullpen with underwhelming results. The ORGANIZATION selected him in the 23rd round that June, and he pitched at both Class A levels during his full-season debut before advancing to Double-A in 2016 and making his big league debut early in the '17 season.A physically strong right-hander, PERSON pitches with a plus fastball that sits 94-96 mph and touches 97 with late sinking action that has resulted in strong ground-ball rates throughout his career. His low-80s slider plays well against right-handed hitters thanks to its depth and tilt, at times flashing above average, though his overall consistency with the pitch leaves much to be desired. PERSON holds his own against lefties in spite of his lack of a changeup, but he may need to add the pitch to his arsenal in order to retire them at the highest level.PERSON has the ability to work more than one inning, which he did in 23 of his 48 appearances (including four starts) in 2016. That stamina could make him a long reliever in the big leagues, though he does have the potential for a greater role if he can improve his slider and fastball command.",0
"The son of former big league pitcher PERSON and brother of the ORGANIZATION' PERSON, PERSON has moved slowly and steadily, one level at a time, up the ORGANIZATION' organizational ladder ever since he was taken as the ORGANIZATION. 5 overall pick in the 2014 Draft. His move to the upper levels of the system in 2017 was largely a successful one, including a ORGANIZATION invite and LOCATION All-Star nod, though he did struggle in the second half of the season.Gordon is the type of player who may not jump off the page with any one tool, but does a number of things well. He's typically employed a successful contact-oriented, line-drive approach from the left side of the plate. He did show more extra-base power in Double-A, but with that came a higher strikeout rate, though an increased walk rate offset that to a degree. He's a solid runner with good instincts and will steal a base on occasion, and is a tick above-average defensively, both in terms of his arm and overall actions at shortstop. Many have felt his range points to being a better fit at second base and while he did still primarily play short, he did see more time on the right side of the infield in 2017.Gordon will be 22 for all of the 2018 season and is knocking on the big league door. He's more of a high floor than ceiling type and isn't far away from showing just what kind of solid everyday big leaguer he can be, on either side of second base.",0
"A fifth-round pick out of GPE in 2012, PERSON had what was supposed to be his first full season all but wiped out by PERSON surgery. He returned to action in 2014 with PERSON, where he earned All-Star honors in the LOCATION, and he was named as a ORGANIZATION All-Star in '15 with PERSON. Though he didn't fare as well with the move to Double-A in 2016, a late-season injury to PERSON enabled PERSON to make his big league debut on Oct. 2.PERSON is an advanced receiver who can frame, and he's long received praise for his ability to handle a pitching staff. His arm is plenty strong -- even after PERSON surgery -- and consistently plays up thanks to his quiet footwork, clean transfer and quick release. As a right-handed hitter with good contact skills, PERSON is at his best when he employs an up-the-middle approach, though it does detract from his power potential. He hasn't hit for much of an average as he's climbed the ladder, but he has retained a strong approach and continues to get on base at a solid clip.PERSON profiles as a defensive-minded backup at the highest level, though concerns do remain about his overall hitting ability.",0
"While he lacks a standout tool, PERSON has a well-rounded skillset and might be able to tap into more power if he starts using his lower half more efficiently in pro ball. He projects, defensively, to right field.",0
"The ORGANIZATION didn't have a first-round pick in 2016 after signing PERSON, but felt fortunate when PERSON, perceived by many to be a first-round talent, fell to them in the second round and the 59th overall pick of the GPE. After three years of producing at ORGANIZATION, he's continued to do so as a pro, bringing a career .312/.363/.469 line with him to the ORGANIZATION courtesy of the PERSON trade. He was a week into his ORGANIZATION organization debut with Double-A Altoona when a broken hamate shelved him for an extended period.While none of PERSON' tools jump off the page, he does a lot of things fairly well. He's a switch-hitter who has shown he can hit for average from both sides of the plate and did so for all of his first full season following a rough April. He can drive the ball and there could be more over-the-fence pop if he can continue to make adjustments and refine his approach. There is some swing-and-miss to his game that concerns some, but he did cut his strikeout rate in the second half of 2017. PERSON has played all three outfield positions during his pro career and has enough speed to stay there should the ORGANIZATION want him to. He's probably a better defender in a corner, but profiles as a solid big league regular when all is said and done.",1
"GPE hasn't produced a first-rounder since the ORGANIZATION made PERSON the fourth overall choice in 2006. PERSON entered 2015 with a chance to end that drought because he had the stuff and physicality to become one of the first college pitchers taken, but he went down in mid-March with a shoulder impingement and never returned to the mound.Scouts liked the way PERSON pitched off his 89-94 mph sinker with the GPE collegiate national team last summer. At times he'll hit 97 mph with his heater and back it up with a plus slider and solid changeup, though not on a consistent basis. His stuff was down this year before he was sidelined.A 21st-round pick by the ORGANIZATION as a GPE high schooler in 2012, PERSON has a classic starter's build at 6-foot-5 and 220 pounds. He throws strikes but needs better command in order to miss as many bats as his stuff indicates he should.",0
"PERSON initially impressed scouts on the showcase circuit as a left-hander with impressive movement on three potential above-average pitches. He continued to pitch well this spring, and he ultimately became the highest drafted high school player from GPE when the ORGANIZATION selected him 12th overall in June.PERSON' fastball has hit 95 mph, but he more typically throws it around 90-91. He doesn't need big velocity to miss bats, however, as his low arm slot produces tremendous run and sink on his heater.PERSON' upper-70s slider has so much lateral break that at times he struggles to keep it in the strike zone, and his changeup dives at the plate. PERSON' small stature and unconventional delivery lead to concerns about his long-term viability in the rotation, though his athleticism gives him a real chance to make it as a starter.",0
"â¢ 7/19: PERSON reinstated from ORGANIZATION shoulder injury that kept him out for his entire sophomore season at ORGANIZATION hurt PERSON's stock leading into the 2016 Draft despite a healthy junior campaign. Those concerns weren't assuaged when he threw just one inning in his pro debut due to elbow soreness, but he took a huge step toward erasing doubts with a dominant and healthy first full season that saw him lead the Minors in GPE (1.39) while pitching across two levels and attending the ORGANIZATION. He was shelved for an extended period in 2018 with right biceps tendinitis that limited him to just 67 innings in Double-A, but made up for lost time with an impressive performance in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON made his big league debut early in the 2019 season, tossing three scoreless innings out of the bullpen to record a save. PERSON's fastball usually sits in the 93-95 mph range, but he can reach back for more when needed. He throws it with sink and run, making him effective both at getting ground-ball outs and missing bats. His slider is at least above average and represents his best secondary offering, thrown with power, at 85-87 mph, and late biting action that nets him whiffs and is especially lethal against righties. He also throws an effective curveball in the low 80s and has feel for a mid-80s changeup, though he'll need to refine the latter to neutralize left-handed hitters. He's around the strike zone with his entire four-pitch mix.The strong and athletic PERSON has helped remake his delivery with remarkable success, but concerns likely will persist on account of his arm action and low three-quarters slot. If he can stay healthy, PERSON's combination of athleticism, stuff and command point to a ceiling of a mid-rotation starter.",0
"PERSON was just a sophomore when the ORGANIZATION took three ORGANIZATION (left-hander PERSON, catcher PERSON and third baseman PERSON) in the first seven rounds of the 2011 Draft. But the ORGANIZATION went back to the well the next year, selecting PERSON in the fifth round. While a midseason promotion to Double-A PERSON reunited him with PERSON and GPE, PERSON has already passed them as a prospect. He has a quick, compact swing that allows him to catch up to any fastball. His slight frame doesn't produce much power, however. Defensively, PERSON has soft hands and a good arm. He has quieted some of the concerns about his range, though he still might end up at second base or as a utility infielder. PERSON earns high marks for his confidence and work ethic.",1
"PERSON was part of the ORGANIZATION trade and he's spent time in Double-A every year since 2016. He has standard 40 FV, middle relief stuff, but he's 28 and has a long injury history.",0
"A cousin of PERSON, PERSON has drawn comparisons to GPE, PERSON and PERSON since the ORGANIZATION made him the 28th overall pick in the 2009 Draft. PERSON used him as part of a four-player package to pry PERSON from GPE in December 2010, and PERSON appeared in the ORGANIZATION and made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in 2013. The ORGANIZATION' new front-office regime opted not to protect him on their 40-man roster this offseason, instead trading him to the ORGANIZATION for left-hander PERSON Bartsch.While PERSON' well above-average speed has helped him hit for average and steal bases throughout his pro career. He uses the entire field and will work some walks, but he strikes out too much for someone who doesn't drive the ball. Some scouts worry that his lack of strength will allow big league pitchers to simply overpower him.PERSON is a quality defender in center field, covering plenty of ground from gap to gap. His fringy arm isn't a huge liability but isn't conducive to filling in as a right fielder. He has turned out to be more like PERSON than PERSON or ORGANIZATION, and projects more as a fourth outfielder than an everyday player.",1
"After a somewhat lackluster first full year in 2011, where he finished with a 4.11 ORGANIZATION in the LOCATION, it may have been surprising to some that PERSON was double-jumped to Double-A to start the 2012 season. He rose to the challenge, finishing second in the organization in batting average against, third in strikeouts and fifth in ORGANIZATION. He has pretty good stuff from the left side with a fastball that touches 93 mph. It has good sink to it, eliciting many groundball outs. He has a curve and a slider and can vary them well. He maintains good arm speed on his changeup, giving him the chance for a four-pitch mix. He'll need to cut down on his walks, but he's not far from being ready to help out the big league rotation.",0
"It's not uncommon for a team to draft a college reliever and give him a chance to start. It becomes unusual when that pitcher goes out and finishes in the top 10 in ORGANIZATION in each of his first three full pro seasons, as PERSON did in 2013-15 before being dealt to GPE in January 2016. PERSON made his ORGANIZATION debut in a spot start for PERSON at the end of May and then made two more starts at the end of the season. He's found success pitching off of his low-90s, heavy, sinking fastball. Using that closer mentality from his days at ORGANIZATION, he goes right after hitters, inducing weak contact early in counts. His slider is a solid average hard breaking ball with bite that misses bats. While his changeup isn't quite as good, it is effective at neutralizing left-handed hitters. His walk rate has gone down each year since his summer debut and he continues to get a good amount of groundball outs.His brief big league debut was just a taste, with PERSON very close to being ready to fulfill a ceiling as a mid-to-back of the rotation type of starter at the highest level.",1
" PERSON made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in 2013, building off his solid 2012 season that saw him nearly win the LOCATION batting title. PERSON understands what his game is -- making consistent contact, spraying line drives with a little gap power, while using his speed to make things happen. He has very good speed, and his instincts on the basepaths make him even better. That speed works well in the outfield, where he's capable of playing all three spots well. His lack of power may mean he's never going to be an everyday corner outfielder, but a career as a top-of-the-order catalyst in center or as a valuable fourth outfielder seems a distinct possibility.",1
"PERSON displayed a 92-96 mph fastball as a reliever at ORGANIZATION, but his elbow often bothered him after he pitched. He preferred playing on an everyday basis anyway, and showed enough promise as a middle infielder to get drafted in the seventh round last June. His .388 batting average would have led the Rookie-level PERSON if he hadn't been promoted to high Class A and fell a few plate appearances short of qualifying.The ORGANIZATION already consider PERSON one of the more advanced hitters in their system. He handles the bat and controls the strike zone better than most of their prospects. He's an average runner with no more than gap power, so most of his offensive value comes from his ability to get on base.PERSON played some shortstop in his pro debut, but his arm doesn't respond well to longer throws, so he's better suited for second base. A reliable defender with sure hands, he excels at turning the double play.",0
"PERSON entered the spring with the potential to be one of the top college arms in the 2013 Draft class. Some inconsistent performances hurt his stock a bit, but the ORGANIZATION, known for liking big arms, couldn't let this GPE right-hander's pure stuff get by them in the first round. PERSON's fastball is a plus pitch, one that can touch 96 mph. He complements it with a very good hard breaking ball. PERSON and with a good delivery, PERSON ran into trouble with command and the fact that everything he threw was hard. His ability to change speeds effectively will be a key to his future as a starting pitcher.",0
"GPE's Saturday starter, behind PERSON, PERSON fits the mold of the college lefty, one who has average stuff but with some knowledge of pitching.PERSON's fastball will touch 91 mph, though there is some room for growth in his frame, meaning he could gain a tick or two with some maturity. His curve has been inconsistent but has the potential to be an average breaking ball. He doesn't throw his changeup enough, and it will have to improve as he moves to the next level.Generally around the plate, if PERSON can develop three average pitches, he has the chance to be a big league starter in the future.",0
"Everything you say about PERSON, you can say about PERSON, except for one thing: his size. PERSON doesn't ""look the part"" quite as much, but he still has just as many tools as his fellow GPE prepster. A right-handed hitter, PERSON ran a 6.6 second 60 at the LOCATION Pro Showcase over the summer. He also might have a more advanced bat than most of the high schoolers in the class, with a quick, short stroke that generates more power than you might expect given his frame. The lack of physicality might concern some, but his collection of tools should keep him high on GPE boards all spring.Like PERSON, PERSON made the rounds this past summer and played well. That continued into the spring, including a two-homer game when he faced off against his GPE contemporary. PERSON might have the higher upside, but some scouts said watching PERSON was like evaluating a college hitter because of his ""now"" tools.",1
"PERSON's ability to hit was brought into question by amateur scouts, but he's already hit his way to Hi-A at age 19 and hasn't slowed down. PERSON's arm strength has come and gone throughout his last two years of baseball but he's still running well enough to play center field so there's no need to decide between left and right as a defensive home right now. He reminds many of PERSON and PERSON.",0
"Thompson-Williams played for two years at FACILITY CC before transferring in 2016 to GPE and becoming the ORGANIZATION' fifth-round pick that June. After a nondescript pro debut that continued throughout his first full season, Thompson-Williams was one of six Minor Leaguers to record at least 20 homers and 20 stolen bases during a breakout 2018 campaign, much of which he spent in the ORGANIZATION State League before receiving a late promotion to Double-A for the LOCATION playoffs. The ORGANIZATION took note of the performance, and ultimately acquired him, along with PERSON and PERSON, from the ORGANIZATION in the PERSON deal in November.Thompson-Williams has an intriguing blend of tools, most notable among them the power-speed combo that netted him the 22 homers and 20 steals that ranked first and third, respectively, among ORGANIZATION farmhands. He drives the ball to the big parts of the field, showing above-average power from the left side of the plate, though questions remain about his ability to make consistent contact and hit for average against advanced pitching.Above-average speed helps Thompson-Williams to make an impact on the basepaths as well as in center field, where scouts consider him to be an above-average defender with an average arm, one capable of playing all three outfield positions. The potential exists for Thompson-Williams to develop into an everyday player, though a fourth or fifth outfielder role is more realistic.",0
"PERSON was a new name to most scouts last summer when he starred as the sparkplug for collegiate PERSON, playing center field and batting atop the lineup along with FACILITY 2018 first round second baseman PERSON. PERSON showed bat control and gap power, and was a fringe first rounder for many off that first, extended look on PERSON, but he came out this spring looking like a different player. He had become more physical and changed his swing to incorporate his added strength, lifting the ball and evolving from a gap-to-gap speed player into a potential monster with plus raw power, arm strength and speed. 
PERSON didn't put up the gaudy numbers you'd expect for a guy with top level tools in a mid-major conference who had also hit with wood on the GPE, and it was because his new swing would get out of whack. His weight transfer was too aggressive at times, causing him to lose balance and be in a poor position to hit offspeed stuff. PERSON's developmental issue is dialing in his swing mechanics and approach to something that best takes advantage of his explosive tools, which could be a multi-year process.",0
"The GPE signed PERSON out of the ORGANIZATION in 2012, and then sent him stateside for his pro debut the following year. He's continued to progress in the face of aggressive assignments and has held his own as one of the youngest players at each level to begin his career. PERSON moved up to the full-season ORGANIZATION last year and made developmental strides on both sides of the ball as PERSON's everyday catcher. He returned to PERSON this season to hit .347 over 60 games and received a promotion to Class A Advanced Lynchburg in late June. The switch-hitting PERSON knows how to handle the bat. He has natural hitting ability from both sides of the plate and makes hard contact consistently, while his combination of physical strength and bat speed produces good raw power. PERSON began to tap into that raw frequently last year in the ORGANIZATION, and he's continued to make strides in that department in 2016.PERSON continues to develop behind the plate, where he projects to be at least an average defender. His well above-average arm strength is his best tool and helped him throw out 31 percent of would-be basestealers in 2015, and he improved upon that mark by posting a 44-percent caught-stealing rate this season in his return to PERSON. And while he's improved as a blocker and game-caller as a result of handling advanced pitching staffs, the 20-year-old still has significant gains to make as a receiver. With undeniable upside, PERSON has all the ingredients to develop into an everyday catcher in the big leagues.",1
"PERSON surged from two homers as a ORGANIZATION sophomore to 18 (fourth in ORGANIZATION Division I) as a junior in 2015, spurring the ORGANIZATION to select him in the sixth round. He has been one of the system's most productive hitters ever since, slamming 61 homers in his first three full seasons despite missing two months in 2018 with an oblique injury. He stood out with a huge spring in big league camp in 2018, but that still couldn't change the fact that he's blocked in GPE with PERSON and PERSON at his two best positions.Thanks to his strength and solid bat speed, PERSON provides left-handed power to all fields and does damage against both southpaws and right-handers. Though he's extremely aggressive and his strikeout rate rose from 21 percent in 2017 to 32 percent last year when he tried to do too much to make up for lost time, his hand-eye coordination generally allows him to make repeated hard contact. He never has walked much but is capable of batting .250 with 25 homers if he gets regular at-bats in the big leagues.Though PERSON works hard to maintain his conditioning, his lack of speed and quickness limit his value on the bases and in the field. He has spent the majority of his pro career at third base and has enough arm strength for the position, but he has limited range and has been prone to errors there. His best position is first base and he can play an adequate left field but doesn't cover much ground.",0
"It's possible PERSON would have been PERSON's best everyday option at catcher toward the end of last year, but a desperate need for pitching depth facilitated his trade to PERSON for PERSON. PERSON is an athletic catcher with a plus arm, average receiving skills, and some feel to hit. After struggling to perform with the bat during the first several years of his career, PERSON has two straight season of league-average offensive performance at ORGANIZATION and Triple-A. He has a pull-and-lift style of hitting, but not enough raw power to optimize that kind of approach. He's a safe bet to be a quality backup and has a non-zero chance to hit a little more than we expect and be a low-end regular.",0
"The Rule 5 Draft is all about finding a diamond in the rough. That's particularly true in the case of GPE, who was initially a second-round pick by the Twins in 2014 after a tremendous career as PERSON's closer. He's had trouble staying healthy, however, missing nearly all of 2016 with an elbow bone bruise and then needing PERSON surgery in May of 2017. The ORGANIZATION thought his arm strength was worth the gamble, sending international bonus money to get him from the ORGANIZATION, who took him third in December's Rule 5.GPE rehabbed from surgery and was back on the mound in GPE, with the ORGANIZATION hopeful he can rediscover the nasty power stuff that made him look like a future closer. His fastball sits easily in the upper 90s and has hit triple digits. He backs that up with a nasty plus slider that serves as a true strikeout pitch and can even mix in a changeup against left-handed hitters. ORGANIZATION has been an issue and while hit doesn't have to be pinpoint, his time missed hasn't helped him learn to find the strike zone more consistently.The ORGANIZATION are pleased he made it back to competitive pitching in 2018. When he's ready, he'll have to spend 90 days on the big league active roster to get past Rule 5 restrictions.",0
"PERSON led ORGANIZATION prepsters in homers for three straight years and offered some of the best power among high school middle infielders in the 2014 Draft, but a so-so senior season and signability issues left him unselected and headed to PERSON. After playing sparingly as a freshman, PERSON erupted to hit 11 home runs the next year, then he blew past that total with 19 homers as a junior before going to the A's in the second round. After signing for $1.7 million, PERSON showcased his impressive power by hitting eight homers in 46 games as PERSON's everyday right fielder. Assigned to the GPE League for his first full season, PERSON logged just 10 games before a wrist injury landed him on the disabled list for nearly three months.PERSON's power is his calling card. The big left-handed hitter has impressed scouts with his bat speed and strength dating back to his high school days, and he's shown that he can get to it consistently in the past year-plus after shortening his swing and adopting a more selective approach. PERSON's improved approach also has helped him in using the entire field, though much of his power remains to his pull side. And while strikeouts will always be a part of PERSON's game given his power-over-hit profile, he does offset some of those concerns with perennially strong walk rates and on-base skills.A shortstop in high school, PERSON saw time at first base at ORGANIZATION before finding a home in right field, where his above-average arm and power profile are clean fits. He's a below-average runner but moves well underway, and with improved reads and routes, he could become an average defender.",0
"PERSON no doubt benefitted from decision makers picking in the top five to 10 coming in to see PERSON, as his name seems to be in the mix at many of those teams' second picks. He's a stocky, athletic catcher with a fine arm, and surprising bat speed and power. He hit .320/.420/.626 this year, emerging as a likely Day 1 selection. PERSON hasn't caught a lot of pro-quality stuff at ORGANIZATION, so that part of his skillset remains somewhat unclear, but we think he's athletic enough to improve if it's initially an issue.",0
"GPE has posted big power numbers everywhere he has gone in the last three years, starting with setting school records at LOCATION CC for batting (.419) and homers (16) in 2016, when GPE signed him as a fourth-rounder. He topped the Rookie-level PERSON in runs (63), total bases (161) and ORGANIZATION (1.052) during his pro debut, then encored by winning GPE League MVP honors and leading the Class A Advanced circuit in extra-base hits (61) and slugging (.514) during his first full season. He followed up in 2018 by pacing all Double-A hitters in homers (29) and the ORGANIZATION in extra-base hits (55) and total bases (232).Compared to PERSON for his power and surprising athleticism in a big frame, GPE can knock the ball out of any part of any ballpark thanks to his strength and leverage. His 6-foot-6 build comes with a naturally long right-handed swing that, coupled with his aggressive approach, resulted in a ORGANIZATION-worst 192 strikeouts and 34 percent whiff rate in 2018. He went through five different batting stances during the season as he searched for a way to make more contact, and the ORGANIZATION think he'll be able to do that after reworking his stroke during the offseason.GPE displays average speed out of the batter's box and is a step quicker once he gets going, which enabled him to play center field for the majority of his first three pro seasons. He's an average defender up the middle but better suited for a corner. His strong arm fits perfectly in right field, as does his power profile.",0
"PERSON was premium prospect out of a ORGANIZATION high school, reportedly turning down over $2.5 million to go to Stanford as he had long wanted to do. There, PERSON had various injury issues and his stuff and command didn't progress as many had hoped, but he still showed glimpses of his upside from high school. In instructional league, he ran his fastball up to 96 mph, which didn't happen often in college, and his signature hammer curveball flashed plus once again. PERSON is still in the nether region of starter vs. reliever given his uneven track record and command that doesn't consistently flash average, but his power stuff will play in any role if he can continue showing what he did in instructional league.",0
"PERSON is the nephew of PERSON, cousin of PERSON, Jr. and the two July 2nd prospects train together under PERSON in the GPE. The ORGANIZATION went hard after PERSON Jr. but ultimately pulled out when the price got too high and ended up gettign arguably the best 1-2 punch of prospects in this year's class with PERSON. PERSON has some of the same actions and swing mechanics as last year's top player, PERSON, and, like PERSON, also projects to move to third base eventually, but will play shortstop for the time being. PERSON isn't explosive like PERSON, who has 65-70 raw power and comparable bat speed, while PERSON is more above average in both regards, though PERSON has a much more under-control swing, so his offensive profile is more hit over power right now, though he should tap into that power more often in pro ball as he matures.",0
"The son of former 11-year Major Leaguer Fernando PERSON ranked 30th on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 prospects list for the 2015-16 international period before signing for $700,000 with the FACILITY, who shipped him to the Padres the following June as part of the PERSON trade. He made an immediate impact in his pro debut, finishing the season as a 17-year-old in the Class A Short-Season LOCATION, and then emerged as a top-flight prospect in 2017 as he became the first 18-year-old in ORGANIZATION history to post at least 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases. Perhaps even more impressive was how PERSON handled himself after making the jump directly to Double-A PERSON in GPE, and he continued to draw raves in his return to level in 2018 before undergoing season-ending surgery for a fractured thumb in late July.PERSON has all the ingredients to become an offensive force in the Majors, as his bat speed, leveraged swing and overall capacity to make adjustments all portend a future plus hitter with plus power. He proved vulnerable to spin and sequencing early in the year but tightened his approach as the season progressed en route to pacing the ORGANIZATION with 75 walks. Many evaluators believe PERSON is merely scraping the surface of his offensive potential, as he still has considerable room to grow into his tall and athletic frame. That larger frame doesn't currently impede PERSON's abilities at shortstop, where he makes highlight-reel plays on a daily basis thanks to his athleticism, range and rocket arm, though further physical development could ultimately force him to third base. Even if that's case, PERSON's bat gives him the ceiling of a perennial All-Star, possibly even an ORGANIZATION candidate in his prime.",1
"PERSON hits low-lying lasers, with several balls off the bat in excess of 115mph during PERSON's opening weekend in GPE. If sneaky plus-plus raw power exists, PERSON has it, as he generates it without taking max-effort hacks. There are teams that don't like PERSON in this range because they think he's a bad defender and/or they are concerned about his 20% strikeout rate, But PERSON's career 15% walk rate should help satiate the stat-driven people in draft rooms and his power numbers could take a jump if pro instruction coaxes more lift out of his swing. He checks every box for the risk-averse, analytics-driven clubs, which means he has a lot of potential homes in the 10-20 range.",0
"Another talented infielder from GPE, PERSON is listed as a shortstop, and he could stay there once he signs with a ORGANIZATION team and makes his way through the club's ORGANIZATION system.That said, some scouts believe PERSON is better suited for second base or even third base because of his versatility and arm strength. Evaluators also like his footwork, good hands and fluid actions on defense. PERSON say PERSON has a good feel for hitting and should be able to hit for average. Some evaluators do question his power potential, but there is a belief that he will get bigger and stronger as he matures. PERSON also like the fact that PERSON knows the game and continues to show signs of improvement in every area. PERSON is based in GPE, GPE, and is trained by former ORGANIZATION infielder PERSON at the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION are the favorites to land PERSON.",0
"The GPE signed PERSON out of GPE in 2014 because they liked his left arm and his feel for pitching at such a young age. While he had up-and-down results in the rookie levels of the system, they always felt there was a legitimate starting pitcher prospect in there and he started to show up in 2017, dominating from extended spring training all the way through his full-season debut in the ORGANIZATION League.While no one will ever mistake the smaller left-hander for a flamethrower, an uptick in overall stuff has certainly helped PERSON, as he missed more bats in 2017 than he had previously in his career. The velocity of his fastball his increased and he's now averaging 91 mph with it and touching 93 mph, thrown with good life to get ground-ball outs. He might have the best changeup in the system that fooled hitters on both sides of the plate and his big, looping curve improved as well, going from a third pitch that needed a ton of work to a third pitch he can count on. He can throw strikes with all three pitches, all coming from a very easy and repeatable delivery.There is a big up arrow next to PERSON's name currently as he pitches at age 20 in 2018. With the increased velocity and improvement in his breaking ball, he's made a big jump in the GPE system and used his pitchability to move more quickly.",1

The right-hander has a funky, off-balance delivery from a three-quarter arm slot, but his fastball presently sits at 86-88 mph. He needs some time to develop, but if he adds strength he will continue to intrigue even further.",0
"A very prominent high school prospect, PERSON matriculated to GPE and became a core of their lineup almost immediately.

"GPE has feel to hit from both sides of the plate and a non-zero chance to stick in center field, though he isn't as sure a bet to stay there as the some of the true burners ahead of him on this list.",0
"When PERSON was taken in the first round of the 2013 Draft, he was thought to be perhaps the best pure high school hitter in the class. He really started living up to that billing in 2015, when he won the ORGANIZATION State PERSON and then went on to hit very well in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON has always had a very good approach at the plate and tremendous hand-eye coordination. That has led to good batting average and on-base numbers, as he topped .300 in two of his first three professional seasons. There has always been some question about how much power PERSON will have, but he started showing more extra-base pop during his breakout campaign. Focusing on developing as a hitter first, he and the ORGANIZATION have been confident more over-the-fence power will start showing up in time, and it started to do so in Double-A during the 2016 season. A first baseman only, PERSON has the chance to be an above-average defender at the corner position.PERSON's hit tool should be enough to get him to the big leagues. How much the left-handed hitter develops his power will determine just what caliber of a big league first baseman he will become.",1
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON ORGANIZATION comes from a baseball family as his dad, PERSON, is the senior advisor to PERSON' ORGANIZATION A.J. Preller. The younger PERSON has committed to play at ORGANIZATION next season after finishing up his high school career at ORGANIZATION (Ariz.)PERSON plays multiple positions, and the versatility has served him well. PERSON has a savvy look on the diamond and possesses adequate skills at both catcher and first base.In the batter's box, he has a straightaway stance with a high back elbow.",0
" PERSON was a bit of an anomaly in the 2014 GPE class. High school second basemen aren't all that common. His bat and speed put the GPE prep standout high on GPE boards, and the Rockies were pleased he was still available when their turn in the ORGANIZATION Round A, at ORGANIZATION. 35 overall, came around. He lived up to his advanced billing by raking during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON has outstanding bat speed from the left side of the plate and he makes consistent line-drive contact to all fields. While he's not the biggest guy in the world, he does have some pop and should have the ability to keep pitchers honest as he progresses. He has an advanced approach at the plate and draws his fair share of walks, allowing his plus speed to work. He should continue to be a threat on the basepaths.A pair of shoulder injuries concerned some and has limited PERSON to the right side of the infield. But his exciting offensive profile should carry him up the ladder, even if it's as a bat-first second baseman.",0
"GPE has enough straight-line speed that some scouts think he could play the outfield or second base, but his already physical build would likely fill out beyond viability at those spots evetually, so catcher is his likely home. He has some strength-driven power but scouts have varied opinions on how much he's going to hit. Some think his stiffness in the box might be problematic.",0
"The consensus top-ranked prospect on the 2013 international market, PERSON landed a $2.8 million bonus as the most expensive of several ORGANIZATION big-ticket signings that summer. After he signed, one club official compared him to a 16-year-old version of PERSON PERSON.Like PERSON, PERSON has huge raw power and fits the right-field profile to a tee. He looked raw but not overmatched while making his GPE debut at age 17. His large, projectable frame is starting to add strength and already generates impressive bat speed and leverage. He shows the makings of plate discipline and pitch recognition, which will increase his chances of fully tapping into his home run potential.An average runner with a strong arm, PERSON can be an asset in right field but must improve the accuracy of his throws. The ORGANIZATION rave about his makeup, lauding him for going back to complete his high school degree in the ORGANIZATION and for making the effort to learn GPE quickly.",1
"PERSON was one of the ORGANIZATION' breakout prospects in 2012, and he continued that progress in '13, finishing his second year of full-season ball with Double-A GPE. PERSON built on that momentum during a full season in GPE in 2014.PERSON has fast hands, helping him square up balls consistently from both sides of the plate. He has more power than his frame would suggest, and he can drive balls to all fields. PERSON has above-average speed and aggressively uses his speed on the basepaths, but he is still learning how to be a basestealer.For all his offensive prowess, PERSON remains a work in progress at shortstop. He has good range and his infield actions are improved, but his arm strength is fringy. Scouts are divided on whether PERSON can remain at shortstop or if he is better suited for second base. No matter where he ends up defensively, PERSON's bat will play.",1
"PERSON has a great body, beautiful swing, and runs well enough to stay in center field. The rest of his skills are under-developed. Most significantly behind is PERSON' ball and strike recognition, and he may never have a playable hit tool because of it. But he was a two-sport high school athlete who missed early-career reps with a hamstring injury, so there's a chance some of this stuff is still coming. This is a classic boom or bust type prospect, as there's a lot of theoretical upside because of his speed, defensive profile, and power projection.",0
"PERSON de PERSON remains one of the biggest enigmas in the GPE, perhaps the biggest. He had PERSON surgery as a ORGANIZATION high school junior in 2013 and ulnar nerve transposition three years later, and he turned down the FACILITY as a 14th-rounder in 2014 and the ORGANIZATION as a 15th-rounder last summer. While all that is off-putting to a lot of teams, when he's on he might have the most devastating pair of pitches available in this year's crop.PERSON de PERSON can work at 93-98 mph and reach 100 with exceptionally heavy sink on his fastball, which can get top-of-the-scale grades for both its velocity and its life. His breaking ball has gone from a power slurve to more of a true slider that climbs into the upper 80s and is a wipeout offering at its best. Both pitches were overpowering when he worked the first seven innings of a no-hitter against Maryland-Baltimore County in GPE, when he struck out 12 of the 23 batters he faced and permitted just two balls to be hit in the air.After continuing to excel in the rotation over the next month, PERSON de PERSON pitched just 11 innings over the final seven weeks of the regular season without any explanation as to why his role changed. His lack of a reliable changeup and his inability to throw consistent strikes point to a future in the bullpen. With his stuff, he could move rapidly as a reliever and have closer upside if he stays healthy.",0
"Guys his size -- PERSON is 6-foot-7, 240 pounds -- stand out on the baseball field. As one would imagine, PERSON has considerable raw power from the right side of the plate, winning a college home run derby over the summer. That pop has not shown up consistently in games for PERSON much, though he did flex his muscles for five homers on the Cape last summer.PERSON has patience at the plate, runs pretty well and has a strong arm, all the tools for a future right fielder. How he performed during his junior season with the bat was going to determine where he lands on PERSON boards.That performance was a bit up-and-down but a team that saw him on a good day -- and put stock in his strong Cape performance --might be willing to gamble he'll hit enough to tap into that power at the next level.",1
"Trapped in the ORGANIZATION market's penalty box after their 2016 Cuban shopping spree, the Cardinals were still able to find some interesting $300,000 talent in each of the following two years. NuÃ±ez is the best hitter of that bunch and he posted god-like numbers in the ORGANIZATION last year, slashing .415/.497/.774 with 31 extra-base hits in 44 games. Already to be taken with a healthy grain of salt, ORGANIZATION numbers are often faulty when the prospect in question is more physically mature than his peers, and the hefty NuÃ±ez is a classic case. He will likely need to move to first base, perhaps even while he's still in the minors, putting a ton of pressure on his admittedly prodigious bat to fully actualize. There's not much physical projection here, so the raw power NuÃ±ez currently has is pretty close to what he'll have at peak, meaning the bat-to-ball component is what will drive his stock going forward.",0
"Several high school left-handers have boosted their stock this spring into the top two or three rounds of the GPE, PERSON among them. A member of the GPE national team that won a gold medal at the 18-and-under World Cup in GPE last September, he has passed right-hander Zach Linginfelter as the top prep prospect in GPE. PERSON entered the year considered one of the more polished southpaws in the 2016 high school crop, and his stuff has kicked up a notch. After working with an upper-80s fastball last summer, he has pitched in the low 90s more frequently as a senior. His curveball has added some power and sharpness, giving him a second solid offering.Though he doesn't need to use his changeup much in games, PERSON shows some feel for the pitch during bullpen sessions and it has some fade and tumble. He's still fine-tuning his command but displays some aptitude for working both sides of the plate. If he follows through on his commitment to GPE, he'll be eligible for the 2018 GPE as a sophomore.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION traded closer PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in December 2015, they received a pair of players in return: infielder PERSON and PERSON, who was coming off a breakout season. Neither trade acquisition had the kind of 2016 season the ORGANIZATION had hoped, with PERSON dealing with an injury that impacted his stuff. He bounced back with a strong Spring Training that led to a spot in the big league rotation. That was short-lived, and he dealt with a back strain in the Minors this season.The 6-foot-5 right-hander tried to battle through his groin injury in 2016, but he wasn't able to get out front or have any extension, causing his velocity to drop and keeping him from being able to finish his breaking ball. Once he got healthy, the velocity did return and he looked more like the guy the ORGANIZATION thought they were getting, a strong, durable starting pitcher with three at least PERSON average pitches he can throw for strikes.There is still confidence that if PERSON can stay healthy, he has the ceiling of a No. 4 type starter. He should get another chance to show what he can do soon.",1
"PERSON' thick lower half and average arm portend a move to second base, where his footwork and quick actions could make him an above average defender. He has a compact stroke from both sides of the plate and projects as an aboev average hitter. His upside will be dictated by how much game power he can grow into.",0
"PERSON emerged as ORGANIZATION's leading postseason hitter during the team's 2013 College World Series championship run, only to miss all of the next two seasons. He lost 2014 after injuring his right (throwing) shoulder and requiring labrum surgery, then he was suspended for all of '15 after he plagiarized part of a paper for a philosophy class. PERSON returned to the GPE in 2016 and then signed for $1,000 as a 20th-round pick at age 24, making him one of the oldest players in the 2016 Draft. After excelling in his first full season in the Class A Advanced GPE League and then again in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON was suspended for the first 50 games of the 2018 season following his second positive test for a drug of abuse in January. The ORGANIZATION acquired him in June as the player to be named in the trade that sent PERSON to the Mariners in GPE, only to return him to GPE several days later and instead settle for cash considerations to complete the trade.PERSON has one of the more advanced approaches among PERSON hitters, with outstanding pitch and zone recognition, plus bat-to-ball skills and innate feel to hit from line to line. He led the LOCATION in hitting (.362) and on-base percentage (.450) and won the short-season circuit's ORGANIZATION in his pro debut, and then ranked first in the GPE League in GPE (.407) and third in batting (.326) in his sophomore campaign. He encored with standout performance in the ORGANIZATION, where he saw time at both corner outfield positions as well as first base.Pure hitting ability and on-base skills -- he accrued 20 more walks than strikeouts in 2017 -- are PERSON's calling cards to the ORGANIZATION, as he otherwise possesses average-at-best tools. But while it may be easy to peg him as a future fourth or fifth outfielder, there's something to be said about PERSON's track record of surpassing expectations.",0
"GPE had been an interesting, if not high-profile prospect entering the spring. When he tossed four shutout frames at ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION in GPE, he put himself much more firmly on the map.GPE looks like the quintessential projectable high school right-hander, one who saw an uptick in his velocity this spring and who might have more in the tank. He's been up to 94 mph at times this spring, mostly sitting in the 90-93 mph range. He'll flash a slider that looks like it could be above-average, in the 78-82 mph range, but it often gets caught in between a slider and curve. He'll occasionally show some feel for a changeup, but he doesn't always throw it. The biggest drawback to GPE's profile is his arm action, which creates control problems and scouts don't love and think it makes him lean toward a reliever profile. GPE is committed to PERSON and could head there if the ORGANIZATION doesn't go the way he hopes. A team willing to bet on the upside potential and being able to clean up his delivery could take a chance at signing him away from school in the top six rounds.",0

"PERSON High (ORGANIZATION, GPE.) has produced a number of interesting prospects in the last decade, from GPE first-rounder PERSON (2007) to two-way star PERSON (2011; his career fizzled after a promising start at LOCATION) to GPE fifth-rounder PERSON (2014). The ORGANIZATION' latest is PERSON' brother PERSON, who also has two-way talent but almost certainly will get drafted as a position player. He led PERSON to GPE state 6-A runner-up finishes in each of the last two seasons and was the coaches association's choice as the state 6-A player of the year in 2016.PERSON is an advanced high school hitter with a compact left-handed swing and an all-fields approach. His line-drive stroke isn't conducive to present power, but he has the bat speed and strength for at least average power once he lifts and turns on pitches more often.PERSON moves well for his size and is an asset defensively at first base. He has a better arm than most players at his position and can reach the low 90s with his fastball when he pitches. A left-hander, he also has a pair of promising secondary pitches and will pull double duty for ORGANIZATION State if he makes it to college.",0
"PERSON reached PERSON's top league as a 17-year-old and recorded a 9.45 ERA in 2011-12 before defecting from the island. Since signing for $40,000 in September 2014, he has steadily worked his way through the ORGANIZATION' system. He reached Triple-A this July, barely two years after he made his GPE pro debut.PERSON doesn't have a plus pitch but he keeps hitters off balance by mixing five offerings, the best of which is his deceptive changeup. He can work up in the strike zone with a four-seam fastball that sits at 91-93 mph and tops out at 95, or use the sink on his 88-92 mph two-seamer to get ground balls. He throws two breaking balls, with his curveball more effective than his slider/cutter.Like his stuff, PERSON' control and command grade as average. While he doesn't have a lofty ceiling, he has a good feel for his craft and his repeated success can't be ignored. He could help PERSON as a back-of-the-rotation starter or middle reliever in the near future.",0
GPE's swing has a pretty finish that shows off just how loose and rotationally explosive he is. His physical tools are modest but the bat has a chance to carry him.,0
"PERSON's junior stats at LOCATION read like he was playing ORGANIZATION on the rookie difficulty setting. It was his first year as a starter and he struck out 144 hitters in 102 innings while walking just 18. He's a side-armer with a running, low-90s fastball and above-average slider. Both pitches play up because of PERSON's command, and at times his stuff is so well-located that it's unhittable. He was our favorite to be the first from the 2018 draft class to reach the big leagues but a 2019 spring forearm injury might delay his arrival.",0
"Drafted out of ORGANIZATION as a red-shirt junior who had PERSON surgery, PERSON has shown a combination of intriguing stuff and subpar command in his brief pro career. That, plus his 5-foot-10, 200-pound frame, have some believing he's a reliever long-term, though the Rays continue to allow him to develop as a starter.PERSON has a power arsenal that misses bats consistently. His fastball touches the mid-90s and features considerable arm-side run, and he combines it with a power breaking ball and a potentially average changeup. As good as his swing-and-miss stuff is, he struggles finding the strike zone, walking 5.6 batters per nine innings heading into 2016.While he does maintain his velocity into starts and doesn't have a ton of effort in his delivery, most feel PERSON will end up in the bullpen, where he could see an uptick in velocity and serve as an effective short reliever.",0
"PERSON was sandwiched between PERSON and PERSON in the 2010 Draft. PERSON and GPE are both already All-Stars. PERSON was on the verge of joining them in the ORGANIZATION before it was discovered that he needed PERSON surgery in April 2014.PERSON is a classic power right-hander, mixing good size with a mid-90s fastball and a hard curveball. His changeup has also made strides, giving him a chance for three above-average pitches. PERSON's fastball has good sinking action, but it tends to flatten out and become easier to hit if he leaves it up in the zone.PERSON commands his pitches well and earns praise for his poise and confidence on the mound.

"An Ontario native, GPE pitched one season at ORGANIZATION State JC (Okla.) before transferring to ORGANIZATION and serving as the team's closer in 2014. He signed with the ORGANIZATION for $25,000 as a 10th-round pick that June, but missed the entire 2015 season while recovering from PERSON surgery. He returned to the mound fully healthy last June and impressed as part of Class A Lansing's starting rotation, his first work as a starter since 2013, and he's made even greater strides this season as a member of Class A Advanced PERSON's starting rotation. GPE has shown plenty of arm strength post-surgery. His fastball sits comfortably at 92-94 mph, with good life and some run, and reaches 96, and it's easy to see GPE, with his physically strong frame, adding even more velocity. His power slider gives GPE a second above-average pitch, and he's capable of missing bats with both. His changeup is well below average, however, and he'll need to at least make it a viable offering to remain a starter.Most scouts think that GPE will eventually return to the bullpen, where his fastball-slider combination could make him a late-inning option. But with his success over the last two seasons, GPE is looking more and more like someone who can stick as a starter.",0
"PERSON has had some of the best tools in the organization since the ORGANIZATION invested $2.2 million in him as the 29th overall pick in the 2009 Draft. He has yet to complete a fully healthy season, repeatedly battling shoulder and knee injuries that began in high school. He finally made his big league debut this May and homered off PERSON -- only to go on the disabled list three days later with a quad strain.If he can stay on the field and refine his hitting ability, PERSON offers the bat speed and strength to bat in the middle of a big league lineup. He has some uppercut to his left-handed swing and can get overly aggressive at the plate. Playing just 309 games in his first six pro seasons has hampered his development.When he's 100 percent, PERSON exhibits plus speed, outfield defense and arm strength.

"The ORGANIZATION have liked PERSON' offensive potential ever since they scouted him at ORGANIZATION leading up to the 2012 PERSON. But ever since they took him with the 45th overall pick in that June's PERSON, they've had a hard time watching him develop, as injuries have largely kept him off of the field. He was relatively healthy in 2015 and managed to reach Double-A for the first time.PERSON has always shown an ability to hit. The lack of reps means his approach is still a bit raw, but he's not clueless at the plate, with some pitch and strike zone recognition. He has plus bat speed that should lead to more power than he's shown thus far. Despite numerous leg injuries, PERSON still runs well and can steal a base. He's bounced around the outfield and seeing more time in the corners may have taken away some of the demands of playing center field on a daily basis. He'll probably end up in a corner full-time in the future, likely left due to a fringy arm.More than anything, PERSON has learned what he needs to do to keep his body intact and on the field. He'll have to continue to show he can stay healthy to succeed at the upper levels of the system.",0
"One of the youngest and most projectable players in the high school crop, Day is a 6-foot-4, 162-pounder with a deep and promising repertoire. Assuming he adds strength and maintains his clean delivery, he could develop three plus offerings.Day already throws his fastball at 90-93 mph, enhancing its velocity by adding sinking life and throwing it on a steep plane. He has advanced feel for his secondary pitches, an upper-70s curveball with good depth and a low-80s changeup that drops at the plate. His stock fell this spring, however, when he tried to light up radar guns, got away from using his changeup and saw his control and command regress.Vanderbilt has had five pitchers selected in the first round of the last eight Drafts and could have two more in 2015. It's easy envisioning Day added to that list if he follows through on his commitment to the ORGANIZATION.",0

He'll flash a solid slider at times, though it lacks consistency. He has some feel for a changeup, but he doesn't need it much against ORGANIZATION hitters or in a bullpen role.PERSON has a loose arm and a strong build, and he does a reasonable job of throwing strikes.

After pitching extremely well at the ORGANIZATION Game WWBA World Championship in GPE, Fla., this past fall, he's been a bit more uneven during his senior year at ORGANIZATION in GPE. PERSON, he's shown a lot to work with, starting with a fastball that touches 94 mph. He's developed a very good changeup that might be his best secondary pitch, though he doesn't throw it enough. His breaking ball has come and gone, sometimes throwing it with good, tight rotation.PERSON has overcome adversity, showing he can excel after having a clubbed right foot that required two surgeries when he was younger. He's a top five round talent, with the question being what it might take to sign him away from his GPE commitment.",0
"GPE underwent PERSON surgery during his sophomore year at GPE in July 2012, and he didn't return to the mound until '14. The ORGANIZATION made him their fourth-round pick that June and then limited his workload in his pro debut. GPE moved up to full-season ball in 2015 and received a quick promotion to the Class A Advanced California League, where he was pitching when the ORGANIZATION acquired him in the ORGANIZATION deal at the ORGANIZATION. While the quality of GPE's stuff fluctuated in his first full year back from surgery, he still showed a lively 90-94 mph fastball that hit 97 with good arm-side run. The right-hander complements his heater with a slider in the low 80s that flashes above average, and he also has a changeup that has yet to materialize post-surgery. GPE's control hasn't been great as a professional, although that's not uncommon for pitchers in the early stages of recovery from PERSON surgery. The ORGANIZATION will continue to develop GPE as a starter, but his fastball-slider pairing and below-average control suggest he'll end up in the bullpen.",0
"The track record of GPE high school picks isn't reassuring -- in 49 Drafts, only PERSON and PERSON have had significant big league careers -- but the state consistently produces intriguing prep prospects. In the past five years, three PERSON high school position players have gone in the top two rounds, most notably PERSON (ORGANIZATION, second round in 2009). The state's latest prep phenom is ORGANIZATION, who's very easy to dream on. He's extremely projectable at 6-foot-4 and 175 pounds, and he's very athletic as well. He's an above-average runner who can steal bases and cover ground at shortstop. He could outgrow the position, but his arm strength would fit at third base, and he also could be a center fielder.A GPE recruit, ORGANIZATION offers offensive upside, too. He hasn't looked overmatched against showcase competition and projects as a solid hitter down the road. His bat speed could lend itself to plenty of pop, especially once he adds strength to his frame.",0

The scouting industry is still split down the middle on whether he'd be better suited on the mound or behind the plate at the next level.PERSON has spent more time, especially in showcases, showing what he can do as a pitcher. He has a live fastball that can touch 94-95 mph and complements it with a solid curveball and a changeup that flashes above-average. He can fill the strike zone with all three, coming from a high slot. The ORGANIZATION commit also has the chance to a special catcher. He has good hands and a plus arm defensively and while he's a below-average runner, his athleticism helps him move well behind the dish. He swings the bat well from a crouch set up, with quiet pop that could end up being average power in the future.The one thing scouts agree on is that PERSON's grades will improve once he starts to focus on one craft.

While some worried about his ability to stay at third in the past, PERSON showed good defensive improvement in 2013 and answered some of those questions. The ORGANIZATION certainly had no plans to move him and he should fit the profile of a run-producing third baseman very well.",0

His swing is more geared to hitting line drives, but scouts believe he can add more strength to his lean frame and hit for more power as a result.

"The ORGANIZATION signed GPE for $100,000 as a high school catcher in the 12th round of the 2013 Draft, then moved him to second base two years later and saw him break out in 2016 with 15 homers between two Class A stops. He solidified his status as one of the better offensive second-base prospects over the next two seasons, swatting 39 extra-base hits and stealing 19 bases in Double-A in 2018. The ORGANIZATION acquired him and a ORGANIZATION Round A pick from the ORGANIZATION in January when they jettisoned PERSON, then flipped him to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for PERSON Stowers.GPE's left-handed bat is his calling card. Despite his 5-foot-8 frame, he has shown the ability to consistently impact the baseball. The power is legitimate, coming from outstanding bat speed and very quick hands. He does strike out some, but his walk rate went up in 2017 and he's shown a willingness to use all fields. Possessing average speed at best, he's an aggressive baserunner who can pick his spots to steal.Though GPE has worked hard to adapt to second base, he'll probably be adequate at best. He has enough arm for the position but lacks soft hands and smooth footwork. He may be better suited for an outfield corner, though that would put more pressure on his bat.",1
"After landing a modest $45,000 bonus at the relatively advanced age of 18 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2014, PERSON emerged as one of the best arms in the ORGANIZATION' system. He came straight to the GPE for his 2015 pro debut and earned rapid promotions in each of his first three pro seasons. His control lapsed last year, but he still recorded a 3.44 ERA at two Class A stops because he was able to overpower hitters. He reached Double-A for the first time in GPE, only to then be dealt to the ORGANIZATION later in the month with PERSON and PERSON in exchange for PERSON. PERSON can blow his fastball by hitters, ranging from 93-99 mph with two-seamers with nice sink and four-seamers with explosive riding life. He also can produce wipeout breaking stuff when he's on, though there are times when he can't find the strike zone with his slider or curveball. He uses a splitter as a changeup, and it likewise can elicit swings and misses or avoid the plate.Opponents struggle to make solid contact against PERSON, who has four pitches that can grade as plus or better but lose effectiveness when he can't tame them. He's athletic enough to figure out control and command, but his delivery has timing issues that have prevented him from throwing consistent strikes. His walk rate jumped from 4.5 per nine innings in his first two seasons to 6.5 in his third, a sign that he's more likely to become a late-inning reliever than a frontline starter.",0
"At times, PERSON looks like a stiff, velo-only bullpen prospect. At others, he's competing in or near the zone with four pitches, including a splitter that got much better over the winter. All four pitches give hitters a vastly different look. PERSON' mid-90s fastball has tailing action, his curveball has vertical depth and eats up hitters who are cheating on velo, the split has late bottom when it's on, and the slider has horizontal, cutting action. The movement profile of PERSON' fastball may not be the best for missing bats, but it's likely to be an impact pitch because of the velocity. He could end up with three average secondaries (there's a chance the split becomes better than that) and enough strikes to start, making him a potential No. 4/5 starter.",0
"In many ways, the 2014 season was a huge success for PERSON, as the GPE native competed well as an 18-year-old in the ORGANIZATION. But he suffered a setback in September when he sprained the ORGANIZATION in his left elbow. Though he didn't need surgery then, he reinjured his elbow in GPE Training and will miss the 2015 season as he recovers from PERSON surgery. Before his injury, PERSON was physically maturing and honing his four-pitch mix. He should pitch consistently in the low 90s with his fastball and offset it with an above-average changeup. He throws two breaking balls, adding a slider last year that he started to throw more often. Both have the chance to be solid average pitches, but they need to be tightened up, as his curve gets loopy at times. His command should improve with more experience.PERSON cites former big leaguer PERSON as a mentor. If PERSON can return to full health, the former GPE reliever should be able to watch his pupil with pride in the middle of a big league rotation in the future.",1
" Repeating a level can be a good thing. After struggling in the LOCATION League in his first full season, PERSON went back there and dominated, being named the leagueâs Most Outstanding Pitcher. His lean and lanky frame fit the prototype for projectable right-handers. A power pitcher, he has a three-pitch mix that should work well for him, starting with a plus fastball that touches 98 mph, coming from a loose and easy arm action. His downer curve will show decent bite and heâs able to maintain his arm speed on his sinking changeup. Once he tightens up the secondary pitches and improves his command, he has everything a team would want from a workhorse in a big league rotation.",1
"PERSON is an above average runner whose strides allow him to adequately traverse center field for now, though he has a very projectable frame and could move to a corner. His swing is flat and his timing is poor, but PERSON has loose hands and gorgeous extension through contact. He has the physical tools to thi, he just needs a mechanical adjustment, and it's even more imperative he gets one if he eventually moves to a corner. ",1
"Primarily a reliever in his first two seasons at FACILITY A&M, PERSON opened his junior year as the ORGANIZATION' No. 3 starter and claimed the top spot in their rotation by mid-April. He won his first eight decisions over his first nine starts, boosting his ORGANIZATION stock into the first three rounds. PERSON lacks a plus pitch in his arsenal but is pretty solid across the board with control to match. His fastball operates in the low 90s and tops out at 94 mph, and his sink and downhill plane allow him to pound the bottom of the strike zone. He can throw his low-80s slider for strikes or entice hitters to chase it off the plate, and he does a nice job of locating his average changeup to keep left-handers honest.PERSON has an easy delivery and no trouble repeating it, allowing him to steadily improve his control throughout his college career. He doesn't have the sexiest ceiling, but he has a high floor as a safe bet to start. His track record of performance in multiple roles in the rugged LOCATION also helps his cause.",0
" PERSON ORGANIZATION and PERSON are in the big leagues making large contributions. PERSON could be the next homegrown bat to make a huge impact in GPE. The third baseman has a ton of bat speed and has the ability to drive the ball from both sides of the plate, and he should continue to tap into his raw power. His improvements with his approach and plate discipline are helping him become a better all-around hitter. PERSON is an above-average runner and his athleticism, not to mention his plus throwing arm, will help him stay at third long-term. He has the chance to be a very good everyday big leaguer whose tools work very well on both sides of the ball.",1
"GPE isn't typically a hotbed for high school pitching talent, though a good arm comes from the region from time to time. In this year's PERSON class, right-hander PERSON is the top talent, even with his injury, and while PERSON isn't in the same conversation, he is the best left-hander from the area.Aside from his left-handedness, PERSON has size, stuff and projectability working in his favor. The 6-foot-4 southpaw has room to grow into his frame, which means there could me more to his fastball in the future, which he can throw anywhere from 86 to 93 mph, sitting comfortably right around 89-90 mph. His slider projects as at least average, if not more, once he tightens it more consistently. It can have some slurve action to it, but it has enough depth to be a potential swing and miss pitch. He doesn't use a changeup at all and hasn't needed it at his high school level. He has a funky delivery, all arms and legs, which adds deception, but he still throws strikes.Scouts have watched PERSON carefully, particularly since last summer's PERSON, and were running in to see him as the weather warmed in GPE. He's committed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE, but a team might be willing to gamble on his upside from the left side to take him early enough to sign.",0
"One of the best high school position prospects in the 2013 Draft, PERSON saw his chances of going in the first round disappear when he tore the meniscus in his right knee in a season-opening doubleheader. He honored his commitment to GPE and turned in three strong seasons for the ORGANIZATION before the ORGANIZATION made him the highest-drafted position player to come out of the program since PERSON in 2005 by selecting him in the second round of the 2016 Draft.After making his pro debut in the Class A Short PERSON York-Penn League, PERSON made the jump straight to Class A Advanced Charlotte in 2017 and impressed over a full season in the ORGANIZATION State League, where he ranked among the circuit leaders with a .295 average (third), 130 hits (third) and 23 steals (eighth). His left-handed swing has a level plane that helps him use the entire field and deliver power to the gaps, and club officials believe he'll eventually develop some over-the-fence power as he gains experience and adds more strength to his projectable frame. PERSON has good speed but isn't as quick as he was in high school, though he did make noticeable gains with his basestealing technique and reading pitchers in '17. PERSON can hold his own in center field, where he gets good jumps and takes efficient routes on fly balls, but he likely profiles better at an outfield corner long-term. He's seen time at all three spots early in his career, portending a potential career as a fourth or fifth outfielder in the big leagues.",0
"PERSON has thrown just three pro innings since signing, as the minor flexor strain that shelved him after his draft turned out to be a prelude to surgery. He was given a ORGANIZATION injection in an attempt to avoid PERSON, but it was unsuccessful and he was operated on in early July of 2018. The timing of the surgery may keep PERSON out for all of 2019. When he finally returns, he'll be a 21-year-old with less developmental polish than a lot of teenage prospects from year-round baseball areas like GPE and GPE, as a former two-way, cold-weather high schooler who will have missed about 30 consecutive months of reps. 
The summer before his senior year, PERSON was 88-92 with better command and changeup feel than is typical for a northern prep arm. His velocity ticked up the following spring and he was touching 96, then sat 92-95 in his few pro innings before his injury. If his stuff comes back, he has No. 4 starter upside.",0
"Ever since the D-backs acquired PERSON from the ORGANIZATION for a ORGANIZATION B pick, all the outfielder has done is hit. Two levels in two years resulted in a .307 average, and he brought his hit parade to the upper levels of the system in 2017, finishing with a .292 average in Double-A. The D-backs didn't add him to their 40-man roster and the ORGANIZATION made him the ORGANIZATION. 1 pick in December's Rule 5 Draft.PERSON employs a simple, line-drive swing and delivered some of the best at-bats from both sides of the plate in the D-backs' system. He doesn't walk a ton, but he also rarely strikes out, consistently finding the barrel. A good runner, PERSON has shown some basestealing ability and that his speed plays in the outfield as well. He's mostly played the corners, but he also is capable of manning center field.Just 22 for all of the 2017 season, the move to Double-A was a good test for PERSON and his contact-oriented approach. If he can grow into a little more extra-base pop, he could become an everyday corner outfielder, though he likely profiles better as a fourth outfielder, a role he will get a chance to fill right away in 2018.",1
"PERSON was a bit of an afterthought as a prospect after he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $55,000 in 2011. He spent his first four seasons between the ORGANIZATION and Short-Season levels before advancing to full-season ball in 2015 and breaking out with PERSON en route to PERSON of the Year honors. He took home the award again the following season while finishing the year in Double-A, prompting the ORGANIZATION to add him to their 40-man roster. He did miss time early in the 2017 season due to a strained left forearm, though it didn't keep PERSON from earning midseason All-Star honors in the LOCATION after finally taking the field in June. PERSON stands out most for his natural hitting ability, as he's an advanced left-handed hitter with a mature approach and a clean, repeatable swing that generates hard contact from line to line and gives him utility against same-sided arms. He has some pop, too, albeit mostly to the gaps, but the ORGANIZATION believe he'll eventually clear more fences once he becomes comfortable turning on the ball and letting the barrel fly. Though he's proved serviceable in left field, PERSON' below-average speed and athleticism is better suited for first base at higher levels. He lacks the power to profile as an everyday big leaguer there but has enough feel to hit and on-base to serve as a future bench option for the ORGANIZATION.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 21, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON as a can't-miss athlete, PERSON is a unique prospect because of his incredible production as both a wide receiver and as a hard-throwing right-handed pitcher.With a commitment to GPE for baseball, PERSON may potentially leave behind a highly successful football career that featured 34 touchdowns in one season, the second-highest single-season mark in GPE high school football history.After hitting over .400 and going undefeated as a pitcher in 2016, PERSON was named to the ORGANIZATION baseball team, a roster made of the best baseball players in the state of GPE. PERSON has also earned a 2015 ORGANIZATION and a 2016 ORGANIZATION Second Team honor.",0
"PERSON took the ORGANIZATION by storm in his first full professional season, showing why many evaluators had rated him as the top talent in the 2012 Draft class. He appeared poised to continue his PERSON Trout-like climb to the big leagues when a wrist injury initially suffered in GPE Training forced him to miss a large amount of the 2014 season.Assuming PERSON doesn't have any lingering effects upon his return, he'll get back to showing he's a legitimate five-tool player. He has a simple, direct swing and creates excellent bat speed. PERSON's power has already been better than expected, and scouts expect it to improve more as he grows. His speed grades out at the top of the scale and he knows how to use it on the basepaths. Defensively, PERSON covers plenty of ground in center field and has good instincts in the outfield.The Twins are traditionally conservative in their developmental timelines, though PERSON had put himself on an accelerated track to the ORGANIZATION before his injury.",1
"PERSON landed an above-slot bonus from the GPE as a seventh-rounder in 2011, forgoing his commitment to PERSON. He struggled to make progress early in his career, but finally advanced to Double-A GPE in his sixth professional season. Returning to GPE in 2017, PERSON rewarded the GPE for their patience with a breakout campaign on both sides of the ball before finishing the season in Triple-A. After the season, the GPE rewarded him with a spot on their 40-man roster.PERSON has long showed big right-handed power, but he didn't get to it consistently until 2017, when he connected on a career-high 27 homers and paced all GPE farmhands with a .578 slugging percentage after making several key adjustments to his swing. PERSON will always be a large part of PERSON's game, but he does have some hitting ability as well as a solid approach that yielded a career-best walk rate in '17. PERSON's defense, much like his bat, has steadily improved, though questions remain about whether he can catch regularly at the highest level. He's worked to clean up his footwork in recent years while also making gains as a blocker and receiver. He continues to show a strong arm, and it helped him throw out a career-high 37 percent of attempted basestealers in 2017.",0
"The compensation pick the ORGANIZATION received for losing PERSON to free agency, PERSON signed for $1.9 million as the 30th overall pick in 2013. He went deep in his first pro at-bat and led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with 25 homers as a 19-year-old in his first full season, but his encore was disappointing. PERSON hit five homers in two months in the ORGANIZATION before drawing an 80-game suspension after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance. While challenging for the ORGANIZATION home run lead in 2016, he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION in return for PERSON and PERSON has much more power than the typical second baseman, generating it with bat speed and backspin from the right side of the plate. He shows some ability to draw the walks and use the whole field, but he's too aggressive at the plate. PERSON struck out in 35 percent of his plate appearances over his first three pro seasons, in large part because he's still figuring out how to deal with breaking pitches.A shortstop in high school, PERSON has a strong arm and average speed that many scouts thought would fit best at third base. With PERSON and PERSON at third base, the ORGANIZATION moved him to second base in 2014. PERSON had adapted well to his new position and should become at least an average defender there. Now without those obstacles, but the possibility of PERSON playing second for a long time, the ORGANIZATION might consider giving PERSON a look at the hot corner.",0
"  Any baseball field PERSON is on, he looks like he belongs, whether it was as the youngest regular in the ORGANIZATION in 2012 or in a big league stadium at the ORGANIZATION. An argument can be made that PERSON is the best defensive shortstop in the Minors. Not only does he have an outstanding arm and well above-average range, but those tools play up because of his off-the-charts instincts and feel for the position. But he's far from all glove. He has a quick swing and advanced approach that leads to hard line drives to all fields. He has some power, particularly to the pull side, but can also play small ball. An above-average runner, those instincts allow him to be a basestealing threat. His tools combined with his plus plus makeup have most believing he'll make an impact in GPE in a hurry.",1
"A very prominent high school prospect, PERSON matriculated to GPE and became a core of their lineup almost immediately. Though his swing is somewhat grooved, he's an athletic swinger with power, who is also quite good at third base. He has a shot to be an everyday third baseman.",0
"  PERSON has quickly taken to pitching since the ORGANIZATION moved him from the infield to the mound after signing him out of the ORGANIZATION in 2012. He stood out in the ORGANIZATION League the next year, but his progress was slowed in 2014 by a left wrist fracture that kept him out the final two months of the season. PERSON has a projectable frame and a powerful arm. His fastball already reaches 98 mph and his power curveball has plus potential as well. He also throws a changeup, which is still in its nascent stages of development. He has proven to be adept at generating groundballs.Thanks to his athleticism and exciting stuff, PERSON has a lot of upside. More than anything, he needs to get more innings under his belt so he can learn more of the nuances of his craft.",0
"ORGANIZATION was started a few years ago in GPE as a place for high-level high school level players to focus more of their day on baseball, while taking care of classwork online through the ORGANIZATION. ORGANIZATION has been one of the better products of the academy to date, with some serious upside, though it does not come without risk.There is no question that ORGANIZATION looks the part of an impactful offensive player and has the bat skills to go along with it. He has tremendous raw power with the ability to drive the ball with the kind of different sound you hear from some hitters when he makes contact. With that power, however, comes some considerable swing and miss issues, as scouts see a grooved swing. It goes a long way when the ball is thrown in that groove, but he doesn't always adjust when it's not. A fringy rurnner, ORGANIZATION is a capable outfielder with a very strong arm, and he gets high marks for his makeup. If a team believes he can make enough contact to tap into that power, it could see him as a future run-producing right fielder and take him early enough to keep him from heading to ORGANIZATION.",0
"He lasted 26 rounds in the 2011 Draft, yet PERSON commanded a $175,000 bonus after boosting his stock in the ORGANIZATION that summer. PERSON didn't get much of an early return on its investment as he posted a 4.73 ERA in his first three pro seasons, but he had a breakthrough season in Double-A in 2015. During the offseason, PERSON was selected by the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION phase of the Rule 5 Draft.PERSON has a plus fastball that usually operates from 91-94 mph and can hit 96. He trusts his changeup more than his curveball, though the latter shows flashes of becoming an average third offering with some depth.PERSON has improved his control significantly during the last two years, enhancing his chances of becoming a back-of-the-rotation starter. He doesn't miss a lot of bats because he doesn't have a standout second offering or sharp command, so he might be best as a middle reliever who might pitch in the mid 90s in short stints.",0
"PERSON nearly signed with the ORGANIZATION for $80,000 as a 23rd-round pick out of high school in 2010, but the deal died when a physical revealed a bone chip in his elbow. He spent a year each at FACILITY (Fla.) JC and PERSON (Fla.) JC before turning pro as a fourth-rounder in 2012. He spent his pro debut as a reliever, then skipped a level, became a starter and led the Class A Advanced PERSON with 139 strikeouts and 9.4 whiffs per nine innings last year.With his four-pitch repertoire, PERSON should be able to remain in the rotation. He throws 90-93 mph on a downhill plane and can reach 96. He has improved his secondary pitches since signing, as his hard slider and sinking changeup can be solid at times, and he also can mix in a decent curveball.PERSON lacks a true plus pitch but still has the ceiling of a No. 3 or 4 starter. There may be a little more projection remaining in his 6-foot-4 frame, and his clean delivery is easy to repeat and allows him to throw lots of strikes.",1
A plus runner likely to stay in GPE has present gap power and a fair amount of physical projection. ,1
"PERSON's massive raw power and frame drew comparisons to PERSON and garnered him a $950,000 bonus as a supplemental first-round pick in 2012. He homered three times in his first five pro games but has battled injuries and strikeout issues since.PERSON's bat speed and strength allow him to hit balls farther than most players. His very long arms create good leverage but also give him a very long swing. He's not going to realize his power potential unless he can make more contact, do a better job of recognizing pitches and learn to solve breaking balls.Though PERSON has below-average speed, he moves well around the first-base bag. He still has work to do defensively after leading high Class A ORGANIZATION first basemen with 19 errors, more any player made at that position in any league in 2014.",0
"One of four international shortstops to get a bonus of at least $750,000 from the ORGANIZATION during the 2014-15 international signing period, PERSON landed $1 million out of GPE. Because he was the oldest of the group, GPE pushed him the most aggressively, but he struggled to solve low Class A pitching in 2016. He has looked much more comfortable at the plate after returning to the LOCATION League this season.The ORGANIZATION handed PERSON a seven-figure bonus in part because they believed he had a higher offensive ceiling than most shortstops. He squares up a lot of balls with a sound left-handed swing and has a patient approach. He has some sneaky power and could be a double-digit home run threat once he adds some strength to his skinny frame.PERSON has plus speed and already possesses basestealing instincts. He has the tools to be a solid defender at either shortstop or second base, though he's erratic and must improve his consistency. He has a strong arm but doesn't always show it unless he has to.",0
"PERSON was a big name out of high school, reportedly turning down seven figures to go to PERSON knowing he would be an eligible sophomore due to his age. He had an up-and-down sophomore spring. PERSON came out of the chute blazing hot and had top-10 pick buzz for the first month of the season, then slowly regressed. PERSON thought he needed a delivery adjustment in to make him more direct to the plate, a way to improve his fastball control. They also thought he was too reliant on his curveball. To that point, hitters late in the season would sit on the pitch, knowing he had trouble locating his fastball and that he barely threw his changeup. It led to some bad outings, including one at GPE where he allowed 11 runs. 
Since being drafted, PERSON has worked more frequently with all three of his pitches, throwing 66% of his pitches for strikes, and his velocity has remained in the 92-94 range even as he throws every fifth day (mostly) rather than once a week. He could end up with three above-average pitches and be a No. 4 or No. 4/5 starter.",0
"The FACILITY snagged one of the best power hitters available in both the 2016 and 2017 Drafts, spending first-round picks on catcher PERSON and PERSON. The latter bashed 21 homers (second in ORGANIZATION Division I) as a sophomore and 22 (en route to winning PERSON player of the year honors) as a junior last spring, becoming the first PERSON hitter ever taken in the first round. Signed for $3.7 million, he had little trouble adjusting to low Class A pitching in his pro debut but missed all of 2018 after rupturing his left Achilles tendon while running out a grounder in February and then tearing it a second time while rehabbing in May.Because he's a stocky right-handed slugger with some arm bar in his swing, PERSON draws comparisons to former GPE third baseman PERSON. With his strength and solid bat speed, he could produce 25 or more homers annually, though he needs to make adjustments to hit more balls in the air after posting a 1.5 groundout/airout ratio in his first taste of pro ball. With his patient approach and ability to make consistent contact, he should hit for average as well as power.PERSON isn't the most graceful athlete but gets the job done in all phases of the game, making him sort of a corner-infield version of PERSON. He's quicker than he looks, displaying average speed out of the batter's box and decent range at third base. With a solid arm, reliable hands and a strong work ethic, he should be able to stick at the hot corner.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 28, 2017 - PERSON, Fla.Favorite MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON has played the guitar, piano and saxophone since he was six years old and accomplished his goal of being fluent in GPE Chinese after studying the language for four years. While PERSON is impressive off the field, his accomplishments on the diamond are just as tremendous. The shortstop, who committed to PERSON, made the 2013 14U ORGANIZATION NTDP roster, earned a 2015 ORGANIZATION, appeared in the 2015 ORGANIZATION, participated in the 2016 PG All-American PERSON, was invited to the 2016 ORGANIZATION and earned a 2016 ORGANIZATION Second Team honor.While PERSON makes his mark in the infield, he has practiced alongside his favorite player, legendary pitcher PERSON, before the Winter Haven games when the Indians still trained at the facility. The eight-time All-Star became both a friend and a role model for the youngster.At the plate, PERSON boasts a solid frame with a thick lower half. He has a slight uppercut with his swing but he makes consistent contact and looks comfortable pulling the ball. In the field, he shows adequate defensive actions and intriguing athleticism.",0
"PERSON is a superb talent who can't help but take max-effort swings at just about everything. His approach and early-career maturity issues (which have improved but still exist) slowed his development a bit and he only has half a season at Double-A despite being 23 and having played pro ball for six seasons. But PERSON has great bat speed, power, and an innate feel for impacting the bottom of the baseball and lifting it into the air. If he weren't so aggressive (he appeared to be under a mandate to see more pitches in 2018) he'd be an easy plus future hit, plus future power center field prospect in the middle of our top 100. But the volatility created by the impatience, combined with PERSON's noticeably thicker 2018 frame, has created apprehension. His upside is huge, but so is the risk. Ultimately, he shares many traits with Phillies outfielder PERSON (though PERSON's a better defender by a wide margin), and, like PERSON, PERSON might just be such an amazing offensive talent that he'll be fine eventually despite his issues and several developmental bumps in the road.  ",0
" Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in 2013, PERSON made his professional debut the next year in the ORGANIZATION. His performance and tools stood out in the league, leaving scouts optimistic about his considerable upside. He has continued to excel after coming to the GPE in 2015.PERSON is an excellent athlete and has impressive physical tools. He has an advanced approach at the plate and projects to be able to hit for average and power as he physically matures. He has well above-average speed and covers a lot of ground in the outfield. His strong arm will help him man a corner outfield position if he loses a step as he gets older, but he has a good chance to remain in center. PERSON understandably is still raw and learning to harness his physical ability. He's a long way away, but he already has given evaluators reason to be excited about the kind of player he could become.",1
"PERSON had PERSON surgery in July and will miss most of 2018, if not all of it. He's also a reliever with lots of effort in his delivery. Once you get past those two things, there's only good news: he sits 97-100 and hits 102 mph, his slider is regularly plus to plus-plus and he's developed a changeup that's also plus. The rare plus three pitch mix and enough command to have some idea where those pitches are going makes him a near unicorn. Also, the surgery is less risky when you only need the guy to be healthy for 6 years, throwing 20-30 pitches at a time. Look for PERSON to deliver on his first round pedrigree as an elite reliever for the Sox in 2019, with the upside of one of the top 5 relievers in the game.",0
"The way PERSON has pitched in 2013, it's somewhat curious why he wasn't the school's Friday starter from the start of the season. Regardless, he's pitched like one, showing a three-pitch mix and the ability to throw strikes with all three.PERSON's fastball will touch 93-94 mph and it has some late sink to it, giving him the ability to generate ground-ball outs. When he stays on top of his breaking ball, it's a solid curve with good tilt to it. He doesn't throw his changeup much, and it needs some work, but it has the chance to be a third average offering.Tall and strong, PERSON may not be among the elite-level college arms in this class, but he may not be too far behind.",1
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $2 million just before the 2015 ORGANIZATION calendar turned over, then traded him to GPE for PERSON a few months later. In his pro debut, PERSON was a force of nature at Low-A before his in-game power tapered off after promotion to Hi-A Buies Creek. PERSON does have plus raw power and good feel to hit with a swing that has enough natural loft that scouts thihnk he'll hit for contact and power. That may take an adjustment that gets PERSON hitting the ball in the air more often, but the hope is that he just starts doing that naturally without mechanical compromise. PERSON looks athletic and fleet-footed enough to play an outfield corner right now but he's already a massive 225 pounds at a age 20 and will probably end up at first base. He has the physical capability to mash enough for first and his first season was encouraging. If the feel for airborne contact starts coming, he could move way up this list during the summer.",1

However, now, PERSON is a Draft prospect with high potential based on his 2015 ORGANIZATION, appearance in the 2015 Breakthrough Series and 2016 ORGANIZATION Second Team honor. At the plate, PERSON looks to use the entire field. The medium-framed outfielder has an athletic build, a medium length swing and an uppercut finish. He puts balls in play and has extra-base power. Coming out of the box, he gets down to first base in 4.22 seconds. In the field, PERSON has an average arm and with practice, should continue to improve upon taking more consistent routes to fly balls.",0
"After a year of sitting 90-94, GPE's fastball velocity fluctuated pretty significantly both start-to-start and within individual games, often resting in the upper-80s like it did while he was in college. But he was also up to 95 at times, even reaching back for that kind of heat late in his starts. Some of the drop in velocity may have been artificial, a result of GPE working more on sinking and cutting his fastball rather than just throwing it hard. He's a plus on-mound athlete who we anticipate will be a sinker/changeup No. 4 or 5 starter relatively soon. His season ended in mid-July due to an oblique strain.",0
" It's rare for a top high school right-hander out of GPE to be described as projectable, but it's a label that fits PERSON well. He has already seen his velocity jump in the past year, and scouts think he can make more gains, thanks to his long, lanky frame. PERSON's fastball now sits in the low 90s and can touch 95 mph, with good life. He has also made strides with his slider and shows an improving feel for his changeup. He repeats his easy delivery well and throws a lot of strikes as a result. PERSON earns praise for his makeup and intelligence.",0
"PERSON was selected sixth overall out of a ORGANIZATION high school in 2014, and was among the most celebrated prep bats of all time. He ranked at the top of his class for three years and was projected to move from catcher to right field because of his prodigious talent at the plate, like PERSON and PERSON before him. He had a tough pro debut with unlucky injuries, streaky hitting, and poor coaching, which he responded poorly to in turn, bristling at the criticism that came with not meeting expectations. PERSON was traded to the ORGANIZATION, who moved him back behind the plate in an attempt to build some value since his bat no longer profiled as the 6 hit/6 power that was projected out of high school. He made great strides as a catcher in 2018 and now looks likely to be an average-or-close-to-it receiver with a plus arm and plus plus raw power. He's gotten much bigger since high school and isn't a runner, and his lessened twitch quickness also makes him more of a mistake hitter at the plate. PERSON being near MLB-ready and given the current state of catching, he could be a 90 wRC+ hitter and fringe-to-average receiver and have a long career. There's a chance for more, but expectations have settled right around there.",1
"PERSON PERSON surgery sank PERSON's 2018 season and he's now a 25-year-old who has yet to pitch a meaningful slate of innings above A-ball. He also only throws in the low-90s/upper-80s, but he locates it in spots that make it difficult for hitters to punish, and his funky, low-3/4s arm slot disorients them, especially lefties. His delivery, fastball command, and ability to dump his curveball in for strikes should be enough for him to deal with lefties and PERSON's best pitch, a late-sinking, bat-missing changeup, could be enough to keep righties at bay. The report reads like a that of fifth starter, a 40 FV. But PERSON's age and what might be an innings limit coming off of surgery are at odds with one another, and ideally we'd like a pitcher firmly in his mid-20s to be a big league lock for 2019, so we've shaded down his FV beneath his true evaluation.",0
"PERSON signed for a lot of money ($4.5 million) and amid a lot of controversy in February 2012. He presented a different birthdate than he had previously, a move that some clubs believed was designed to free him from the international bonus restrictions arising from the new Collective Bargaining Agreement. MLB eventually decided that it couldn't determine his birthdate, allowing the ORGANIZATION to keep him but also suspending him until July 2013.PERSON has barely played as a pro, breaking the hamate bone in his left hand 17 games into his debut last summer. He'll need plenty of polish and time to develop, but he also possesses the two tools every team looks for in a right fielder. He has above-average power, thanks to his bat speed and the leverage in his swing, and a cannon for an arm.PERSON will need to make some adjustments at the plate, where his long swing and pull-happy approach hamper his abilty to make consistent contact. He runs well for a big man and should be at least an average defender.",0
"An exceptionally athletic, twitchy and lean high school catching prospect, PERSON is a potential plus defender with a plus arm and visible leadership qualities. He also has a chance to grow into above average raw power, but scouts aren't sure if he's going to hit.",1
"PERSON has targeted athletes in trades and in the draft and PERSON is one. Though thick and sqaure, PERSON has some twitch to him and is an average runner. But the carrying tool here is the power. PERSON is a strong, right-handed-hitting thumper who was the conference player of the year before PERSON took him in the 2019 draft's third round. He had a big first summer in pro ball, slugging over .500 and averaging an exit velocity of 91mph on balls in play. He's playing center but will probably move to a corner. There may be enough power here for PERSON to profile anyway, at least as a platoon option.",0
"PERSON burst onto the scouting scene in 2013 when, as a junior in high school, he hit 96 mph and flashed an above average curveball at the heavily-scouted ORGANIZATION tournament in GPE, ORGANIZATION. He mostly held serve in his senior year, occasionally touching a tick or two higher or flashing 60 with his curveball, but was still a stuff over command type. The ORGANIZATION went well overslot to get PERSON in the sixth round with a $1 million bonus, below what his talent was worth, but appropriate since clubs knew he needed PERSON surgery right after he signed. 
He's slowly made progress in terms of starter traits during his pro career, while his velocity has increased to where he sits 95-98 mph now. In 2018, he took the biggest step forward, dominating High-A and Double-A at age 22, and some scouts are now projecting him as a No. 2 or 3 starter. We still aren't completely convinced, as PERSON is still control over command, and may fit best in a multi-inning relief role, or as a starter who doesn't face any hitters a third time. ",1
"Up until the 2018 season, PERSON had hit at every point in his career. He parlayed a career .348 average and .469 on-base percentage into an eighth-round selection by the ORGANIZATION in the 2015 ORGANIZATION, then led the GPE League in doubles (27) and ORGANIZATION (.451) and finished second in batting (.354) in his pro debut. He posted a .305 average the next year in his full-season debut, which he followed with a .290 average and .389 ORGANIZATION in 2017 while reaching Double-A. Returning to the LOCATION in 2018, PERSON struggled at the plate for the first time in his career, slashing .231/.328/.363 in 87 games at ORGANIZATION. PERSON has used a contact-first approach to hit .311 in his pro career heading into the 2018 season, while his strike zone discipline is also advanced, leading to a .413 on-base percentage as well. Right now he is all about line drives to the gaps from the left side of the plate, but he does have close to average raw power that his approach doesn't let him get to. The ORGANIZATION will continue to work with PERSON on small mechanical changes to try to tap into that pop a little, though he'll always be hit over power. He doesn't look pretty behind the plate and needs to continue to work on his receiving and game-calling, but he manages to get the job done, throwing out nearly 31 percent of would-be basestealers in his career.The ORGANIZATION are confident he can stick behind the plate, and left-handed hitting backstops are always a hot commodity, at least as backups. If he can continue to hit and find a way to add a little power, he might outperform those projections.",0
"GPE spent his first three seasons at FACILITY coming out of the bullpen before sliding into the starting rotation as a senior. He took well to the new role, showing improved pitchability and control, so much so that the D-backs made GPE their 14th-round pick that June before signing him for $5,000. He garnered All-Star honors as a reliever in the ORGANIZATION in his pro debut, posting a 1.09 ERA over 25 appearances, then opened his first full season as a member of Class A Advanced PERSON's starting rotation. GPE stands out most for his ability to execute a low- to mid-90s sinker that he used to induce groundballs at near 68-percent clip in his pro debut. That combination of velocity and heavy life makes him difficult to barrel, let alone take deep. While scouts tend to prefer his curveball to his slider, they also generally agree that the latter has room to improve. GPE rounds out his four-pitch mix with a fading changeup in the mid-80s that he throws to both sides of the plate. As a physically durable right-hander who generates a lot of weak grounders and is generally around the zone, GPE has many of the components needed to stick as a starter. That he's still relatively new to starting gives him untapped potential in the role, too, and the hope is that he'll begin to miss more bats as he refines his secondary pitches.",0
"PERSON's lack of arm strength really boxes him in at second base, which means he has to hit enough to be a regular there because defensive versatility, and therefore a viable utility role, isn't part of his profile. Much of the pressure will be on the bat to ball skills as PERSON is a compact guy with average bat speed. He probably needs to be a 60 bat or better to play every day, which is feasible considering that his attributes, dating back to high school, are lead by a short swing and barrel control. He's off to a good start in 2019, walking nearly as much as he has struck out.",0
"PERSON popped up at the same event as PERSON late in the summer, with an even louder performance, but his swing has gotten a little stiffer and some scouts think he's a left fielder.",0
"Revered as one of the 2014 PERSON's premier athletes, PERSON was set to pursue a career in both baseball and football at ORGANIZATION before the ORGANIZATION offered him nearly $700,000 over slot value as their second-round pick. Although a grim ankle injury prematurely ended his first full season and a broken hamate limited him the following year, a fully healthy PERSON blossomed in 2017, earning PERSON All-Star honors before advancing to the ORGANIZATION. He finished the season with 21 home runs and 27 stolen bases over 122 games between the two levels, and then firmly put himself on the ORGANIZATION radar with a standout campaign in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's breakout caught the attention of the ORGANIZATION, and they acquired him with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON for PERSON in January.PERSON might have the loudest tools in GPE's system. He generates plus raw power to all fields thanks to a combination of physical strength and plus bat speed that enables him to turn around velocity. That power does come with some strikeout concerns, as PERSON's swing will get too long at times and he'll struggle to recognize spin, causing him to expand his zone. PERSON's plus speed makes him a basestealing threat as well as an above-average defender, either in center field or in right, where his cannon for an arm is a clean fit.PERSON offered a taste of his potential during his breakout 2017 campaign, and the ORGANIZATION are justifiably excited about what the future may hold for their new outfielder. If he can stay healthy, PERSON could develop into a perennial 20/20 player who also offers considerable value with his defense.",0
"Signed for $995,000 as an 11th-round pick in 2009, PERSON never really got going offensively in the ORGANIZATION system with the exception of winning the high Class A ORGANIZATION League batting title with a .313 average in 2013. After he slumped again in 2014, PERSON sold him to the ORGANIZATION this February. He has performed well in Double-A for his new organization, creating hope that he could contribute as backup catcher in the big leagues.When PERSON keeps his right-handed swing from getting too long and doesn't try to pull everything, he can be effective at the plate. He has some pop and draws his share of walks. PERSON has made himself into a decent receiver and has an average arm. He's bigger than most catchers at 6-foot-5, which can hamper his efforts to block pitches in the dirt.",0
"PERSON has an NBA shooting guard build at a long-limbed 6-foot-5. He towers over almost all of his peers and has rare physical projection. He might grow elite raw power, though it will be a challenge for him to hit due to his lever length. Hitters like this often don't develop viable hit tools until they're well into their mid-twenties. PERSON may take another five years to develop a playable hit tool, but as long as the power develops, he'll get getting chances to learn how to make contact.",0
"It might seem like PERSON has been on prospect radars for an eternity, having signed out of the ORGANIZATION back in 2007. Yet when he made his big league debut in 2014, he was still just 23 years old.It was PERSON' glove that carried him to the big leagues and it's likely what will keep him there. The infielder is very sure-handed, making every routine play and then some. He has a very accurate, above-average arm. In addition to playing a very solid shortstop, he's shown an ability to handle defensive responsibilities at second and third to increase his versatility and value. PERSON has made strides offensively. While he's never going to be a force with the bat, he's learned that he can contribute by getting on base and putting the ball in play consistently. PERSON played exceptionally well in the ORGANIZATION Winter League, realizing he doesn't have to try to do too much at the plate to succeed. He moved all around the infield there, as well, setting himself up for a career as a super-utility type.",1
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 4, 2017 - PERSON, Calif.Favorite MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON commit PERSON was invited to PERSON's inaugural Scouting PERSON game back in 2015 and was selected as a 2015 ORGANIZATION and a 2016 ORGANIZATION in the last two years. PERSON participated in the 2016 ORGANIZATION and made two All-Tournament Teams since 2015. Finally, PERSON won the 2014 PG/Evoshield National Championship with his travel team, ORGANIZATION. Scouts have said that PERSON has shown a decent swing and some bat speed, paired with arm strength on defense.",0
"Recruited as a middle infielder by PERSON, PERSON wound up starting up behind the plate for the ORGANIZATION and has seen extensive action at both spots since signing for $95,000 as a ninth-round pick. The nephew of former big leaguer PERSON went from the ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION in a seven-player December deal that sent All-Star Dee PERSON to GPE.PERSON focuses on making contact and using the middle of the field, an approach that has helped him hit for average throughout the ORGANIZATION. He walked more than he struck out in his first four pro seasons and projects as a high on-base percentage guy with improving power. He runs better than most catchers and has good instincts on the bases.He's a reliable defender with soft hands at both catcher and second base (which he played regularly in GPE's system). Though he doesn't have PERSON's power or offensive upside, PERSON has better catch-and-throw skills. His unusual defensive versatility would lend itself to a career as a utilityman if he can't cut it as a regular.",0
"PERSON passed on signing with the ORGANIZATION as a 17th-rounder in 2016 and instead opted to return for his senior season at ORGANIZATION, where he posted a 1.79 ORGANIZATION and 12 saves to finish with the second-most saves (21) in program history. The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their third-round pick in June, and he proved to be far more than just a money-saving senior discount during a stellar pro debut in which he reached full-season ball after signing for $454,800 below slot value.PERSON draws comparisons to PERSON because he's a lanky, side-armed right-hander with two above-average pitches. His combination of a low-90s fastball, that touches 95 mph, and a tight slider makes PERSON highly effective against same-sided hitters, and he's already impressed ORGANIZATION club officials with his ability to throw strikes from his unique slot.As a low-slot reliever who features both velocity and control, PERSON has the potential to jump on the fast track to the ORGANIZATION in his first full season.",0
" The ORGANIZATION challenged PERSON after signing him out of the ORGANIZATION in 2012 and he was the youngest position player in the ORGANIZATION in 2014. The 18-year old caught the attention of scouts as he held his own against the more experienced competition. He was a key piece in the ORGANIZATION deal that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON has a disciplined approach at the plate, showing a willingness to work the count. He already shows some power thanks to his quick wrists and he could be a solid hitter if he can continue to improve his pitch recognition. PERSON like PERSON' present defensive skills, especially his arm strength and hands. He is only an average runner, however, and could end up moving to second or third base if he loses a step as he physically matures.",1
"A year ago, a high school third baseman in LOCATION gained some helium and ended up going in the second round to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON might not be quite at the same level that PERSON was in 2013, but there are some similarities in terms of his position and moving up boards as the GPE approached.PERSON can make consistent contact to all fields and hasn't seen a fastball he can't punish. He has strength and bat speed that should lead to plenty of power in the future. Running is not a part of his game, but he has the tools and actions to stick at the hot corner, highlighted by a very strong throwing arm. PERSON plays the game hard, with an aggressive approach. The team taking him, perhaps as early as the third round, could be getting a bargain in the process.",0
"In his first year and change in the ORGANIZATION system, PERSON pitched out of the bullpen. The next two seasons, he got a chance to start. In all instances, the lefty out of GPE has had success, despite an array of fringy stuff that says he shouldn't be knocking on the big league door.On paper, PERSON shouldn't be in the mix to contribute. His fastball sits in the upper-80s. His changeup and cutter are PERSON average and he has a fringy slider he mixes in effectively. He's a rare southpaw who has a knuckleball, but he doesn't throw it very often. What PERSON does do is command all of his pitches to both sides of the plate exceptionally well. He adds and subtracts, mixes his pitches well and works quickly, so fielders love playing behind him.Take 100 pitchers with PERSON's stuff and at least 90 of them don't even make the upper levels of a system. PERSON's competitiveness and smarts on the mound, however, have him bucking the odds, with a chance to be a lefty swingman or No. 5 starter in the future.",0
" d'Arnaud has been snakebitten the past two years by knee injuries that have prevented him from graduating to the big leagues. He finally made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in GPE and quickly took over as the ORGANIZATION starting catcher. The ORGANIZATION originally drafted d'Arnaud before trading him to the ORGANIZATION as a part of the ORGANIZATION Halladay deal. He was then traded to the ORGANIZATION in December 2012 as a part of the package for ORGANIZATION. When healthy, d'Arnaud has the tools to be a top-flight all-around backstop. He's agile and athletic with a good arm and has worked hard to improve his throwing. He has the ability to hit for both average and power and is a natural leader behind the plate.",1
"PERSON rebounded from winning one game as a sophomore at ORGANIZATION to earning ORGANIZATION pitcher-of-the-year honors as a junior in 2014. Signed for $576,100 as a third-round pick, the ORGANIZATION' highest in a decade, he pitched well in high Class A during his first full pro season and would have been promoted to Double-A in July had he not sustained an oblique injury. He got there in 2016 and bolstered his reputation as one of the ORGANIZATION' most polished starting pitching prospects.His 6-foot-7 frame has prompted comparisons to PERSON since PERSON was in high school, but he's skinnier and more about finesse than missing bats. He has better body control than most tall pitchers, allowing him to repeat his mechanics and locate three average pitches within the strike zone. He does a good job of using his size and high three-quarters delivery to leverage his pitches down in the zone and gave up just four homers in 107 1/3 innings during his first two years as a pro.Though PERSON lacks a plus offering, his 88-92 mph fastball plays above its velocity because he gets great extension in his delivery. His mid-70s curveball and fading changeup are reliable if not overpowering. He won't ever lead the ORGANIZATION in strikeouts like PERSON did last year, but PERSON could pitch in the back end of a big league rotation.",0
" Why do scouts like PERSON? Let's start with the fact that some evaluators believe he might have the best all-around swing in the entire class. The 6-foot, 160-pounder has good hands, strong wrists and the quick-twitch action in the batter's box that scouts love. PERSON also has good bat control, plate discipline and a fluid swing that reminds some people of a young PERSON Green.The broad-shouldered teenager has gap power and the ability to drive the ball to the opposite field. PERSON has good footwork on defense, but it's unclear if he has the overall skill set to stay at shortstop. Scouts have also praised his makeup and athleticism.One scout said PERSON could be the steal of the class based on his swing alone. PERSON is from GPE, GPE, and is trained by former ORGANIZATION infielder PERSON at the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION are the favorites to land PERSON.",0
" GPE to sign as a 16-year-old GPE in July 2011, PERSON had to wait more than three years before the ORGANIZATION gave him a $10,000 bonus in December 2014. He has enjoyed consistent success since turning pro, posting a 2.87 ERA while reaching PERSON in his first three seasons. His fastball continues to improve, repeatedly touching 99 mph in each of his starts during the last three months of 2017, maxing out at 102. The ORGANIZATION liked his stuff enough to get him as part of the trade that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in late July. PERSON's heater sat at 93-95 mph during his 2016 GPE debut and operated at 95-98 last year. He has life on his fastball too, though he doesn't miss as many bats as expected yet because the quality of his secondary pitches fluctuates. His upper-80s slider and low-80s curveball are more notable for their velocity than their bite and can get slurvy at times, while his changeup can get too firm. PERSON does show aptitude for making adjustments, so there is belief he can remain a starter. His control and command also need refinement, but he's making progress in both areas. If he does wind up in the bullpen, he has closer potential and could regularly hit 100 mph in shorter stints.",0
"PERSON racked up 40 saves during his four years at ORGANIZATION and dominated for two summers on the Cape before signing with the ORGANIZATION as a 10th-round pick in 2017. He's enjoyed similar success in the professional ranks so far and began to move quickly in 2018, ascending three levels to reach Double-A in his first full season. The ORGANIZATION assigned him to Triple-A to open 2019, though early struggles in the ORGANIZATION led to a demotion back to Double-A Binghamton in June. PERSON' fastball is below-average from a velocity standpoint, sitting mostly in the upper 80s, but he consistently gets it past hitters thanks to deception created by his low arm slot. Said slot gives his effective slider broad sweeping action, while his changeup drops off the table as it approaches the plate. The change is the better secondary offering, one that receives above-average grades from scouts, and was instrumental in him holding left-handed hitters to a .167/.254/.294 clip in 2018. He's an adept strike-thrower with all three pitches, demonstrating above-average control and command against hitters on both sides of the plate.But perhaps what's most intriguing about PERSON is that he can induce whiffs with relative ease. Working 66 2/3 innings in his first full season, he struck out 37 percent of the hitters he faced while averaging 13 strikeouts-per-nine. PERSON doesn't fit into a neat box as a big league reliever, but there's something to be said about his sustained dominance, and it would surprise no one in the organization if he continued his accelerated climb towards the Majors.",0
"Built like a one of the moai sculptures on PERSON, PERSON faces size-based questions about his ability to catch long term. But he has a plus arm, he's procedurally advanced for a 20-year-old, and he has the leadership qualities and intangibles that have an outsized impact at catcher. He also has plus power, enough to put balls out to right center, though PERSON' current approach to contact doesn't often enable it. He pulls just about everything. 
PERSON' future is heavily dependent on him staying behind the plate and ideally, he'd catch more than just 33 games (last year's total at an affiliate, not including extended) throughout the course of this year, and show that the workload doesn't detract from his bat or agility. The power gives him a shot to be a regular, though a backup role is probably more likely.",0
"Most college shortstops have to move to a less challenging position in pro ball. That won't be an issue with PERSON, who was billed as arguably the top defensive shortstop in the 2015 Draft class before going No. 20 overall to the A's and signing for $1.95 million. PERSON's first full pro season began ominously, though, as it was announced in early April that PERSON would be forced to miss the first six weeks of the season after undergoing knee surgery to repair a torn meniscus. PERSON's impressive range is a product of his athleticism and plus speed, and scouts rave about his first-step quickness as well as his overall instincts. His arm is a clean fit at shortstop and enables him to make highlight-reel plays, but he can also get rid of the ball quickly while on the move without sacrificing accuracy. PERSON has a tendency to make errors when he tries to do too much, though he did settle down and displayed improved tempo and body control in 2015.A disciplined hitter with good bat-to-ball skills, PERSON is at his best when he's spraying line drives to the opposite field. He does have a tendency to get tied up and roll the ball over to the left side, however, and his simple, low-effort swing prevents him from utilizing his limited power. Even if the bat doesn't pan out, PERSON's glove alone could make him an everyday shortstop at the highest level.",0
"PERSON was a potential second-round pick last year as a sophomore-eligible at ORGANIZATION but went unpicked after a shoulder injury sidelined him for the entire season. He didn't require surgery and has bounced back so well this spring that he's a likely second-rounder and figures to be the first college choice from the state of GPE. The 2016 Conference USA pitcher of the year, he led Division I with 143 strikeouts in 106 innings entering the ORGANIZATION tournament.PERSON has regained his 91-96 mph fastball and maintains it deep into games. His heater is tough not only because of its velocity, but also because his extension in the front of his delivery makes it appear faster and it features run and sink. His power curveball can be a plus pitch when he stays on top of it but gets slurvy at times, and he has aptitude for throwing a sinking changeup.Though PERSON has an athletic, physical frame that should lend itself to starting, there are questions about his long-term durability because of his shoulder issues and the track record of top Owls pitching prospects getting hurt. His layoff didn't help his control and command, but he has a sound delivery and they should be at least average in the long run.",0
" When PERSON had been on the mound as an amateur, scouts liked what they saw. But they didn't get to see him pitch much because of injuries, as the lefty missed his first two years at the ORGANIZATION of GPE following PERSON surgery and then couldn't find a role as a junior in 2016 until he threw a gem in an ORGANIZATION semifinal. The ORGANIZATION liked what they saw enough to roll the dice and take him in fourth round of that year's PERSON and he's responded with a solid first pro season.Pitching more than he has in years, PERSON has been working largely with an average fastball, though he's shown he can touch 94-95 in shorter stints, and the ORGANIZATION are interested to see if that comes back the more he adjusts to pitching consistently. PERSON can elicit swings and misses with his slider, but while he has a changeup, he hasn't always been able to show a feel for it. His command has improved the more he's pitched and he has a solid delivery and arm action. Because of how much time PERSON missed in college, the ORGANIZATION are treating the lefty more like a high school or junior college pitcher in terms of his development. If he can continue to pitch like he did in his first full season, the kid gloves will eventually come off.",0
"PERSON improved in each of his three years at ORGANIZATION, earning Big GPE All-Conference honors as a junior. The ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the 12th round that June, signing him for $150,000. He's done nothing but produce as a pro, using his blend of hitting ability, speed and defense to move quickly through the ORGANIZATION' system. He was a ORGANIZATION All-Star in his first full season and played just five games at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Lakeland at the outset of 2018 before advancing to Double-A, where he was an LOCATION All-Star and produced a .317 average with 23 steals. After the season, PERSON continued to boost his prospect stock with a strong turn in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON has a good feel for what he's doing at the plate. His approach is geared toward hitting the ball back up the middle, and he does so often using a short left-handed swing. While PERSON's contact is mostly of the ground-ball variety, it actually plays into his strength because he's a plus-plus runner with well-below-average power. PERSON is a skilled bunter, with the ability to lay it down either line, and he's an aggressive, sometimes over-aggressive basestealer. He fared better against same-sided arms (.340 average) than righties (.301) in Double-A. PERSON's wheels enable him to play center field, and he's seen significant time at all three outfield spots in full-season ball. That versatility, along with his speed and bat, give PERSON a clear path to the Majors as a fourth outfielder.",0
"PERSON was a lightly-scouted multi-sport high school athlete in GPE who also played hockey before he arrived at the ORGANIZATION of GPE. Soon after he stepped on campus, scouts saw and become enamored with the enomrous athletic potential he had. He still hasn't quite tapped into it, at least on offense. PERSON has 70 speed and defensive ability in center field, along with a 60 arm and average raw power. As a 6-foot-4, 210 pound athletic specimen, he'll probably play forever. There's some bat control and feel for oppo gap contact here, but PERSON's approach and feel for hitting is lacking, holding back his everyday potential. Most scouts project him as a good fourth outfielder in the ORGANIZATION mold.",0
"After PERSON's very strong showing in the ORGANIZATION last summer, scouts were very excited to see him in action as a junior at ORGANIZATION. A groin injury kept him out the first month of the season, but upon his return, PERSON became a popular destination for scouts. PERSON led the ORGANIZATION' starting rotation this spring with a 6-1 record and 3.10 ERA in 10 starts, during which he fanned 74 batters in 69 2/3 innings. The ORGANIZATION made him their first-round pick, taking him 21st overall, and then signed him for $2.175 million, slightly under slot value for the pick.PERSON has a four-pitch mix, and all of the pitches are thrown with steep angle from his 6-foot-7 frame that could add more strength. He uses a relatively easy delivery to fire fastballs that have touched 96-97 mph since his return. He'll sit in the 92-94 mph range, and his fastball has good run and sink to it. PERSON will use both a slider and a curve effectively, with his breaking stuff occasionally flashing plus, though it's been inconsistent. He tinkers with a changeup in the bullpen but doesn't have a ton of feel for it and doesn't use it much in games. He throws strikes with all of his offerings.Whether PERSON reaches his ceiling will come down to the development of his secondary pitches -- in particular his changeup, which will be crucial for him in terms of neutralizing left-handed hitters. He will also need to learn to differentiate between his slider and curveball, though that might happen organically as he faces more advanced hitters.",0
"PERSON was one of the best players on the summer showcase circuit in 2016, showing a rare combo of hit, power and speed tools, though it was unclear if he fit better in the infield or center field. He had an up and down spring for his high school, but the raw tools were still present, helping him go #1 overall in a year without a clearcut top prospect. PERSON still largely think PERSON' tools play best in center field long-term and he performed even better than expected in his pro debut.",0
"PERSON is everything you want from a pitcher: size, stuff and feel for pitching.A PERSON All-Star back in 2011, PERSON pitched in ORGANIZATION's rotation last year and helped anchor it as the Saturday starter in 2013. He'll hit 94 mph with his fastball, and he has a good curve and changeup to go along with it to give him a good three-pitch mix that he knows how to use effectively.There is some question about his arm action, but the real concern might be about his medical record. PERSON had labrum surgery as a senior in high school and any team interested in him in June will have to be convinced of his durability.The PERSON of the Year in 2011 didn't go back there in 2012, resting up to try and improve on his sophomore season that saw him go 5-3 with a 3.83 ERA in 17 starts for ORGANIZATION.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 28, 2017 - PERSON, Fla.Favorite MLB Team: PERSON FACILITY MLB Player: PERSON was chosen as a 2015 ORGANIZATION and a 2016 ORGANIZATION First Teamer while also participating in the 2016 ORGANIZATION. PERSON, a top 500 recruit, is committed to the ORGANIZATION Trojans.The lanky southpaw has lots of ability to work with. He has a loose arm but creates some deception with his long length and three-quarter arm slot, and he can dial his fastball up to 90 mph.While PERSON is still working on his throwing mechanics, further development should help improve his control and offspeed stuff. He has a chance to succeed as a starter if he puts all the full package of skills together.",0
" | Overall:4/5  Coming from a cold-weather climate in GPE, scouts were running to see PERSON in high school in the days leading up to the GPE, and his strong performances in his senior season allowed him to go in the second round. While he's not the tallest right-hander in the world, he's very strong and durable. He can run his fastball up to 94 mph and spin a very good curveball, and even has a good feel for a changeup. PERSON will also mix in a good cutter, giving him the chance to have four Major League average or better pitches in the future. Like many young pitchers, he'll need to refine his command, but that's not a long-term concern, as he gets high grades for his mound presence and work ethic.",0
"PERSON ORGANIZATION has had its fair share of draftees, PERSON being by far the most successful, but only seven have been taken in the top three rounds of the regular Draft in June. PERSON is the latest player to have joined that exclusive list after the PERSON made him their third-round pick in 2017.A product of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks, PERSON's 6-foot-4 frame and plus fastball garnered plenty of attention in the spring as he regularly bumped 95 mph throughout his starts. He throws two breaking balls, a fringy curveball and a slider that flashes above average. He mixes in a viable changeup as well. PERSON's arm action can get a bit long, making it tougher for him to repeat his delivery. That, in turn, leads to command issues.PERSON's arm strength, durable frame and potential four-pitch mix should allow for his continue development as a starter in pro ball, especially if he can make strides with his control and command. Should that not work out, shortening PERSON up and putting him in the bullpen could allow his fastball-slider combination to play up and get him to the big leagues more quickly.",0
"  A native of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION shortly after his 17th birthday in 2011. He's performed well in three professional seasons since, advancing to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League as a 19-year-old in 2014.  PERSON has an advanced approach at the plate and knows how to put the barrel of the bat on the ball. A switch hitter, he shows off good power from both sides of the plate in batting practice, but employs more of a line-drive approach in games.  PERSON already has a big frame, raising some questions about his future position. He has a strong arm, but a move across the diamond or possibly to an outfield corner is not out of the question. Wherever he ends up defensively, PERSON's bat looks like it'll be good enough to carry him through the ORGANIZATION.",0
"Recruited by PERSON as a two-way player, PERSON saw little action as a pitcher or an infielder as a freshman in 2014. He did, however, experiment with dropping his arm slot, which improved the velocity and life on his fastball. The ORGANIZATION liked the results enough to draft him in the 12th round out of ORGANIZATION (Fla.) JC in 2015 and sign him away from an ORGANIZATION State commitment for $100,000.PERSON worked with a mid-80s fastball from a more conventional three-quarters arm angle. While most pitchers lose velocity when they throw from a lower slot, he saw his fastball jump to 92-94 mph and top out at 97 while at ORGANIZATION. In his third pro season, he was operating at 94-98 mph with quality sink that yields a lot of groundouts before sustaining a slight tear in his trapezius muscle in mid-May.Hitters have trouble squaring up PERSON's sinker when he keeps it down in the zone. He backs it up with a hard, sweeping slider that is quite effective against right-handers. He's having much more success against left-handers in 2017 after they hit him hard in his first two years as a pro, and if he keeps that up, he could start to rise quickly through the Minors.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in December 2013, PERSON has since developed into one of the more accomplished hitters in the ORGANIZATION. The GPE's youngest everyday player on Opening Day in 2016, PERSON went on to win the circuit's batting title and ORGANIZATION award at age 19, and then garnered Double-A ORGANIZATION All-Star honors in 2017 before a standout turn in the prestigious ORGANIZATION. PERSON stands out as much for his approach and plate discipline as he does for his pure hitting ability. He has an advanced knowledge of the strike zone as well as excellent pitch recognition, a combination that netted him the ORGANIZATION's top on-base percentage (.398) in 2017, and has resulted in more walks (153) than strikeouts (135) in four professional seasons. PERSON' bat-to-ball skills are impressive, and he produces hard line drives across the entire field with a compact, level swing. His raw power, meanwhile, is better than his numbers suggest, though PERSON' should be a consistent source of extra-base hits thanks to his knack for pounding the gaps. PERSON has solid arm strength and can get the job done at shortstop, but he offers more upside at second base, where he's a plus defender and has spent the bulk of his pro career.PERSON proved plenty capable at shortstop in 2017, first in Double-A and then in the ORGANIZATION, and should continue to see some time there moving forward. His ultimate defensive home, however, is likely second base, where he profiles as an above-average defender with good range and arm strength. Overall, PERSON has the ingredients to hit atop a lineup while manning a middle-infield position for a long, long time.",1
"If it hadn't been for some struggles in Triple-A and then injuries that shelved him for more than a month, ORGANIZATION likely would have seen some time in GPE in 2012. He had a huge 2011 season that put him firmly on the ""future closers"" map and despite the hiccup in GPE, he still should be there. He'll throw his power sinking fastball up to 97 mph and back it up with a hard slider that has cutter-like action. He'll mix in an occasional changeup for a different look, though it's not really an effective part of his arsenal. He made up for lost time in the ORGANIZATION and looked much more like the ORGANIZATION of old, putting him in line for a big league job soon.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"Projectable left-handed pitchers aren't easy to find in the GPE. The ORGANIZATION feel they have one in PERSON, whom they signed away from an GPE commitment by giving him $775,000, more than $100,000 over the value assigned for the pick in the third round of the 2015 GPE.The North Carolina high school product has the chance to have a three-pitch mix, though there is work to be done. PERSON can run his fastball up to 93 mph at times, and there might be some more in the tank as he matures. His curve is fringy at present, but he knows how to spin it, and it could eventually develop into a solid breaking ball. He has a feel for a changeup, but he didn't thrown it much as an amateur. The biggest issue with PERSON is his delivery, which has some effort and some mechanical flaws that need to be cleaned up. PERSON is strong and fairly athletic, so the ORGANIZATION hope he can make the adjustments necessary to consistently tap into his raw ability on the mound.",0
"PERSON was one of the most explosive talents in the 2018 July 2nd class, getting the second highest bonus at $3.5 million, behind only 22-year-old PERSON center fielder PERSON. PERSON is currently ranked behind a number of players in his class because we still aren't sure how his contact skills will project. He has big bat speed and projects for at least 60 raw power, along with sticking somewhere in the infield. We aren't sure how his body will develop, and thus the raw power and the position where he'll land are open questions. More importantly, he takes a high-effort, torqued-up cut at the ball, and the Jays like that he has eye-hand contact, but there's still a ways to go to turn this intriguing ball of clay into a more finished product.",0
"Thompson-Williams showed enough glimpses of his athleticism translating into production in two years at FACILITY ORGANIZATION and then one season at GPE to get taken in the fifth round of the 2016 Draft by the ORGANIZATION. Things really didn't start clicking for the outfielder until 2018, when he put in a 20-20 season, mostly in the ORGANIZATION State League, and earned a bump up to Double-A for the LOCATION playoffs. The ORGANIZATION had always liked his tools and acquired him in the package for PERSON last November.DTW's power-speed combination has always been intriguing, but it's possible he tried to rely too much on his natural gifts in his first year-plus of pro ball. But he put in the work leading up to the offseason, which led to him producing 22 homers and 20 steals. He has serious raw pop from the left side of the plate, and he can drive the ball to all fields. If he can learn to control the strike zone a bit more consistently, he could make enough contact to have plus game power.Thompson-Williams has played all three outfield positions and has the skills to play center field on a regular basis. A career as a fourth outfielder might be in the offing, but a repeat of his 20-20 breakout could have evaluators projecting more.",0
" PERSON's powerful right arm has enticed scouts since his amateur days in the ORGANIZATION. But he has struggled to harness his stuff and will have to sort out his control issues as he advances in the ORGANIZATION. He was making some strides in the ORGANIZATION State League when he was one of two arms sent to the Phillies in the ORGANIZATION Revere trade.PERSON throws his fastball in the low to mid 90s and is capable of touching 98 mph. His slider and changeup both show promise, though both pitches remain inconsistent. PERSON never has thrown many strikes as a professional. His wildness and smaller frame may make him better suited to be a reliever in the long run, and ORGANIZATION moved him to that role in high Class A in 2015.",0
"Some pitchers wow with arm strength and radar gun readings. Others impress with an advanced knowledge of how to pitch. PERSON fits squarely in the latter category.The PERSON ace may not have a pitch that grades out much better than PERSON average, but he really knows what to do with the three he has. He can touch 93 mph with his fastball, but he usually sits in the 89-91 mph range, adding and subtracting at will. He can throw his curveball for strikes when necessary, and his changeup can serve as a deceptive out pitch. PERSON will continue to refine his command with a smooth delivery that he should be able to repeat consistently. PERSON finished his season with three straight complete-game victories, giving scouts a little glimpse of what he can do as a starter at the next level.",0
"PERSON could be the ORGANIZATION' next success story with converting college relievers into pro starters, following PERSON and the since-traded PERSON. A 2017 fifth-rounder signed for $320,900, he made just four starts in three years at ORGANIZATION, which preferred to use him as a multi-inning reliever. After posting a 1.35 ERA in his brief pro debut, he has missed most of 2018 after surgery to remove a blood clot from his pitching shoulder.As a college reliever and in short pro stints, PERSON sat at 92-95 mph with his fastball and peaked at 97. His spike curveball can be more devastating and also harder to control, combining power and 12-to-6 break. Both PERSON and PERSON added velocity and maintained it over a full season after shifting to the rotation, and if that happens with PERSON he could have a pair of well-above-average pitches.PERSON rarely employed a changeup in college, so adding a reliable third pitch will be a focal point of his development. Improving his control and command are also on his to-do list after he averaged 4.5 walks per nine innings at ORGANIZATION. He has a strong frame and his arm works well, so he should have the durability required to start.",0
"GPE has some of the best feel for contact in the minor leagues and, until recently, was continuing to hit well at Triple-A as a 20/21-year-old. His recent struggles aren't all that concerning and he continues to project to make an elite rate of contact while playing an up-the-middle defensive position.",1
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 21, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON McCutchen A two-sport athlete, PERSON also plays both running back and wide receiver for the LOCATION ORGANIZATION football team. PERSON made his varsity baseball team in 2015 and significantly contributed as both a pitcher and hitter. The live-bodied outfielder flashes exciting tools that are brimming with upside, and he is beginning to refine his raw ability.",0
"  PERSON didn't have a lot of buzz coming into the 2014 GPE, but the PERSON liked his tools and grabbed him in the fourth round.PERSON has a simple swing and does a good job of putting the barrel on the ball. He produces good bat speed, and scouts believe that will translate into power as he physically matures. Though he was announced as a shortstop during the GPE, he primarily played third base during his professional debut. His arm strength, hands and range all profile well at the hot corner. PERSON praise PERSON for his makeup and understanding of the game, two traits that will help him continue to develop as he advances in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON' talent could have landed him in the second round of the 2011 Draft, but his strong commitment to pitch and also kick for the football team at FACILITY dropped him to the 14th round. The ORGANIZATION signed him at the deadline for $2.5 million, still a Draft record for after the third round, then watched him flounder with control issues and minor injuries for his first five pro seasons. He has broken out in 2017, blowing away hitters with three power pitches and finally reaching Double-A.PERSON is throwing better than ever, ranging from 94-100 mph with a fastball that has some run and sink. When it was trying to develop him as a starter, GPE had him concentrate on improving his fastball command, which cost him some feel for his curveball, his best offering as an amateur. His hard downer curve in the lower 80s is back in his arsenal, and he also has developed an upper-80s slider that's even more of a wipeout pitch.Though he's a good athlete, PERSON never has had a pretty delivery and still struggles to find the strike zone. If he can acquire even average control, he could become a closer. While that may be too much to ask, he has the pure stuff to help the ORGANIZATION in the near future.",0
"PERSON pitched out of GPE's bullpen in 2013, then served as the ORGANIZATION' No. 1 starter in 2014 when the team finished second in the ORGANIZATION World Series and featured a first-round pick (PERSON) and two supplemental first-rounders (PERSON, PERSON). Entering the 2015 season as the top college lefty in the GPE class, PERSON's drop in velocity and command issues did concern some and then a lat strain shelved him in GPE, somewhat clouding his GPE status.A GPE high school product who removed himself from the 2012 GPE, PERSON has been up to 94 mph in the past, but was sitting around 89-91 mph this spring, with some saying the dip was because he was throwing too many sliders, a plus pitch. The fastball can play up because of its life and angle and his ability to work it to both sides of the plate and he backs it up with that slider and a solid changeup.PERSON usually fills the strike zone, but was nibbling too much leading to an uptick in his walk rate. Even with that and the injury, his track record, arm strength and stuff should still get him drafted in the first round.",0
"PERSON was sitting in the mid-80s as a rising junior but got himself into excellent physical shape and was touching 97 at showcase events last summer. He has an average curveball, below average changeup and lacks the mechanical grace and fluidity of most of his peers.",0
"The first high school player selected in the 2013 Draft, PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION rather than play football and baseball at FACILITY A&M. His development has been slowed by some arm and shoulder issues, but he appears headed in the right direction, especially after a very strong second half to his 2015 season.That's a good sign, especially since he threw a lot more innings than he had previously in his pro career. On any given day, PERSON will show flashes of four plus pitches. It's just a question of him using them all consistently. He can touch the mid-90s with his fastball, though he'll typically sit in the low-90s with a ton of sink that has produced extreme ground-ball rates. His slider continues to be his better breaking pitch, but he made progress with his curve and is more confident, using it more in strikeout situations. His changeup gives him a fourth, at least, PERSON average offering.There has been some concern about PERSON's low strikeout rate, especially given the quality of his stuff. He's young enough to learn to miss more bats and he'll be just 21 for all of the 2016 season as he attacks the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION' system.",1
"PERSON began his professional career about as well as he possibly could have, and he pitched in the ORGANIZATION Game just a year after being drafted. While he probably won't repeat that level of success, he has all the tools necessary to become a solid Major League starter.PERSON throws his fastball in the mid-90s, occasionally running it up to 98 mph. He commands the pitch well, and he throws it effectively to both sides of the plate. PERSON' changeup and curveball are both solid offerings, but they have room to improve.PERSON has quickly reached the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION, joining a large group of nearly big league-ready starters in the ORGANIZATION's system. That abundance of pitching will give PERSON the time he needs to refine his game as he progresses toward his profile of a middle-of-the-rotation starter.",1
"The way PERSON's jersey billows down from his long, skinny limbs throughout an eccentric, slowly-paced windup makes him look like a backup dancer in some kind of vampire musical. Despite the head whack that comes at the end, he's able to throw strikes with his fastball and has a sufficiently deep repertoire for starting. He is the ORGANIZATION' type, possessing a fastball/curveball combination that plays well in sequence at the top and bottom of the strike zone. The rest of his stuff is just okay but enables PERSON to attack hitters in various ways, either by working his cutter in on the hands of lefties or by dipping his slider beneath the zone. He has a No. 4 or 5 starter's mix or could end up a dynamic multi-inning reliever.",0
" Pitchers who are under-sized right-handers with unusual deliveries will likely be compared to PERSON in perpetuity. It might fit for PERSON, who was able to pitch at two levels, reaching Double-A in 2012 at age 20. PERSON has an exciting repertoire, with the chance to have four pitches (or more) at his disposal. His fastball can be a plus, thrown up to 94 mph with an ability to maintain velocity deep into starts. His tight downer curve should be at least above average, he likes to mix in a very effective cutter, and he'll show a decent slider now and again as well as a solid changeup. He has the kind of attitude you like to see on the mound, the type who likes to prove doubters wrong. He should be ready to show them as a No. 3 type starter in the big leagues in the next year or so.",0
"After emerging as the closer for GPE and the GPE collegiate national team as a sophomore, PERSON missed six weeks with a sore arm during his Draft year in 2017. He continued to excel when healthy, prompting the FACILITY to take him in the fifth round, and he hasn't any problems since. He went 9-0 and converted 14 of his 15 save opportunities in his first full pro season, posting a 1.40 ERA with 89 strikeouts in 58 innings between two Class A stops.PERSON's success almost exclusively results from his fastball, which parks at 92-96 mph and tops out at 98. His heater doesn't feature a lot of life, but he can blow it by hitters at the letters or use his size to throw it down in the zone with plane. His low-80s slider has some bite at times but gets slurvy too often, and his changeup doesn't feature much action or deception.Scouts don't like the wrist wrap in the back of PERSON's delivery, which affects his feel for his secondary pitches and his command, if not his ability to throw strikes. He'll need to improve his slider and changeup because he can't handle more advanced hitters with just his fastball. Expected to move quickly in 2019, he instead missed the first 10 weeks of the season with a lat strain.",0
"While PERSON was a third-round pick, he was the second college catcher selected in the 2013 Draft, behind only PERSON was drafted largely because of his defensive profile, and he has a good one. PERSON has proven himself --- first at ORGANIZATION II LSU-Eunice, then at ORGANIZATION -- to be an outstanding catch-and-throw guy. He controls the running game with his strong and accurate arm, and he moves well behind the plate while also displaying excellent hands. Since joining the GPE, he's already shown the natural leadership -- working well with pitchers -- teams covet from a backstop. PERSON's offense is still a work in progress, though there is perhaps some strength and power to come.It will be PERSON's glovework that gets him to the big leagues. At the very least, he can get there quickly as a defensive-minded backup.",0
"At the start of the 2017 college season, PERSON was seen as a potential top of the GPE kind of prospect, especially after a strong sophomore season and summer pitching for the GPE National PERSON over the summer. Minor arthroscopic knee surgery kept him from fall ball and that clearly contributed to a sluggish start to his 2017 season, though his stuff came back a bit as the spring progressed. The PERSON were thrilled when he fell to GPE. 18 overall, then watched him help pitch GPE to a ORGANIZATION World Series title before signing him for $3.5 million.When he's going full strength, as he was at the end of the spring, PERSON's fastball will sit around 93 mph and will touch 95 mph consistently with good sink. His slider is a true out pitch, though he threw it a little too much in college. He showed a solid changeup more over the summer, with a good feel for a future Major League average offering. He's more control over command, but he stays around the strike zone.The PERSON went over pick value to sign PERSON, but only slightly. If the uneven start to his junior season was only a blip, they may have gotten a top 10 talent at a bargain rate.",0
"One could argue the 27-year-old ORGANIZATION doesn't belong on a prospects list, but he's not even the oldest player on The ORGANIZATION, and you'd probably like to know more about him, so here we go. ORGANIZATION teams had interest in PERSON when he was a teenager and several of them courted him before he was drafted into ORGANIZATION. Though minor ailments limited his early-career workload, he's been one of the better starters in GPE for the last six years and has been especially good for the last two, before PERSON posted him. He started getting into pitch design after his parent club installed a ORGANIZATION unit in 2016. 
Like a lot of GPE pitchers, PERSON has a kitchen sink repertoire that features a splitter and various breaking balls. Everything is above-average, except for PERSON's fastball. PERSON, PERSON is similar to ORGANIZATION, although his stride direction is more direct to the plate and his delivery has a brief intermission as his landing leg descends (pause) then everything comes home. His arm action is efficient and PERSON's slot is vertical, something it seems that more analytically inclined teams prefer. He sounds like a mid-rotation starter who, for our purposes, will enter his decline phase earlier than everyone else on this list because of his age.",0
"As a draft-eligible redshirt sophomore, PERSON hit .324/.376/.528 with 11 homers at ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION drafted him in the 38th round. He didn't sign, returned to school, hit .287/.496/.810, with 23 homers, stole 18 bases, and was drafted 35th overall. PERSON was totally sure what to make of such remarkable improvement, and PERSON lives in the dreaded right/right 1B/DH bucket for most evaluators, but he had among the best raw power in his draft class and emphatically torched the best conference in college baseball. 
Since entering pro ball, PERSON has performed and moved quickly, slugging 22 homers at Double-A in his first full pro season. His breaking ball recognition is questionable, and may be exposed more this year at ORGANIZATION. The swing and miss issues combined with the defensive limitations are a bit of a problem, but PERSON has more power and is more athletic than most other hitters of this statistical ilk (like the ORGANIZATION and C.J. Crons of the world), so we like his chances of being a major league contributor fairly soon. We just doubt that he's an average or better everyday first baseman, and instead think he's a corner platoon bat.",0
"PERSON' fastball velocity has climbed each of the last three years and is now in the upper-90s. He struck out 171 hitters in 114 innings at ORGANIZATION in 2018 before the ORGANIZATION brought him to the big leagues for six appearances (some out of the bullpen, some as a starter), and he struck out more than a batter per inning there, as well. He was slated to compete for a spot in GPE's rotation during the spring but was sidelined with a quad strain, and may begin the regular season rehabbing or in a lesser role due to the late start.
PERSON' secondaries can sometimes be easy to identify out of his hand, but purely based on movement, they're both plus. His command may limit him to a relief role, or at least a starting role that carries fewer innings than is typical, but he has high-leverage big league stuff, and was perhaps 2018's biggest prospect surprise.",0
"A two-sport star in high school, PERSON's raw tools and athleticism led PERSON to select him in the second round in 2012. Able to focus solely on baseball for the first time, the former prep running back took off in '13, his first full professional season.PERSON is an elite athlete, and he takes advantage of his above-average speed in all phases of the game. His speed is more of a weapon than his power, but he generates enough bat speed to drive balls into the gaps. As PERSON gets more experience, his speed is good enough to make him a good defensive center fielder.PERSON still has a ways to go, but the early returns have been encouraging for PERSON.",0
"PERSON established himself as the best college power hitter available in the 2015 Draft, leading the ORGANIZATION with eight homers the prior summer and then hitting 11 in 40 games as a junior despite breaking the hamate bone in his right hand. After signing for $1.4 million as the 31st overall pick, he paced the short-season LOCATION in homers (12) and slugging (.551) during his pro debut. He struggled when he reached Double-A in mid-2016, but he made adjustments and hit well there and in Triple-A this year.PERSON's big 6-foot-4 frame gives him a lot of strength and leverage, and he uses it to crush balls to all fields. His left-handed swing naturally gets long because of his size, so he probably won't hit for a high average, but he doesn't swing and miss excessively for a masher. He ran into trouble when he first got to Double-A when he expanded his strike zone, then showed more discipline in his return in 2017.While he has a strong arm, PERSON's lack of speed limits his defensive value. After spending most of his time at ORGANIZATION in right field, he spent his first two pro seasons in first base and worked hard to become an adequate defender. With PERSON ensconced in GPE, the ORGANIZATION have played PERSON mostly in left field this year, but he doesn't have much range.",0
"Ever since signing out of GPE in 2014 at age 16 in 2014, PERSON has shown a feel for pitching that belies his age and experience. While that hasn't translated to consistent statistical success as of yet, the organization thought highly enough to send him to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON's playoff run in 2016, giving up two runs in 10 innings over two starts. He made his full-season debut in 2017 at the age of 19.Based on a radar gun, PERSON's fastball is fringy, in the 89-91 mph range, but it plays up because of its life and his ability to command it well. There might be more in the tank velocity-wise as he physically matures and he's already shown a penchant for groundball outs. His best secondary pitch is his changeup, which could be a plus pitch when all is said and done. He throws a big, looping curve ball which will need refinement as he moves up the ladder, but he did start missing more bats in 2016.While PERSON throws a ton of strikes, improvement of his command within the zone will help him continue to miss bats and generate weak contact, as he's been a bit too hittable in the early stages of his career. With time and physical maturity, he could develop into a solid back half of the rotation starter.",1
"PERSON turned down the ORGANIZATION as a 45th-round pick out of high school in 2010, then created buzz by pitching in the mid 90s during the fall at ORGANIZATION (GPE) JC. Signed for $350,000 as an 11th-rounder in 2011, he led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with a 2.25 ERA two years later but missed all of 2014 following PERSON surgery. After the ORGANIZATION eased him back in during '15, he ranked second in the Double-A PERSON in strikeouts (133) and third in strikeout rate (8.5 per nine innings) last year.PERSON's best pitch is his fastball, which sits in the mid 90s with heavy sink. His mid-80s slider gives him a solid second offering when he stays on top of it. His changeup lags behind the rest of his arsenal because it gets too firm and he had trouble locating it for strikes.The key for PERSON is maintaining a direct line to the plate, because when he doesn't, his pitches lose their sharpness and wander up in the strike zone. He has decent control but his command isn't as fine, so some scouts think he'll be better suited for the bullpen. His fastball sat at 97-99 mph and repeatedly reached triple digits when he was a reliever in the ORGANIZATION in 2015.",0
"PERSON' older brother, PERSON, was a 2014 fourth-round pick of the ORGANIZATION out of high school. PERSON opted to head to PERSON rather than sign in 2015 as a 22nd-round pick of the ORGANIZATION. He's been a three-year member of the ORGANIZATION' rotation and stepped into the Friday night role when PERSON went down with an injury, though he missed some time with biceps tendinitis.Assuming health, and PERSON was back on the mound in May, the right-hander has a solid three-pitch mix coming from a high three-quarter delivery and easy arm action. He'll throw his fastball in the 92-95 mph range with good sink. His 80-83 mph slider is inconsistent, but it has sharp break and he can land it for strikes when it's on. His changeup should be a third average offering, a solid offspeed pitch with good sink to it as well.PERSON doesn't miss a ton of bats, but goes right after hitters. He did pitch well on the Cape in brief performances for two summers, which certainly won't hurt his chances of getting drafted in the top five rounds.",0
"The best college power hitter available in the 2015 Draft, PERSON topped the ORGANIZATION with eight homers the previous summer and hit 11 in 40 games as a ORGANIZATION junior despite breaking the hamate bone in his right hand. He has produced as advertised since signing for $1.4 million as the 31st overall pick, leading the short-season LOCATION with 12 homers in his pro debut and slamming a total of 45 homers in his first two full seasons while advancing to Triple-A. His 24 blasts last year were six more than anyone else hit in the organization in the Majors or Minors.PERSON's massive 6-foot-4 frame affords him plenty of strength and leverage, allowing him to hit the ball out of the park from foul pole to foul pole. Though he recognizes that his raw power means he doesn't have to swing for the fences, his left-handed swing can get long and he gets in trouble when he expands his strike zone. His whiff rate jumped to a career-worst 29 percent in Triple-A last year and he'll have to develop more patience to hit for average against advanced pitching.Primarily a right fielder in college, PERSON spent most of his first two pro seasons at first base and worked diligently to become an average defender there. He's blocked by PERSON in GPE, however, so he shifted to left field last May. His lack of speed limits his range, though he does have solid arm strength.",0
"Another exciting arm talent who cannot stay healthy, PERSON has thrown just 20 innings in parts of three pro seasons. His injury issues date back to his college days at ORGANIZATION when he had shoulder trouble that the coaching staff initially said was hamstring tightness. An excellent on-mound athlete with advanced command, PERSON was 91-93 the summer after he signed, then 92-95 with a reshaped array of secondary offerings the following spring. He looked likely to be a quick-mover, someone who might reach Double-A in his first full season. PERSON, his ORGANIZATION did not cooperate and PERSON had PERSON a week after PERSON did. PERSON returned during 2018 extended spring training and his velocity had totally returned. He was 92-93 early in rehab outings, then 91-95 in his first official ORGANIZATION game back from surgery, but it would be his last in-game outing of the summer as he was shelved for the remainder of the regular season by a setback. 
ORGANIZATION has surgical command of a low-90s heater and plus power changeup. So firm is PERSON' cambio that ORGANIZATION units often mistakenly classify it as a sinker as it resides in the mid-to-upper 80s. It bottoms out late and hard, and is PERSON' best secondary pitch. His breaking stuff has evolved since college and at last look, he was throwing a fringy curveball that is effective because of his ability to locate it, and an average upper-80s cutter. He's a potential fourth starter with a value-altering injury history.",0
" The ORGANIZATION went over slot to sign PERSON away from a football scholarship at ORGANIZATION and they likely knew it would take some time to put his considerable raw tools to consistent use on the baseball field. He showed glimpses of his power-speed potential at times and had just been moved up to Double-A in July when the ORGANIZATION sent him to the FACILITY for PERSON. He was traded again in December, when the FACILITY sent him to the D-backs as a part of the three-way deal that brought PERSON to GPE. PERSON' plate discipline has been an issue, in terms of him controlling the strike zone and becoming more efficient, but he has extra-base pop and the ability to steal bases. He turned 23 only a few days before being traded to the D-backs, so there's still time for him to turn his raw tools into production as a power-hitting corner outfielder.",0
"Though he was one of the more polished high school pitchers in the 2015 Draft, PERSON lasted until the ORGANIZATION' fourth selection at ORGANIZATION. 44 because he wasn't very physical and didn't dazzle radar guns. Signed for $1,495,000, he has continued to display advanced feel and shown the makings of a solid three-pitch repertoire. He had no trouble coping with difficult pitching environments in his first two Minor League stops, and he has had little trouble surviving the worst of all (Class A Advanced Lancaster) in 2017.PERSON has picked up more velocity as he has added upper-body strength, now working at 91-93 mph and hitting 96 with precocious command, good downhill plane and some sink. His low-80s curveball might give him his best chance at a plus offering, though it sometimes lacks consistency. He has made nice progress with his tumbling changeup and likes to use it.With his ability to repeat his clean delivery and his high three-quarters arm slot, PERSON lives at the bottom of the strike zone. He could develop true plus command and emerge as a quality ORGANIZATION. 3 starter. If he strengthens his lower half and adds more velocity, he could be better than that.",1
"A reliever as a junior at ORGANIZATION, ORGANIZATION has been developing as a starter since joining the FACILITY and enjoyed a successful first full sason. The big lefty topped the organization in strikeouts and batting average against while finishing second in ORGANIZATION. He has an above-average fastball that will touch 94-95 mph at times, and his curve has the chance to be average as well. While his changeup has improved as he's thrown it more, it's still below-average. He needs to improve that as well as his overall command as he moves up the ladder .He'll continue doing that as a starter, though there are some who see a future for him coming out of a bullpen.",0
"Had he not been intent on playing for his father PERSON, the head coach at ORGANIZATION, PERSON might have been a first-round pick out of high school in 2013. Neither he nor the ORGANIZATION have enjoyed as much success as hoped, however, and his 2016 season ended after one start with an elbow injury that required PERSON surgery in March.PERSON looked like a potential early-round pick again last summer in the ORGANIZATION. He sat in the low 90s and reached 96 mph with sink and tail on his fastball. He can manipulate his power breaking ball into a curve with downward break or a slider with more velocity, and both grade as plus pitches when he can land them in the strike zone -- which he doesn't do consistently.Besides improving his control and command, PERSON also needs to refine and trust his changeup. Despite his ups and downs and his elbow reconstruction, there's a sense that he could be fare better in pro ball than he did in college pitching for his dad. A good impression in the Cape can outweigh a disappointing spring, and he still could go in the first five rounds.",0
"   PERSON's older brother, PERSON, is a pitcher in the ORGANIZATION organization and made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in 2014. PERSON had his best season in the professional ranks in 2014 and performed well in 2015, but the ORGANIZATION didn't protect him on their 40-man roster, allowing the ORGANIZATION to get him with the ORGANIZATION. 1 pick of the Rule 5 Draft.PERSON was projectable and athletic when the ORGANIZATION drafted him in 2011 and he's still working to hone his raw tools. He has a loose, line drive swing that should lend itself to hitting for more power once he physically matures. He knows how to use his speed on the bases and has stolen at least 20 bases in each of his first three professional seasons. Defensively, PERSON began as a third baseman, but the ORGANIZATION moved him to the outfield in 2015. He's seen time at all three spots, and his strong arm and speed are assets there.Defensively, PERSON began as a third baseman, but the ORGANIZATION moved him to the outfield in 2015. He's seen time at all three spots, and his strong arm and speed are assets there.",1
"Every Draft class has a fair share of prospects who make a name for themselves the spring of their Draft year. PERSON is a prime example of a ""pop up"" guy from the LOCATION high school ranks.The big lefty, who is committed to ORGANIZATION, had scouts running to PERSON a little later than usual thanks to some sharper stuff. PERSON was clocked up to 95 mph with his fastball, up a few ticks from his past readings . His secondary stuff, while improved, still doesn't match his arm strength and his fastball. But PERSON shows some feel for his changeup, and there is some projection to his breaking ball. His stuff plays up a bit because of some deception, though there is a little bit of effort in his delivery.PERSON might be a bit of a project, but this kind of arm strength from the left side is bound to intrigue many teams, especially considering how the big southpaw continued to impress most of the spring.",0
"GPE is yet another intriguing high school hitter from Georgia.An athletic outfielder who may not quite be in the ORGANIZATION Meadows/Clint Frazier stratosphere, he can do a lot of things on the baseball field. His best tool is his speed, a true plus for the right-handed hitter. He's a basestealing threat and covers a lot of ground in center field as a result. He makes consistent contact, especially up the middle and away without too much power.That won't be a part of his game anyway, as he profiles more as a leadoff type who can impact the game with his speed.",0
"  The LOCATION high school standout had a very successful first full season, spending the year in the LOCATION League and finishing fourth in strikeouts despite being on an innings count. Tall and lanky, the ball comes out of PERSONâ hand free and easy, allowing his lively fastball to play up. Despite his walk rate, he actually can locate his fastball in and out of the strike zone fairly well. PERSON has two breaking balls, with both the curve and the slider looking like average offerings at least. He has a very good changeup which he uses as an out pitch effectively. His ceiling might be that of a No. 3 starter, but thatâs nothing to sneeze at, and the gloves could come off a bit in 2013.",1
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 4, 2017 - PERSON, Calif.Favorite MLB Player: PERSON committed to GPE Diego State after garnering attention for his hard-throwing ability at ORGANIZATION. He has played in two ORGANIZATION Championship tournaments, won the 2015 GPE World Series and earned a spot on the 2016 Underclass 3rd Team for his efforts.Some scouts have noted that the right-hander has impressive stuff. PERSON can get his fastball up to 94 mph with armside run. He pairs the pitch with a powerful 78 mph curveball that has displayed a tight, 3/4 break at times. On the mound PERSON has a large frame and comes to the plate out of a 3/4 slot. He has medium extension after separation in his delivery and his strength is noticeable.",0
"An GPE transfer from the junior college ranks, PERSON pitched to underwhelming results for two seasons out of the ORGANIZATION' bullpen ahead of his selection by the ORGANIZATION in the 36th round of the 2017 Draft. But after a stellar pro debut in which PERSON posted a 1.47 ERA with 10.0 strikeouts-per-nine across three levels including Class A Hagerstown, it's clear that the ORGANIZATION drafted a better player than even they had expected. A candidate to shoot through the ORGANIZATION in his first full season, PERSON instead had his highly anticipated campaign wiped out when he required PERSON surgery in May. An imposing presence on the mound at 6-foot-7, PERSON has the ability to dominate hitters with his blend of size, stuff and deception. He uses his height to create good angle on a plus fastball that sits in the mid-90s with late life. His slider is his go-to secondary offering, flashing above average, and he also demonstrates feel for throwing a splitter. PERSON had no problems throwing strikes in his pro debut after pitching with below-average control as an amateur. PERSON' strike-throwing ability will be tested at higher levels, as will the consistency and quality of his stuff. But if his pro debut is a sign of what's to come, PERSON, once healthy, could make a quick rise through the ORGANIZATION en route to a late-inning role in GPE's bullpen.",0
"One of the strengths of the 2015 Draft is high school outfielders, and that's apparent in GPE. PERSON likely will be a first-round choice, PERSON should go in the top two rounds and PERSON won't last much longer if teams believe he's signable. He originally committed to GPE (as did GPE), then opted for Virginia.PERSON shows some ability to hit for average and power. He has a quick left-handed swing and manages the strike zone well for a teenager. His 6-foot-3 frame gives him the leverage and projectable strength to become a home run threat once he matures physically.PERSON's best pure tool is his plus speed, which he uses well in center field. He has an average arm and should be capable of playing all three outfield positions.",0
" The Aâs continue to aggressively pursue talent in GPE and they think PERSON has the chance to be a pretty exciting table-setter one day. He made his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2012, mostly playing right field alongside B.J. PERSON. And while he didnât hit like he did during his debut in the ORGANIZATION, the Aâs feel he has the chance to be a solid hitter, one who has shown an understanding of what his game should be, getting on base and running. He wonât have the power profile to be a prototypical right fielder, but he may man a corner with PERSON in center as they move up the system together.",0
"The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their third-round pick in 2013, targeting the GPE ORGANIZATION native for his immense raw power. That power was on full display in 2015 and 2016, as PERSON finished second in the ORGANIZATION with 32 home runs the first year and won LOCATION MVP honors with 24 homers and 102 the following season. After a slow start in Triple-A in 2017, PERSON was rediscovering his power swing when he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION in July.A physical specimen, PERSON's strength and explosive bat speed generate plus-plus raw power from line to line. He can get too pull-happy at times still, though there was progress in his overall approach in 2016. A former high school catcher, PERSON's above-average arm strength is a clean fit in right field, where his athleticism makes him an aggressive but average defender.PERSON checked all of the necessary development boxes in 2016 and did so against advanced competition. Bouncing back from his sluggish first half of 2017, he still has the chance to be a run producer in a big league lineup.",1
"With an exciting combination of stuff, command and feel for pitching, GPE looked like he was headed on a fast track when he skipped a level, going from the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League up to the Class A Advanced PERSON in 2015. But he barely topped 40 innings that season because of elbow issues that eventually led to PERSON surgery and forced him out for all of the '16 season.The ORGANIZATION were thrilled to see GPE back on the mound and healthy in the ORGANIZATION. While there's obvious rust to shake off, GPE's fastball topped out at 95 mph and sat in the 93-94 mph range while showing the same cutting life it had before the injury. He only threw a few breaking balls, but it flashed solid average with good rotation. His changeup, a potential third above-average pitch, was lacking as he didn't have feel for it yet, not uncommon for someone returning from ORGANIZATION surgery. PERSON and command often take longer, though GPE did keep the ball down as he had in the past, eliciting groundball outs.With his velocity and movement back, the ORGANIZATION added GPE to the 40-man roster last offseason. Though his 2017 debut was delayed by a lat strain, he pitched his way up to Double-A in 2017, where he landed on the ORGANIZATION again in July. The ORGANIZATION will understandably take it slow with the right-hander, but the 22-year-old should resume his climb to big league starter status.",0
"The amateur side of the scouting industry is fearful of prep bats from the LOCATION because they face bad pitching during the spring, and are tough to evaluate as hitters. This, PERSON's slightly advanced age relative to other high schoolers, as well as a deep, late first and early second round group of high school outfielders pushed him into the second round despite having first round physical ability. PERSON is a high-effort player with good instincts on the bases and in the field. He probably doesn't have the pure speed for center but has a small hope of staying there based on his feel. Even when he likely moves to a corner, there's enough power for PERSON to profile as an everyday player provided he hits enough, and early returns on his bat in pro ball (he missed ORGANIZATION time due to a wrist fracture but played during instructs) are very strong.",0
"Heading into the 2016 GPE class, there were catchers who had better offensive profiles, and there were backstops who were better defensively, but no one seemed to have a better chance of being a solid all-around big league catcher than GPE. The ORGANIZATION product went in the second round as a result, then saw his prospect stock plummet with a dreadful first full season in 2017 and he was not able to bounce back offensively in 2018 as an injury to his other wrist delayed his start and clearly impacted his production.A natural leader who prides himself on being tough behind the plate, it turned out GPE had hid a right hand and wrist injury from the organization, self-treating it at night and playing through it. It clearly impacted his hitting as he batted only .185 and slugged .265, but he hasn't been able to get back to being the average hitter that he was pre-injury, one with some power to tap into. While he hasn't handled the bat, GPE has impressed the organization with his defensive play. He's great working with pitchers, calling a good game to go along with solid blocking and receiving skills. His throwing has improved, and he'd thrown out just over 33 percent of potential base stealers in his career heading into 2018.GPE deserves some slack because of the injuries, but he does have to show he can stay healthy and be productive at the plate. If he can do that, he could shoot back up this list and reclaim his mantel as one of the best overall catching prospect from his GPE class.",0
"Off the mound, PERSON is polite and professional. On it, the former ORGANIZATION closer is quite the opposite.The bulldog right-hander is all power on the mound, with a nasty fastball-curveball combination. PERSON likes to throw his four-seamer up in the zone, and he combies it with a 12-to-6 curve that has a short late break. He began working on a changeup to give himself a third pitch against left-handed hitters, but he'll likely make a living off the first two offerings.PERSON has struggled with his command at times, but when he repeats his delivery and throws strikes, his above-average stuff is tough to hit. He has all the makings of a late-inning bullpen guy in the near future.",0
"PERSON was originally signed by the ORGANIZATION in December 2010, but after two uneventful summers in the ORGANIZATION, he was first loaned then sold to GPE in the ORGANIZATION, where he played from 2013-17 before signing with PERSON in March 2018. He made quick work of Double-A, earning a bump to Triple-A in May, and he collectively hit .300/.356/.516 with 41 extra-base hits between the two levels. PERSON showed an ability to hit for average throughout his ORGANIZATION stay, hitting .300 or better in four of his five seasons. He has a good approach at the plate, with advanced bat-to-ball skills that limit his strikeouts, as well as surprising extra-base power for his 5-foot-10 frame. Defensively, he's best suited for second base on a daily basis, but he has shown he can handle short or third when needed.The older brother of PERSON, who made his Major ORGANIZATION debut with the ORGANIZATION late last season, PERSON could soon join his younger sibling at the highest level, where he fits the profile of an overachieving utility-type.",0
"A 2011 Draft pick out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE, ORGANIZATION has a reputation of being a solid catch-and-throw receiver and a natural leader behind the plate.Hicks struggled in Double-A in 2013, but the good news is he went back this past year, performed well and earned a promotion to Triple-A. His best tool is his arm, throwing out a combined 38% of would-be basestealers in 2014 (He's at 47% for his career). He greatly improved other aspects of his defensive game, cutting his passed balls total from a whopping 17 in 2013 to just two this past season. He also bounced back with the bat, hitting for average albeit without much power. How much he hits will determine his ultimate role, but he appears just about ready to help out as a big league backup soon.",0
"GPE runner and thrower can play both middle infield spots, hit-over-power type that has limited projection left.",0
"Acquired as part of the return from PERSON for PERSON, PERSON has a near-ready relief profile that might yield multi-inning value because of the depth of his repertoire. He brings 95-98 mph heat from the left side and complements it with a bevy of inconsistent secondary offerings. Opinions vary scout to scout as to which of PERSON's other pitches is best. The changeup has the best movement but PERSON struggles to set it up because he can't locate his fastball consistently. His slider is short and cuttery, the curveball has depth but lacks bite. Taken together, they could be enough to flummox hitters one time through the order, but probably not several times.",1
"PERSON's stuff never took a step during his senior spring, but he's still sitting in the low-90s with average breaking stuff and one of the smoother teenage deliveries in baseball. He's a tremendous ball of soft clay for player dev to mold, an old-school high school pitching prospect.",0
"GPE reminds some scouts of GPE catcher PERSON Contreras.He's lean, muscular and boasts a strong athletic body. He's not a burner on the bases, but he still runs the timed 60-yard run in 6.7-6.8 seconds, which is notable speed for a catcher.There's some pop to his bat and he has a reputation for hitting line drives to all fields. He has shown good bat speed along with some home run power. Both are expected to increase as he grows and develops more strength. For now, his offensive game is ahead of his defense.He'll eventually have to harness some of his aggressiveness and athleticism, but what makes him so fun to watch is how well he moves behind the plate. That said, he flashes above-average arm strength, good range and overall adequate defensive actions. Like most catchers his age, he's still working on his receiving skills and calling games. He's going to stay behind the plate despite displaying the type of athleticism and overall abilities that could lead to a position change.He trains with PERSON and PERSON in GPE. The GPE are the front-runners to sign the teenage catcher.",0
"A product of the ORGANIZATION' efforts in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON's full-season debut in 2015 was a bit uneven. His arm strength and his makeup, though, have PERSON bullish on his future. The young right-hander, who will be 21 for all of the 2016 season, can touch 96 mph with his fastball and will sit in the 92-93 mph range with a very loose arm action. PERSON's changeup is his second-best offering, and he throws the offspeed pitch with good arm speed and deception. His curve gets slurvy, mostly because he tends to change his arm slot when throwing it. He and the ORGANIZATION have worked hard on his delivery to get him to repeat his slot, angle and direction, which will not only help his breaking ball, but his command as well. PERSON gets high marks for his worth ethic, earning the first Fortuna Award in the organization for his commitment on and off the field in 2014 following his GPE debut. It's that work ethic that has the ORGANIZATION confident he can reach his ceiling.",0
" PERSON fits under the description ""Have bat, will travel"" perfectly. In this case, it's not to other organizations, but rather to a number of defensive positions. A third baseman in college, he played there, second base and a little outfield during his 2011 summer debut in the ORGANIZATION system. In 2012, he played second exclusively and he may yet end up in right field. The simple fact is if PERSON keeps hitting like he did in 2012, they're going to find a place for him in the lineup. He won the organizational batting crown and topped it in slugging percentage while showing he wasn't just a product of his ORGANIZATION location by continuing to mash when he moved up to Double-A. He has the chance to be an above-average hitter with at least average power, regardless of what position he's asked to play.",0
"By now, it's clear what PERSON can and will do on the baseball field: He'll hit for power, he'll steal some bases, he'll strike out a lot. PERSON has 20-20 potential thanks to his above-average power and speed. He also has the ability to play strong outfield defense at any of the three spots, though he's largely been a center fielder throughout his career. And yes, he will strike out a good amount. In years past, he's shown an ability to draw walks to help offset that, but he's never going to be a guy who hits for a high average. Whether his swing and miss tendencies will keep him from being a productive everyday outfielder in the big leagues remain to be seen, but it's time for him to get an extended look.",1
"The Phillies haven't shied away from paying physically mature prospects big bucks on the ORGANIZATION market. PERSON is a thick-torsoed righty with premium arm strength and a workable delivery. His breaking stuff is inconsistent and needs to be tightened. This is an arm strength/arm action/athlete buy without present feel for spin or physical projection, but PERSON has had recent success with arms like this.",0
"GPE has big time pull-side lift in his swing, has 45 raw power already at age 17, and a fairly projectable 6-foot-2 frame that portends more. He'll reach down and barrel balls near his shoe tops and also crush mistakes. He's too aggressive right now and probably has to move to a corner eventually, so our early assessment of the profile is that it's very risky. But as far as teenage power projection bats go, this is a good one.",0
"ORGANIZATION' older brother PERSON is among the best catchers in baseball and was a late bloomer, breaking through at age 23 in Double-A. PERSON had his breakout in 2018 as a 20-year-old, going from a trendy pick to breakout to a consensus Top 100 prospect by mid-season. He has been defensively advanced for years, both in his tools and his mental approach to the game, in part due to help from his brother. PERSON projects as an above average defender with a plus arm. ORGANIZATION has also gotten stronger and is growing into his man strength after establishing a feel to hit, so he has a well-rounded approach now. He toned down his swing in 2018 and is slowly adding elements as he feels comfortable, rather than making a noisier swing work all at once. ORGANIZATION stands out because there are not many 21-year-olds who project for average to above offense along with above average defense, and have the makeup/mental part of the game under control without any major red flags like injuries. The scouts who like ORGANIZATION really like him--rounding up on both the tool grades due to makeup and his overall value due to a high floor at a position that's a wasteland in the majors right now. This top 10 could be in almost any order, and ORGANIZATION may be the guy with the biggest variance as to where various baseball people rank him, which is a positive when his ranking peers are mostly MLB-ready, heavily-pedigreed prospects with much more track record.",0
"At times, PERSON can sit 93-97 mph and touch higher with his heater, mixing in an above average to plus slider, so the consistency is the issue as the upside is there. UPDATE: We've gotten a few reports that PERSON's breakout statistical year has come with much more of the mid-90's, above-average-to-plus stuff version we saw in glimpses last year.",0
"PERSON had been yo-yo'd back and forth between the bullpen and the rotation during each of the previous two seasons, but was left to air it out in relief for all of 2018 and broke out, striking out 72 hitters in 64 innings and reaching Triple-A. He's a classic two-pitch, single-inning reliever. PERSON sits 93-96 at times, 91-94 at others, and has a power mid-80s slider. The slider has bat-missing movement away from righties but just kind of tumbles when PERSON tries to throw it for a strike. He doesn't have a great way of attacking lefties, which is part of why his usage may be limited.",1
"The ORGANIZATION have legitimate catching prospects at every level of their system, none with a higher floor than PERSON. He started at three positions (third base, catcher, shortstop) in three years at ORGANIZATION but became a full-time backstop soon after turning pro as a sixth-rounder in 2014. He won PERSON in each of the last two years and made his big league debut this June, only to see his season end with surgery on his non-throwing shoulder a month later.Defensively, PERSON is ready to play regularly in the Majors right now. His receiving and blocking seemingly improve every year, and he gets the most out of his strong arm with a quick release and accurate throws. ORGANIZATION officials love his leadership skills and his ability to run a pitching staff.PERSON had the worst offensive year of his pro career in 2017, batting .241/.275/.323 in Double-A, and didn't hit much better this year. He continued to make contact and exhibit a good two-strike approach, but PERSON will try to get him to drive more balls and add some loft to his compact right-handed swing. More selectivity also could help because he rarely walks.",0
"The ORGANIZATION used both of their 2014 first-round choices on left-handers, taking PERSON at ORGANIZATION. 17 and PERSON at ORGANIZATION. 28. While PERSON pitched in the World Series later that year and established himself in the ORGANIZATION' rotation after being part of the PERSON trade, PERSON has seemed light years away from the big leagues while going 10-20 with a 5.43 ERA in Class A the past two seasons. His promise as a polished left-hander with the potential for three solid pitches earned him a $1.925 million bonus, but his stuff backed up in 2015 and 2016 before improving this year. PERSON often sits in the high 80s and tops out at 93 mph with his fastball, though his velocity has ticked up a notch in 2017 and the ORGANIZATION hope his athleticism and projectability mean that there's more left in his tank. His curveball looks a lot better this season, going from average at best to a plus offering at times. He also has a solid changeup.When PERSON is going well, he shows the aptitude to locate his fastball on either side of the plate and throw strikes with all three of his pitches. He's intelligent, but he's also something of a perfectionist who has had to learn to deal with adversity. While his changeup, build and pitchability used to garner him comparisons to PERSON, he now projects more as a ORGANIZATION. 4 starter.",0
"PERSON starred at ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, Ga.), going 13-0 as a junior in 2015 and winning the clincher in the GPE state 6-A championship series that also wrapped up the ORGANIZATION. 1 national ranking. His talent dictated that he would have gone in the top five rounds of the 2016 Draft, but he fell to the ORGANIZATION in the 35th because he was set on attending PERSON and becoming part of college baseball's top recruiting class. After two years as a reliever, he has fared well as the ORGANIZATION' ORGANIZATION. 1 starter.PERSON excels at pitching to contact with a 91-93 mph fastball that tops out at 95, creating groundballs and awkward swings with sink and the extension in his low-three-quarters delivery. His low-80s slider can be a solid offering when he stays on top of it, though it also can get sweepy and slurvy at times. His fading changeup similarly varies between effectiveness and inconsistency.Strong and durable, PERSON does a nice job of repeating his simple mechanics. He doesn't overpower hitters but he puts his pitches where he wants and limits damage done by walks or home runs. He's one of the safer bets in this year's college class to become at least a back-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"There's no question PERSON stands out on the baseball field because of his size. The ORGANIZATION are hopeful he can do so with his bat as well. While some felt the ORGANIZATION State product would go a bit earlier on GPE night, the ORGANIZATION were happy to get PERSON's offensive potential at the bottom of the first round. PERSON's raw power from the right side of the plate is legitimate and if he can hit consistently enough to tap into it, it could be a plus tool in the future. That ""if"" might've been why he didn't go earlier, though PERSON isn't an all-or-nothing, one dimensional player. He actually has some plate discipline, runs well for his size and has a strong arm, giving him all the raw tools to develop into a prototypical corner outfielder in the future.",1
"  A native of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON made an impressive full-season debut in 2013 at ORGANIZATION A Hagerstown. He continued that success the next season with PERSON and in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's arm strength and athleticism behind the plate leave no doubt he has the skills necessary to catch in the big leagues. He blocks balls in the dirt well, already shows an aptitude for pitch framing and is improving as a game-caller.PERSON made progress offensively in 2014, but his bat remains well behind his glove. He has some pop and his easy swing gives him a chance to eventually hit for more average. As he moves up to the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION, his advanced defensive ability will allow the Nationals to be patient and allow his offense further develop.",1
"PERSON enjoyed a breakout campaign as a ORGANIZATION sophomore, continued to star during the summer for the GPE collegiate national team and put a bow on his ORGANIZATION stock by hitting 15 homers with 44 steals as a junior. The ORGANIZATION made him the fifth-overall pick that June, and PERSON signed for $4,125,000, the largest bonus in club history. PERSON surgery after PERSON's pro debut delayed the start of his first full season, and he never got on track after returning and continued to struggle in the offseason PERSON. The ORGANIZATION still decided to push PERSON up to Double-A in 2018, and he responded to their challenging by becoming the first Minor Leaguer to amass at least 20 homers and 20 steals. PERSON had a quick left-handed bat and a knack for making hard contact as an amateur, leading scouts to project him to hit for both power and average. As a pro, however, PERSON has struggled to control the strike zone, often chasing pitches well out of the zone with a lengthy swing that's led to high strikeout totals -- he led the ORGANIZATION with 156 strikeouts in '17 -- early in his career, albeit with good walk rates. That propensity for whiffing will always be part of PERSON's game, though it's less concerning now that PERSON is trusting his hands, driving the ball the other way and consistently hitting for power.PERSON's plus speed makes him a threat to steal, but his jumps on the basepaths require refinement. His wheels also serve him well in center field, where he's seen the bulk of his playing time as a pro and shows at least average arm strength. PERSON's pro career hasn't unfolded as the ORGANIZATION had hoped, but the club remains optimistic that the toolsy outfielder, with a few key adjustments, can achieve his potential.",0
"In just a couple of years, PERSON has gone from an interesting Day 2 Draft pick from an ORGANIZATION program to a pitcher on the cusp of the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION decided not to add PERSON to their 40-man roster following the 2015 season, opening the door for the Cardinals to nab the right-hander in the ORGANIZATION phase of the Rule 5 Draft.Coming out of a fine GPE program headed by former big leaguer PERSON, PERSON does meet the expectation of an ORGANIZATION hurler, bringing a high degree of intelligence to the mound. With a Tim Lincecum-esque delivery and similar body type, PERSON also has a solid four-pitch mix he uses well to get outs. His bread and butter is his heavy power sinker, which reaches 94 mph and generates a ton of groundball outs. His above-average changeup is his second-best pitch, but he can also throw his hard slider and curveball for strikes.PERSON streaked up the organizational ladder a bit under the radar, then was much more hittable than he had been previously. His ability to make adjustments should still give him the chance to pitch at the back of a big league rotation.",0
"GPE may be the best of a deep crop in the GPE prep ranks, showing above average hitting ability, raw power and arm strength with a long track record of hitting.",0
"A late bloomer who went undrafted out of high school, PERSON parlayed a strong junior season as PERSON's Friday starter into becoming a second-round pick.Tall and lean on a 6-foot-5 frame, PERSON has some room to fill out. And what he has is already pretty good. The left-hander pitches downhill, with natural cutting movement on his fastball. His short, sharp slider is an out pitch at times. PERSON has solid feel for a changeup, though it's still a work in progress. He is generally around the plate with all of his pitches and has been one of the nation's top strikeout pitchers.Taken a round after the ORGANIZATION selected PERSON, PERSON gives GSP another college arm who could move fairly quickly through its system and into the big league rotation.",0
"Signed for $100,000 out of GPE in 2011, PERSON had PERSON surgery before he made his pro debut. He got back on the mound in 2012 and didn't do much to distinguish himself until a strong winter in the ORGANIZATION in 2014. He has progressed rapidly since and made his big league debut last year, when he served four different stints in GPE. He had pitched in four big league games this year before being traded to the Cardinals.PERSON has a quick arm, and his fastball has risen from 90-93 mph when he was a starter to 93-96 mph now that he's a reliever. His heater can get flat at the higher end of his velocity range, so he needs to be careful to keep it down in the zone. He has a second plus pitch in a low-80s curveball and does a nice job of manipulating its spin and shape.PERSON also has a fringy changeup from his days in the rotation and occasionally will use it against left-handers. He has pounded the strike zone throughout his career and isn't afraid to challenge big leaguers. He has a higher floor than ceiling, looking like a good bet to become a seventh-inning reliever.",0
"PERSON, a product of the ORGANIZATION' aggressive acquisition of high school pitching talent in the GPE, got an over-slot deal in the fourth round back in 2010 and was on the cusp of being ready to contribute to the big league staff when he needed PERSON surgery in May.PERSON's rehab went well and he returned to competitive pitching in the second half of the 2016 season. The ORGANIZATION were pleased with how PERSON responded to the challenges of coming back from the elbow surgery and are hopeful he'll get all the way back to the future PERSON starter he appeared poised to become. When healthy, PERSON pounds the strike zone with an above-average fastball and changeup as well as a usable breaking ball. While not overpowering, he uses his 6-foot-6 frame well to throw downhill. He has good command, thanks to a free and easy delivery he repeats consistently.The ORGANIZATION won't rush PERSON back, just like they didn't with fellow TJ recipients PERSON and PERSON, but he does appear right on schedule and should get back to carving out a career as a No. 3 or 4 starter soon enough.",0
"PERSON, a native of the ORGANIZATION, made his GPE debut in 2013 and quickly showed off his exciting potential for GPE scouts. He had a 29-game hitting streak at ORGANIZATION, breaking PERSON's franchise record. PERSON has an easy left-handed swing and, though he is aggressive, has a knack for barreling up balls. He has some pop in his bat already, and scouts believe he will develop more power as he physically matures. He is still learning in the outfield. He has mostly played center field so far but may eventually profile better as a right fielder when he fills out. Though PERSON hasn't played full-season ball yet, his feel for the game belies his age.",1
"PERSON sat out all of 2016 after transferring to PERSON & Mary from GPE, where he had appeared in just 12 games out of the bullpen as a freshman. The redshirt sophomore pitched to mixed results in his first season with The Griffin but showed enough arm strength and stuff to warrant a third-round selection by the ORGANIZATION. A physically strong and durable left-hander, PERSON operates in the low-to-mid 90s with his fastball and can reach back for 96 mph, all while maintaining his velocity deep into games. His changeup is his best secondary offering, one that receives above-average grades from scouts, and he also features a pair of average breaking balls in a curveball and a slider. After missing plenty of bats but struggling to throw strikes as an amateur, PERSON pitched to opposite results during his pro debut. Learning to repeat his delivery as well as harnessing his stuff and throwing more strikes would bode well for his chances of remaining a starter, although there's little doubt among scouts that PERSON could move quickly in a bullpen role.",0
"PERSON led PERSON to the 2012 College World Series championship, hitting .476 with two homers to earn Most Outstanding Player honors. A corner outfielder for the ORGANIZATION, he had the bat but not the power to profile at that position at the next level, so the ORGANIZATION moved him to second base in his first full pro season.PERSON's bat hasn't disappointed in pro ball. He has established himself as the best pure hitter in GPE's system, leading ORGANIZATION farmhands with a .318 average, 38 doubles and 256 total bases in 2014. His ability to recognize pitches and control the strike zone translates into consistent line drives to all fields.He still figures to top out at 15 homers per season, so PERSON's chances of becoming a big league regular hinge on his ability to handle second base. He has made progress there but still struggles with his footwork and probably won't become more than an adequate defender. His average speed and arm strength hinder his ability to play on the left side of the diamond, so his fallback option would be as an outfielder rather than a utilityman.",1
"The ORGANIZATION also acquired PERSON, the ORGANIZATION 2018 4th round pick out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE. PERSON was dominant during the first four starts of his junior year, but his control disappeared once the ORGANIZATION began conference play. He struggled to throw strikes for two months leading up to the draft and fell to the fourth round. PERSON does have good stuff. He'll sit 90-94 and his big, 6-foot-6 frame and lower arm slot combine to create a unique look for hitters. His slider breaks late and has good length when located to PERSON's arm side, and PERSON's changeup has good action because of his lower arm slot. His limited command probably relegates PERSON to the bullpen eventually, but he has #4/5 starter stuff if he can develop better control in his mid-20s, which sometimes happens to pitchers this size. ",0
"As an amateur at ORGANIZATION, GPE was seen as an fringe-to-average bat with above average power, questionable catcher defense, and arm strength that may push him to first base. The ORGANIZATION drafted him in the second compensation round for an overslot bonus, using the pick they bought from GPE in exchange for PERSON's contract. Eventually, and ironically, PERSON traded him to GPE as part of the multi-player return for PERSON and PERSON' O'Day's contract. Since signing, GPE's defense and pop times have improved, due in part to a slimmed-down physique and in part to improved throwing mechanics that make the most of his average arm strength. We think he'll be able to catch part time and also have enough of a bat to contribute at first base, ORGANIZATION, or as a pinch hitter. He's moved down a bit for us since last season as his strong start and improved defense early in 2018 tailed off a bit later in the season, which is somewhat common for players who are dealing with physical change during the longest full-time catching spell of their lives. Some scouts questioned GPE's bat control and thus his hit tool and game power in late 2018 looks, so looks early in 2019 may tell us if this was a slight regression in tools, or just temporary fatigue he can get past. The likely outcome looks like a valuable switch-hitting backup catcher whose bat you want to get in the lineup most days, which we value the same we would a low-end regular.",0
"Because PERSON wasn't a regular on the showcase circuit last summer and didn't stand out at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in the fall, he barely registered on the radar of scouts. That changed this spring, when his tools took a step forward and evaluators flocked to GPE Antonio to see him. ORGANIZATION (GPE) High outfielder PERSON rode a similar path to a third-round selection by the ORGANIZATION in 2017, and PERSON could land in similar territory.PERSON has some arm bar in his left-handed swing, though he overcomes it with advanced feel for hitting. PERSON strong with good snap in his wrists, he has above-average bat speed and raw power. While his offensive potential is impressive, he has little track record against quality competition.If PERSON continues to develop and improve, he could wind up with solid or better tools across the board. The GPE recruit has plus speed and should be able to stick in center field once he improves his reads and routes. His strong arm will allow him to play anywhere in the outfield and produces an upper-80s fastball on the mound.",0
"The ORGANIZATION knew that PERSON -- a high school product who didn't catch much in high school because of his athleticism -- would take time to develop. An injury-interrupted first full season didn't help in that regard, either. The ORGANIZATION made the decision in 2014 to move him to third base, at least for the short term.Pittsburgh's aggressive promotion of PERSON to full-season ball in 2013 proved to be challenging for the GPE prepster, particularly defensively. Shoulder problems hurt his development, but PERSON made strides offensively at instructional league, and the ORGANIZATION believe in his bat and work ethic.PERSON should get a mulligan for 2013, and the move to third will allow him to let his bat develop more, not to mention free up a playing-time logjam with ORGANIZATION.",0
"There is little question the ORGANIZATION have some aptitude in evaluating, drafting and developing college hitters. The big league roster is all you need to see as proof, with PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON serving as perfect examples. ORGANIZATION could be part of the next wave of college bats to impact PERSON's advanced approach at the plate, with excellent plate discipline and a good idea of the strike zone, has helped his transition to pro ball. He has both strength and bat speed from the right side, with the chance to have at least PERSON average in-game power, which was on display as he slugged .516 during his pro debut and reached full-season ball. ORGANIZATION moved around defensively at ORGANIZATION, but played third base exclusively during his pro debut. He has a solid arm, though needs to work on his accuracy, and he's a fringy defender. The ORGANIZATION believe he has a chance to stay there.ORGANIZATION has quickly become the top third baseman in the system and there's not much in front of him blocking his path. Assuming he plays solid enough defense, he could hit PERSON in a hurry.",1
"The ORGANIZATION of GPE has had five pitchers reach the big leagues, the most recent being PERSON, who saw time up with the A's in 2018. PERSON's ascent up the ORGANIZATION' ladder since being a sixth-round pick in 2015 hasn't necessarily wowed anyone, but he's knocking on the door after reaching Triple-A and leading the organization in ORGANIZATION in '18, earning him a spot on the 40-man roster. He seemed certain to be the next Zips hurler to make it to the highest level in 2019, but a forearm strain and elbow inflammation has kept him out of action for most of the season.PERSON's two best pitches are his fastball and slider. He'll pitch in the 92-96 mph range with his heater, thrown with sink. His slider flashes plus and it's firm, around 88 mph. It has some dart-like life to it and sometimes looks more like a cutter, a pitch he gets a lot of weak contact on the ground with. He started mixing in a curveball to give hitters a different look and he also has a changeup, though that's too firm with not enough differential from his fastball. He can throw strikes with all of his offerings.With more of a ground-ball oriented approach to pitching, PERSON has never missed a ton of bats. The one exception to that was when he pitched in relief in the ORGANIZATION in 2017. While he has the arsenal and durability to be a back-end starter, there are some who think he might have more long-term success as a two-pitch reliever.",0
"As a sophomore at ORGANIZATION in 2018, GPE collected the second-most strikeouts in school history. When he followed that up with 11 shoutout innings for ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION, he looked poised to be one of the more intriguing college lefties in the 2019 ORGANIZATION class. But a forearm issue slowed him early as his velocity dipped, hurting his stock considerably, though he was pitching better as the ORGANIZATION approached.At his best, GPE leans heavily on his fastball-curve combination. When he's 100 percent healthy, he'll sit around 90-92 mph with his heater. His breaking ball is a pure curveball that he throws a lot as his out pitch. It will flash plus at times, but he doesn't always land it consistently. He does have a below-average changeup, but rarely is asked to throw it. An unorthodox delivery that includes a head snap adversely impacts his command on a regular basis.Having put the forearm injury behind him helps his stock, but because of the effort in his delivery and his difficulty in finding the strike zone consistently, most see a move to the bullpen in GPE's future. In shorter stints, his two-pitch repertoire could play well and still land him in the top five rounds.",0
"Seen as a safe pick, PERSON garnered some consideration for the first overall pick of the 2013 Draft before landing with the Marlins at ORGANIZATION. 6 overall. He was having a solid, if unspectacular, first full season when PERSON sent him to GPE in the ORGANIZATION deal.PERSON comes from a baseball family (his uncle, B.J. PERSON, and his brother, PERSON, have both played professionally), and he has a good understanding of the game. He is a pure hitter with an advanced approach. PERSON wonder how much power he will have, however, as his swing is more geared to produce line drives than home runs. PERSON is a below-average runner, but it doesn't hold him back defensively. He is sure-handed, and he has a strong arm.While PERSON's power will likely determine his impact, few doubt he will become a solid Major Leaguer.",1
"GPE parlayed his impressive turn in the 2014 Cape Cod League with a strong junior year at ORGANIZATION into a second-round selection in the '15 PERSON. The ORGANIZATION gave the right-hander a $1,108,000 bonus as the ORGANIZATION. 55 overall pick, and GPE quickly rewarded the organization by pitching well at ORGANIZATION A Wisconsin in his pro debut. A right forearm strain suffered early in 2016 led to a two-month disabled-list stint, and GPE was ineffective when he finally took the mound. PERSON healthy in 2017, GPE finally furthered his development, pitching well over 22 starts (3.38 ERA) with PERSON and then finishing his season on a high note in Double-A.Listed at 6-foot-6, 265 pounds, GPE has an imposing presence on the mound. He's sacrificed some of his velocity for better command, though he still sits comfortably in the low 90s and at times higher, with an upper-80s cutter enables him to effectively attack left-handed hitters under the hands. His changeup is below average because he throws it too firmly, albeit it with fastball-like arm speed. His curveball, though still slurvy at times, has improved as a professional and receives average grades from evaluators. He throws all four pitches for strikes, and knows how to utilize his height to drive the ball down in the zone.GPE's strikeout rate backed up in 2017 as he focused on throwing more quality strikes and working deeper into games. While he still needs to refine his secondaries and fastball command, as well as answer some lingering questions about his durability, GPE has all the ingredients needed to become a big league starter.",0
"  Concussions slowed PERSON's progress through the ORGANIZATION after the ORGANIZATION made him the 10th overall pick of the 2011 Draft, but he overcame those ailments to make his Major League debut in September 2014. PERSON has well-above-average speed and uses it to his advantage. He knows how to bunt for a hit and sprays line drives to all fields. He has minimal power but has the tools to be a prototypical top-of-the-order hitter.  PERSON was a third baseman in college and was quickly shifted to second base by the ORGANIZATION. They also gave him regular work in the outfield in 2014, and he may eventually carve out a role as a super-utility player in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"The last infielder from ORGANIZATION's to make a splash in the ORGANIZATION and then the big leagues was PERSON, who was a first-rounder in 2011 and is now the ORGANIZATION' starting second baseman, a former All-Star and ORGANIZATION winner. PERSON doesn't quite fit on that scale, but then again, few thought PERSON would be this good, either.Like PERSON, PERSON plays shortstop for ORGANIZATION's, but will likely need to shift over to second base at the next level. He has a very good internal clock that helps him slow down the game, and he gets rid of the ball quickly, but many feel his arm, average at best, isn't enough to stay on the left side of the infield long-term. His hands and feet should work just fine at second. Not the biggest guy in the world, PERSON has shown a strong hit tool this spring from the left side of the plate, with an advanced approach that has led to more walks than strikeouts in his college career. He has some extra-base power and can run into a few homers along the way.PERSON isn't going to jump into the first round like PERSON did six years ago, but he is performing well for a good college team at just the right time. A team that sees a little PERSON in him could take him in the top five rounds.",0

On the high school scene, the shortstop is a two-year varsity baseball letterwinner at FACILITY, as well as a 2016 All-CIF Division II First Team selection, and he was named a ORGANIZATION All-Area First Team selection in 2016. He helped lead his high school club to a league title in his junior campaign, hitting over .400 with 30 RBIs in 31 games.The small-bodied middle infielder has athletic ability. He makes plays, and once he adds more strength, PERSON's bat and arm give him a chance to better his prospect status.",0
"GPE and toolsy, PERSON has developed considerably in his three years at ORGANIZATION State.While there's still some swing and miss to his game, he's progressed tremendously at the plate. The more consistent of a hitter he can become, the more he can tap into his outstanding raw power. He's a good runner who's even better underway, and he has a cannon for an arm. He's strong and physical and might very well fit the profile for a right fielder at the highest level.The team that believes PERSON will hit enough will be the one to take him in the early stages of the GPE.",1
"PERSON was a legit top-3 round talent as both a hitter and pitcher coming out of high school in 2014 and some were surprised when the ORGANIZATION took him in the 2nd round and announced him as a hitter. He's rewarded their faith, showing the expected plus bat, but not quite delivering on his game power potential, while also losing a step and becoming a right fielder, when he was a serviceable center fielder as an amateur. There's some maturity concerns that have dogged PERSON for years, but he's essentially big league ready with a 60 bat and arm, along with the potential for a fun position player pitcher option.",1
"Though PERSON helped ORGANIZATION win the GPE 7-A state title and finish No. 2 in the final national rankings in 2013, he didn't live up to expectations at the plate and concerned teams with his commitment to PERSON. Thus the ORGANIZATION were able to draft him in the 30th round, where they signed him for $440,000. After a lackluster debut, he was one of the best hitters in the short-season ORGANIZATION York-League as an 18-year-old last summer before he tore a thumb ligament in July.With his hand-eye coordination and all-fields approach, PERSON should hit for average. He shows promising patience and a willingness to use the whole field. Though he hit just one homer in 46 games during his first two pro seasons, he has the bat speed and strength to hit at least 15 longballs per season as he gets stronger. PERSON has below-average speed but moves well enough to play on the outfield corners rather than at first base. He has a solid arm that delivered low-90s fastballs when he was a two-way player in high school.",0
"The son of former big leaguer PERSON, this Colorado high school middle infielder had scouts heading to the ORGANIZATION to check out his tools. There are many things to like about PERSON, who is committed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE should he go that route. He has some bat speed and some strength from the right side of the plate. He has some speed and likes to make things happen on the basepaths. He's agile and should be able to defend up the middle. Most feel, however, that it won't be at shortstop, with a shift to second base a likelihood in the future. There is also some concern about the swing and miss in the offensive part of the game.Even with those concerns, PERSON's raw tools and PERSON lineage are sure to draw more than a fair share of interested teams when the ORGANIZATION rolls around.",0
" The projectable right-hander has had trouble turning his raw potential into performance thus far In his brief career. The ORGANIZATION sent PERSON to full-season ball in 2011 and he struggled, walking more batters than he struck out. He cut his walk rate in 2012, but he was down a level in the short-season LOCATION and didn't have much other success. His ceiling, athleticism and arm strength still make him worth watching. He still has the potential to have a plus fastball, though his secondary pitches and, obviously, his command need a lot of work.",0
"One of the first deals in the class, PERSON hasn't been scouted much as a result. He doesn't have much physical projection but has advanced feel for contact and can probably still behind the plate.",0
"PERSON entered last summer as perhaps the top player in the entire class, and certainly among the high school set. A combination of a relatively pedestrian summer showcase performances and an extremely high expectation bar, a trend that has continued this spring, caused his star to fade, though he's still one of the better prep players in the nation.PERSON does everything fairly well, though a lack of a true plus carrying tool is one reason why scouts were a bit down on him. Most feel he has the chance to be a plus hitter with an advanced approach at the plate using a high-contact, line-drive spray kind of approach. With a lean frame, there is some question about how much strength he'll add, with believers thinking power will come. Most feel he is a long-term shortstop, though some don't see it as a slam dunk. Some feel PERSON suffered more from being seen for so long that he was bound to get knocked simply for not being the best player on the field at all times. Others haven't seen him dominate the way they feel a top-of-the-Draft prospect should in high school. He is committed to ORGANIZATION, which could become an issue depending on when he's selected.",0
"The ORGANIZATION had to draft PERSON twice before they could land him. A two-way player as a left-handed pitcher/outfielder at GSP (GPE) JC, he turned them down as a 38th-rounder in 2010 before agreeing to a $77,000 bonus as an 18th-rounder the following year.PERSON has a pair of solid pitches in a low-90s fastball that peaks at 96 mph and a curveball with power and 12-to-6 break when it's on. He also has a fringy slider and changeup.Because PERSON has a four-pitch repertoire, GPE tried him as a starter in his first two full pro seasons. But there's effort in his delivery and he struggles to repeat it, compromising his ability to find the strike zone, so he became a full-time reliever after returning from an elbow strain in mid-2014.",0
"PERSON began his college career at GPE (GPE) JC, winning the ORGANIZATION III Junior College World Series and the D-III juco pitcher of the year award in 2014 after leading that level in wins (10) and finishing second in strikeouts (87 in 71 2/3 innings). He transferred to PERSON in 2015 and opened this season in its weekend rotation before inconsistency landed him in the bullpen. He has thrived in that role, however, showing enough arm strength to go in the first five rounds.When he locates his pitches, PERSON is hard to handle. He attacks hitters with a 90-94 mph fastball that's difficult to barrel if he keeps it down in the strike zone. His low-80s slider has been sharper in shorter stints and can overmatch left-handers, and he rarely uses his below-average changeup now that he's coming out of the bullpen.PERSON is just 5-foot-9 and generates his hard stuff with some effort in his delivery. He doesn't always repeat his mechanics, which costs him command. Despite some success starting in the ORGANIZATION last summer, he profiles strictly as a pro reliever who might be useful in high-leverage situations, especially against lefties.",0
"Prime's breakout in his full-season debut in 2014, during which he led the organization in home runs and tied for the system lead in GPE, may have come as a surprise to those outside of the organization, but the Rockies weren't shocked to see the big first baseman produce.One of the harder workers in the system, Prime greatly improved his ability to turn on inside pitches, hitting the ball out front in order to create power to his pull side. There's still a good amount of swing and miss to his game, and he needs to improve his plate discipline so he can continue to tap into his above-average raw power consistently. Prime is still growing, showing up to Spring Training a half-inch taller. PERSON 6-foot-5, Prime is more agile than you'd expect. He has quick feet and soft hands that work well at first base, which should allow him to be a solid defender. Prime might just be scratching the surface. As he grows into his already strong body, there might be more power to come, allowing him to profile very well at the infield corner position.",0
"GPE's stuff took off whhen he lowered his arm slot a bit last year. He's had middling success this season but is also at Double-A, missing a bat per inning, in his first full pro season. He's a potential #3 starter.",1
"PERSON went from walk-on to 22nd-round pick in three years at Tennessee-Martin, then blew out his elbow in his first full pro season with the Royals in 2013. He regained his secondary pitches and command quicker than most pitchers who had PERSON surgery, and he jumped from Double-A to the Majors in 2016. PERSON appreciated his strike-throwing ability but designated him for assignment after signing PERSON in February, then dealt him to the ORGANIZATION for outfield prospect PERSON Dewees.PERSON works off his fastball, which plays above its average 91-95 mph velocity because he sinks it, maintains it into the late innings and locates it where he wants. Though his solid changeup is his best secondary pitch, he got away from using it during his brief big league debut. He utilizes a pair of breaking balls but his curveball and slider are average at best.While PERSON doesn't have much margin for error, he doesn't make many mistakes. He pounds the bottom of the zone but can get hittable at times because he's around the strike zone so much. He gives GPE some big league-ready starting pitching depth, though bone chips in his elbow have sidelined him for much of 2017.",0
"PERSON pitched to mixed results as a swingman during his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION and didn't fare much better as a junior in 2014 after a move to the bullpen. His raw stuff continued to improve throughout his college career, though, and the ORGANIZATION took notice, eventually selecting PERSON in the 14th round that June. He struggled as a starter early in his pro career surrounding PERSON surgery in 2015, but moved to the bullpen in 2018 and promptly took off in the new role, turning in a strong first half with PERSON, then posting a 0.92 ERA over 15 appearances after a July promotion to Double-A. After the season, the ORGANIZATION added PERSON to their 40-man roster. A big and physical right-hander, PERSON will show two plus pitches in any given outing. He reaches 97-98 mph with his heater and throws it with late life that makes it difficult to lift for hitters on both sides of the plate. His breaking ball is equally dynamic, thrown in the upper 80s with sharp, downer action that helps him miss bats with ease. Pitching at two levels in 2018, PERSON averaged 12.9 strikeouts-per-nine, with a 16 percent swinging strike rate. PERSON's ability to induce whiffs with both pitches makes his below-average control (4.4 walks-per-nine in '18) a lesser issue, though there is some concern over whether hitters will continue to chase his stuff outside of the zone at higher levels. Given the ORGANIZATION' history of aggressively pushing their best relief prospects, PERSON could soon find himself in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON was regarded as one of the top prospects in GPE when PERSON signed him in 2008. Now, after slow but steady progress through the ORGANIZATION, he is close to realizing that potential and helping the Indians in the Majors.Defense has always been the strongest part of PERSON's game. His arm, glovework, range and ability to make plays while coming in all make him an above-average defender at third base.At the plate, PERSON isn't quite as advanced, but he has made strides recently. His hand-eye coordination makes him difficult to strike out, even though he is something of a free-swinger. PERSON has a good feel for hitting, and he makes good use of his solid raw power.",1
" PERSON had built a reputation as one of the better college closers in the game, collecting 28 saves over his first two seasons at ORGANIZATION and pitching extremely well out of the bullpen in the ORGANIZATION last summer. When moved into the rotation for his junior year, though, his stuff backed up and knocked him down several pegs on GPE boards everywhere. When pitching in shorter stints, he would crank his fastball up into the 94-97 mph range consistently. His very good changeup would play off of that, and he lived largely off of that two-pitch mix. As a starter, PERSON has been very vanilla, largely pitching with an 89-91 mph fastball and trying to use his fringy breaking ball more frequently. He's moved around to various spots in ORGANIZATION's weekend rotation as a result. Any team considering taking PERSON in the top five rounds will be doing so based on his track record and success on the Cape. A return to a bullpen could allow him to move fairly quickly through a system as well.",1
"One of the more well-rounded position players in the 2015 Draft class, PERSON has solid tools across the board. Evaluators who like him think several of those could develop into plusses, though he'll have to get picked early to deter him from his Stanford commitment. PERSON has a fluid, compact left-handed swing and a good feel for hitting. He uses the entire field, has performed well against quality pitching on the showcase circuit and with the GPE 18-and-under national team, and is growing into some power. He's not especially quick out of the batter's box but flashes plus speed at times once he gets going.PERSON has enough speed and arm strength to play all three outfield positions, though he profiles best in right field. Scouts have compared him to PERSON and ORGANIZATION prospect PERSON, a high school first-rounder in 2011.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 4, 2017 - PERSON, Calif.Favorite MLB Player: PERSON is an PERSON commit who was selected as a 2015 ORGANIZATION and a 2016 ORGANIZATION First Teamer. PERSON participated in the ORGANIZATION All-American Games, the 2015 ORGANIZATION Games, the 2015 ORGANIZATION and the 2016 ORGANIZATION. He also made the 2015 17U ORGANIZATION Development Program roster, allowing no runs and just one hit in two innings pitched. PERSON is both lean and physically projectable. The PERSON commit has polished mechanics and he is smart with the baseball on the mound. The hurler features a sneaky two-seam fastball that sits at 89-91 mph and a curveball with sharp, late break, the latter of which can be a future out pitch.Overall, scouts note that PERSON is a fearless competitor who challenges hitters inside and displays a confident demeanor.",0
"PERSON was a late-rising small school arm in the 2019 draft. He has a workhorse build, mid-90's velocity, feel for spin and glove side location, and some other starter traits.",0
" PERSON was a member of the 18-and-under national team that won the World Cup in GPE last September. He played well in the tournament, tying for the team lead with nine ORGANIZATION, and continued his strong play through the spring. PERSON is a solid defender behind the plate.

He creates good bat speed and projects to have at least average power.PERSON's father, PERSON, pitched for two seasons in the ORGANIZATION and spent several years as a coach in the ORGANIZATION organization. J.J., a GPE recruit, has clearly benefited from his father's instruction, and scouts praise his makeup and feel for the game.",0
"GPE has a solid set of tools across the board, but it's his hitting ability that stands out.The 16-year-old has a medium frame with wide shoulders and lean body that will fill out in the future. At the plate, the shortstop shows plus bat speed with good timing, rhythm and a mature approach when he's in the batter's box. He has a gift for barreling up balls and has a strike zone awareness that's beyond his teenage years.He hits line drives to all fields and his power is starting to show. He's expected to add more strength once he signs with a team and his body continues to develop. On defense, he has a chance to stay at shortstop because he shows good actions at the position, soft hands and good footwork. He has slightly above-average arm strength with accuracy and has shown the ability to throw from different angles. He does not have blazing speed, but he's doesn't clog the bases, either. He's been praised for his work ethic along with his good makeup and the team that signs him will likely envision him as an everyday middle infielder in the big leagues on day.GPE trains with PERSON, a member of ORGANIZATION's PERSON, at FACILITY in GPE, GPE.

"It hasn't been the most direct career path for this Rutgers product, but PERSON has an intriguing set of tools he's just learning how to use consistently.A football player in college, PERSON didn't return to baseball until his senior year, where he promptly had a huge season and moved up ORGANIZATION boards in a hurry. PERSON has the tools to be a run-producing third baseman with the ability to hit for average and plenty of power. He runs well for a guy his size, and he brings a football mentality to his game on a daily basis. PERSON had some rough edges due to his time away from the game, but he started to smooth them out in 2013. More reps will help, and the end result could be PERSON becoming an everyday corner infielder.",0
"PERSON stood out as a 15-year-old because of his one, truely freakish ability: he has a stone-cold 80 arm (clocked in the mid-80's with a radar gun) and a quick release that allow him to regularly post pop times below 1.80 in games, which is generally a 70-grade time. PERSON is a mature-bodied prospect and a 30 runner presently, someone who appears 'unathletic' on the surface. We often talk about football and baseball athleticism as being two different things, and PERSON is not football athletic, but definitely is baseball athletic. Instead of timed speed or visible strength, he displays quick-twich movement, first step quickness, and overall explosion through strength in the forearms, wrists, and hands. PERSON is an ideal case study in the differences, as he's got soft hands and is mobile behind the plate, and has solid average raw power with similarly graded bat control. The ORGANIZATION may have a 5 defensive catcher with a 5 bat, 5 raw power, and an 8 arm here. That would be quite a find for $600,000, especially given the current wasteland that is big league catching.",1
"PERSON should develop into a prototypical right fielder with a very strong arm, the ability to drive in runs and some baserunning skills to boot, but that development was put on hold when reconstructive elbow surgery forced him out for the entire 2013 season. The toolsy outfielder wasn't ready for the GPE League in 2011 and had to go back down to the ORGANIZATION. When he moved back up a level in 2012, he took the ORGANIZATION by storm, earning a promotion to Double-A. There is little PERSON can't do on the field. He has tremendous bat speed, which should help him develop more power, and improved plate discipline has been a key to him becoming a better all-around hitter. It's not just at the plate where PERSON needs to tone things down at times. He's very aggressive on the basepaths and in the outfield, sometimes to a fault.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1

He has rebounded in 2017, matching his home run total from his first two seasons (10) midway through the spring.PERSON has a higher ceiling than most college players in this Draft. He has the strength and bat speed to hit for power and the plus speed to steal some bases and possibly stick in center field. He enhances his on-base ability by drawing a healthy amount of walks and hit-by-pitches.Scouts aren't totally sold on PERSON's right-handed swing, so he'll have to prove he can make consistent contact with wood bats. He also needs to improve his reads and routes to remain in center as a pro, and his fringy arm will dictate a move to left field if he can't.",1
GPE has parlayed a strong Cape showing into attention this spring where he flashes #3/4 starter upside with a low-to-mid-90's fastball and a plus changeup. Went lower than talent suggested in the draft due to needing TJ after signing.,0
Strong-bodied infielder with present power.,0
"PERSON hit 93 mph with his fastball as a freshman at GPE (Mo.) JC in 2012, but he went undrafted because he's small and was committed to GPE. After he proved himself as a reliever and a starter against tougher LOCATION competition, he signed for $150,000 as a 12th-rounder in 2014. He reached Double-A midway through 2016 and has established himself as one of the better lefty starting pitching prospects in a GPE system thin in that department.PERSON lacks a plus pitch, relying instead on mixing four offerings and deception to succeed. His fastball sits in the low 90s and peaks at 95 with some run on it. His changeup regressed a bit in 2016 but is solid once again, and his slider improved when he had to use it more often a year ago. He also uses a slow curveball to give batters a different look.His delivery isn't the smoothest and features some effort, though it also makes PERSON' pitches tougher to pick up and doesn't prevent him from throwing strikes. He doesn't miss a lot of bats and his velocity tails off in the later innings, so he might be better suited for middle relief than for the back of a rotation. He lacks the dynamic breaking ball to profile as a lefty specialist.",0
"The ORGANIZATION aren't afraid to take high school pitchers in the first round, having done so with seven of their last 14 selections. Their latest is PERSON, who lasted 22 picks last June because the industry tends to downgrade prep right-handers on GPE day. Outside of PERSON, who went No. 2 to the ORGANIZATION, PERSON had as good an arm as anyone in the 2014 high school class and he signed for $2.5 million.PERSON began his high school senior season by hitting 100 mph during a preseason scrimmage and continued to bring the heat for the rest of his spring and into his pro debut. He usually works at 93-95 mph with impressive life and command. His hard breaking ball can make hitters look bad as well, combining curveball depth with slider velocity in the low 80s.PERSON also exhibits some feel for a changeup, which should become at least an average third pitch. There isn't much projection in his relatively short and stocky frame, but that doesn't matter because his present stuff is plenty good enough to make him a starter. He also does a nice job of throwing strikes for a youngster.",0
"GPE body and swing, could be high-contact ORGANIZATION with speed",1
"Precipitation and misfortune forced Double-A PERSON to play three double-headers in a row in late May (not on consecutive days, but still) and, suddenly, the club was in need of pitching reinforcements. The ORGANIZATION promoted PERSON directly from extended spring training to make a spot start, just three days after his 20th birthday. It's further evidence of PERSON' advanced on-mound craftsmanship, which enables him to succeed with limited stuff. He has now had two strong years of performance at short-season affiliates on the back of a sinking and tailing upper-80s fastball and a slurvy 78-82 mph breaking ball. PERSON' delivery is pretty rough but it doesn't appear to detract from his command, and it may actually help make him tougher for hitters to time. Little things like that are important, as his stuff exists on the margins. If his command maxes out, he'll be a sinker balling backend starter.",0
"PERSON ranked No. 1 on MLB.com's Top 20 international prospects list last summer and he received one of 10 seven-figure bonuses handed out to international amateurs during the signing period, coming to terms on the opening day of the period. He's yet to make any kind of debut, either in the ORGANIZATION or in the GPE, but he's dazzled scouts with his bat speed, hitting mechanics and raw power. He's also opened eyes with his speed and instincts on the bases. His all-around speed combined with his aggressive style, strong arm and athletic body have brought about comparisons to GPE outfielder PERSON when he was the same age.",0
"PERSON rocketed from a sub-6-footer with a mid-70s fastball when he entered PERSON (PERSON) to 6-foot-7 and low-90s heat by the time he was a sophomore. He has continued to improve, impressing on the showcase circuit and with the GPE national 18-and-under team last year and pitching better than ever this spring. He has been spectacular in the GPE 5-A state playoffs, striking out 53 and allowing just two unearned runs in 27 innings to earn four wins and pitch the Mules into the semifinals, and he could be the second high school right-hander drafted, behind PERSON' PERSON has a complete three-pitch arsenal, starting with a 92-97 mph fastball with some cutting action at the lower end of that range and some running life at the upper end. His power curveball tops out in the low 80s with tight spin and good depth, and he'll sometimes turn it into a harder slider. He has upgraded his changeup and used it more this spring, and it drops at the plate and shows flashes of becoming a third plus offering. PERSON also have liked how PERSON has firmed up his large frame, which looked soft at times in 2015. He has good body control for a big kid and does a nice job of repeating a delivery that doesn't feature much effort. There were some initial concerns about the ORGANIZATION State recruit's signability, but he has pushed himself high enough in the Draft to where it shouldn't be an issue.",0
"As the 2017 draft approached, it seemed like there was a strong possibility that PERSON would matriculate to GSP. It was unclear if circumstances would align in such a way that he'd find a home; it would take a team that had a strong evaluation of PERSON (some teams were more apt to project on his fastball than others), a pick near where his talent level made sense, and the pool space to coax him away from college. It turned out the ORGANIZATION were that team, and PERSON signed for $2.1 million, about $400,000 over slot, as a second rounder. After a year and a half of pro ball, PERSON's stuff is basically the same. His fastball resides in the low-90s and he'll show you an above-average curveball and changeup once in a while. He has better command than is usual for a pitcher this age and size, so he comfortably projects as a starter, likely of the ORGANIZATION. 4 or 5 variety.",0
" The ORGANIZATION hoped they were getting a good-hitting high school bat when they nabbed PERSON with an above-slot deal in 2011, but they don't really know what they have yet because he hasn't been able to see much time in actual games so far. He signed late and played in just eight games after being drafted, then missed the entire 2012 season with a shoulder injury that required surgery. When PERSON is healthy, he has a line-drive approach from the left side of the plate, and the hope is he can develop into a Major League average hitter. He doesn't project to have much power, but could have a little extra-base pop. PERSON's speed, a tick above average, should help in that regard as well and be of use in the outfield to boot. He has good range and hands, and his arm is approaching average. PERSON has the chance to be an above-average defender, either in center or left, but more than anything, he just needs to go out and play.",1
"The younger brother of former GPE first-rounder PERSON, PERSON stood out mostly for his defense during his first two years at ORGANIZATION before breaking out at the plate as a junior, leading to his selection by the ORGANIZATION in the fifth round of the 2015 ORGANIZATION. After he signed for $335,400, PERSON took the Class A Short PERSON by storm, winning ORGANIZATION honors and leading the league in average (.358), stolen bases (47), on-base percentage (.432) and runs scored (64). As a result of his success, the ORGANIZATION sent PERSON to Class A Advanced Bakersfield to begin his first full season. PERSON hit a collective .184 between his freshman and sophomore seasons with the ORGANIZATION, and his offensive struggles carried over to the 2014 Cape Cod League, where he hit just .196 with his ORGANIZATION stock on the line. But things came together for him as a junior, and he continued to make strides at the plate in his pro debut after he shortened his swing. He's a disciplined hitter and makes a lot of contact, which in turn allows him to utilize his plus wheels. While he'll never offer much in the way of power, PERSON did show more consistent pop to the gaps in the LOCATION League.Defensively, PERSON shouldn't have trouble sticking at shortstop, where he profiles as an above-average defender with soft hands, good range and an absolute cannon for an arm. Though still has quite a bit to prove at the plate in spite of his impressive pro debut, PERSON could turn out to be one of the biggest steals of the 2015 ORGANIZATION with another strong showing in his first full season.",0
"Up to 94 as a high school underclassman, PERSON was tracking like a traditional first round PERSON high school arm until he had PERSON and missed all but one game during his senior year. He was a wild card on draft day, but ended up going in the third round, and signing for early second round money ($1.7 million). During his first pro summer, PERSON's fastball velocity climbed from the 88-91 range up to the 92-94 area. Then, shoulder and biceps issues plagued his first two full pro seasons and his stuff was down in 2018. 
This spring, he was throwing harder than ever, sitting 94-97 at times, and showing better breaking stuff than he had previously. He's struggling to harness the new stuff, but he hasn't really pitched all that much due to all those injuries, and that he has a chance for four above-average pitches gives him more upside than a lot of the closer, safer prospects on this list. He could have a breakout summer, or it could be very bumpy.",0
"PERSON flew under the radar in the 2014 Draft as a 14th-round pick out of the ORGANIZATION of Texas-San Antonio before a solid 2015 full-season debut in the LOCATION, giving the ORGANIZATION hope that perhaps they got more than they bargained for in the big right-hander.At 6-foot-3, 205 pounds, PERSON has a low leg lift and an early break of the hands that gives his fastball -- thrown in the 90-94 mph range and sitting around 92 mph -- some natural deception. He throws it with more angle than outright sink, but he does throw downhill and generates groundballs. PERSON threw two breaking balls in college, but the ORGANIZATION made him shelve his curveball and focus on his slider, which is improving, though he still struggles to throw it consistently. Add in a changeup and PERSON does have the chance to have a three-pitch mix at his disposal. PERSON is a starter or reliever long-term will depend on how much he can improve the consistency of his breaking ball and his overall command, though the ORGANIZATION are pleased with his work ethic and ability to make adjustments thus far in his career.",0
"GPE is a 2018 undrafted free agent senior sign who had a 2019 breakout. He began the year in the Low-A bullpen (50 K, 9 BB in 35 innings), then in June was moved to the rotation and thrived for twelve starts. He made a few late-August starts at Hi-A, and was good there, too. GPE has fastball command and a plus changeup. He's a little light on velocity, only sitting 90-93, but he's garnered swings and misses at that velocity at the top of the strike zone so far. His changeup has bat-eluding sink and fade, and it get used against righty hitters. GPE's breaking ball is just okay, but he can land it for strikes to start counts. It's a 40-man look, to be sure. Perhaps the velo would uptick in the bullpen (all our GPE info comes from folks who've seen him start) in an interesting way, but for now GPE projects in the 5th/6th starter area.",0
"GPE school pitchers from places like PERSON are invariably long-term projects. The ORGANIZATION knew this when they drafted ORGANIZATION, but they they thought it was a project worth taking on and going well over pick-value to do it.It might be a slow process with PERSON, but it's easy to see why the ORGANIZATION think there's a lot to tap into. He has good size at 6-foot-4 and has already seen an uptick in velocity, up to the 90-93 mph range. He uses his size well to throw downhill and there's even some deception due to a three-quarters arm slot. He throws a curve and a changeup and while both need work, he's shown a feel for each secondary offering . An ability to repeat his delivery should help him find the strike zone consistently.Talking about PERSON as a potential big league contributor would be extremely premature at this point, but with his potential, don't be shocked if he's in that conversation in the future.",0
"One scout compared GPE to J.P. PERSON, but meant it as the amateur verion of PERSON, who lasted until the 16th pick in 2013 for a reason. GPE is also an above average to plus runner, fielder and thrower that can stick at shortstop comofortable and also has a bigger frame for the position that gives him a little more pop than usual. The question with GPE, and with PERSON as an amateur, is about his swing and how much offensive impact there will be. Obviously, PERSON has answered this question as well and as quickly as anyone could expect, but that's the obvious best case scenario for this type of prospect. The ORGANIZATION are believed to have have a deal with GPE for $2 million.",0
"Acquired by PERSON from the ORGANIZATION at the ORGANIZATION in July 2015, GPE excelled at the Double-A and Triple-A levels in '16 to earn a big league callup in August at age 22. However, shoulder fatigue combined with a team-imposed inning cap limited the right-hander to just five starts with the ORGANIZATION, who then sent him and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION for '14 first-rounder PERSON in late November. He returned to the big leagues in 2017 with GPE, but also missed considerable time with leg and knee injuries early in the season before taking the rest of the year off in July to address mental health issues.GPE pitches with an average fastball, sitting at 90-93 mph, but it plays up thanks to heavy sinking action that yields a high number of ground balls. His curveball is his lone above-average pitch, and he also mixes in a slider and a usable changeup. The right-hander is around the strike zone with all of his pitches and knows how to keep hitters off balance and guessing by effectively changing speeds.With an advanced feel for four pitches as well as a bulldog mentality on the mound, GPE shows the makings of becoming a backend starter at maturity. Perhaps more importantly, GPE, after receiving treatment for depression and anxiety that affected him for much of 2017, has returned to the game as an advocate for mental health and hopes to change its stigma within the sport.",1
"The GPE landed several promising pitchers with six-figure bonuses in the deeper rounds of the 2011 Draft, led by PERSON (14th round, $250,000), who already has had success in GPE. PERSON (19th, $350,000), PERSON (18th, $325,000) and PERSON (16th, $150,000) have pitched well in the upper levels of the system and soon could join PERSON in the big leagues.PERSON doesn't have a true plus pitch but he has a chance to have three average or better offerings. His 89-92 mph fastball can reach 94 and plays up because it features armside run. His solid changeup is often his best weapon and he also works with an average slider.Though PERSON made significant strides with his control and command in 2014, his walk rate increased again this season. His athleticism leads the GPE to believe he'll be able to make the necessary adjustments and develop into a No. 3 or 4 starter.",1
"Announced as a second baseman when the ORGANIZATION drafted him, and deployed primarily in left field as a pro, PERSON's stiffness and immobility will likely limit him to first base, where he played in college. He has sufficient power to profile there but there have been questions about the contact since high school. He clubbed 22 homers in 2018, mostly at Hi-A, and will force some re-evaluation if he has a big year at Double-A. For now, he projects as a bench bat with limited defensive flexibility.",0
"PERSON got on the national scouting radar when he had a strong performance at ORGANIZATION early during his draft spring, during which he hit 95 mph. He was scouted the rest of the spring but often sat 88-91 and hit 93 mph, working with a solid average changeup as his out-pitch, and a fringy breaking ball that comes and goes with his arm speed, stuff befitting a seventh round selection. 
PERSON changed a bit in pro ball, switching from a curveball to slider, and made that his primary off-speed pitch. His performance, despite below average velocity, was excellent thereafter and he surprised many when he went from Hi-A to the big leagues to start 2019. He's probably a back-end starter, a No. 4/5 at best, but the finished product came together much quicker than anyone expected and some of it happened with pitch development and adjustment, evidence PERSON will be able to continue making relevant tweaks as it becomes pertinent.",1
"PERSON excelled both as a closer and starter at the ORGANIZATION of GPE before the PERSON made him their second-round pick in 2012. He got off to a strong start in '15 in his first Double-A campaign, only to suffer an early-season elbow injury for which he received a platelet-rich plasma injection. PERSON's elbow continued to bother him that fall during instructional league play -- leading to PERSON surgery that would cost him all of '16 -- while a pair of arthroscopic surgeries to address lodged tissue in the joint line in his right elbow kept him off the mound again in '17. Finally healthy to begin '18, PERSON ended a 59-month absence on the mound when he logged a scoreless performance out of Class A Advanced PERSON's bullpen on PERSON Opening Day. PERSON, when healthy, boasts an impressive fastball-slider pairing. He's shown the same velocity in 2018 as he did pre-injury, sitting in the low- to mid-90s and bumping 97-98 mph while using his 6-foot-3 frame to create a downhill angle to the plate. PERSON's slider is inconsistent at times but highly effective against right-handed hitters, giving him a two-pitch combo that's ideal for late-inning bullpen work. He'll also mix in the occasional changeup. PERSON has long been a strike-thrower, but will need to refine his command after his extended layoff.A starting pitcher prior to his injuries, PERSON was shifted to the bullpen ahead of his return and has quickly impressed in the new role, showing a combination of size, stuff and feel that has him back on track toward reaching the Major Leagues.",0
"PERSON was under the scouting radar until a breakout campaign on Cape Cod, during which both he and teammate PERSON (a second round pick by the ORGANIZATION) emerged as top tier bats in the 2018 draft. During the spring, PERSON steadily worked his way up from the late first round to the third overall pick by hitting more than scouts expected a long-limbed power threat to hit. PERSON pulls this off by keeping his arms tucked in during his swing and having a flatter plane; as a result he's both quicker into the zone and in the zone longer than most power hitters. Ideally, hitters with PERSON's plus-plus power have more loft in their swing plane and extend their arms to generate the most power, with PERSON an example of a hitter with a similar frame and this more power-focused approach. We're projecting PERSON as a 50 bat with 60 game power and split the difference a bit--he could go even more extreme for power at the expense of contact--but there are a number of ways this offensive skillset could turn out, particularly with new and more progressive hitting instruction this year for the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's defense also could go a few different ways, depending how much weight he adds to his lean frame and how his lateral quickness ages. Defensively, PERSON looks major league average at times and clearly below average at others, but he'll get plenty of chances to make things work at third base.",0
"Outside of perhaps left-handed high school pitching, there may not be more depth in this class than what the crop of prep catchers has to offer. ORGANIZATION, who had a big summer with PERSON's gold-medal winning 18 and under team, might be the best of the lot. ORGANIZATION is a strong-bodied, left-handed-hitting catcher, which is always in high demand. With an easily above-average arm and fast exchange, he has the catch-and-throw skills to stay behind the plate.More of an all-out effort type than a natural performer, there is still some projection to his frame, so there might be more power to come. That could make him a very good all-around backstop in the future, one who carried over a very strong summer to his spring in the ORGANIZATION, keeping him very much in the first-round picture.",1
"ORGANIZATION's batted ball profile shifted dramatically after the ORGANIZATION acquired him from the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION Chapman deal. Since high school, he had been a feel-for-contact corner guy with batting practice power that didn't manifest in games, but the ORGANIZATION got his ground ball rate down from 42% to 30% and he started to mash before they flipped him to GPE for ORGANIZATION. He hit for power in a prolonged big league look but struggled badly against breaking stuff, something that may be an issue moving forward. ORGANIZATION doesn't have a whole lot of offensive wiggle room because he's so limited on defense, but the hit/power combo suggests he is a ORGANIZATION Smith-like corner platoon bat who's ready right now.",1
" When the ORGANIZATION signed PERSON out of GPE in 2011, scouts liked the 16-year-old's size and power potential. But he went homerless in his first three professional seasons, while his natural hitting ability proved to be better than advertised. He'll try to unlock his power with a new organization, as the D-backs acquired him in April in exchange for a competitive balance PERSON pick. PERSON has a good understanding of the strike zone and solid on-base skills, and he makes a lot of contact. His projectable frame and good bat speed give scouts optimism that he will add more power as he physically matures. Speed isn't a big part of his game, but he's savvy enough to run when he gets the chance.After primarily playing left field in his first two professional seasons, PERSON moved to right field in 2014. His defense remains a work in progress, but if he makes the strength gains he's expected to, he could develop into a prototypical corner outfielder in time.",1
"In the previous 10 Drafts, six GPE high school pitchers have gone in the first three rounds, most notably PERSON (ORGANIZATION, first round, 2007). The latest product of that pipeline is PERSON, who comes from a small prep school that never has had a player drafted.PERSON has a big frame with projectability remaining. He usually pitches at 90-92 mph with his fastball and has reached 94, which he should do more regularly as he fills out. His heater has run and sink as well, and he does a nice job of using his height to throw it on a steep downward plane.While PERSON's curveball can be inconsistent, it has some power to it and plenty of depth when it's on. He's still working on his changeup and his command. He has committed to GPE.",0
"PERSON was a big name out of high school, reportefly turning down seven figures to go to PERSON knowing he would be an eligible sophomore due to his age. He's had an up-and-down spring, coming out of the chute blazing hot, leading to top-10 pick momentum for the first month of the season, then slowly regressing in performance, fastball command and changeup usage. Most scouts think PERSON needs a delivery adjustment in pro ball to make himself more online to the plate as a way to improve his fastball command. That would likely tease out a bit more performance from PERSON's above-average stuff, but he's been too reliant on his plus curveball. To that point, hitters late in the season would sit on the pitch, knowing he had trouble locating his fastball and he barely threw his changeup, including his disastrous outing at GPE where he allowed 11 runs. PERSON has interest as high as 11th overall to GPE and a couple other spots in the teens, but his mixed second half of the season has his likely range more in the 20s.",0
"A Minnesota native, PERSON became PERSON's closer as a freshman. He has steadily improved since then and eventually pitched his way into the role of the ORGANIZATION ace. When the ORGANIZATION selected him 18th overall in June, PERSON became PERSON's first ever first-round pick. He impresses scouts with his stuff, size and command. PERSON throws his fastball in the low- to mid-90s and touched 97 mph this spring. He uses his height to create a good downward plane and pounds the zone. He has good offspeed stuff and is capable of generating swings and misses with his changeup as well as his breaking ball. While PERSON's peak fastball velocity suggests he could be a frontline starter, most scouts think he can at least become a middle-of-the-rotation starter in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON was in the Others of GPE section on this list last year, third amongst the 2017 July 2nd signees, none of whom had played a pro game at the time. But PERSON had the strongest 2018 of the group, and he arguably already had the loudest tools. He was one of the best performing amateur hitters from GPE in his signing class (just ahead of PERSON, who's further down this list), and he was also a plus runner who could've been converted to catcher given his quickness, arm strength, and squatty, powerful frame. But the ORGANIZATION didn't want to slow down his bat by asking him to learn to catch. Some scouts who had a one or two game look at this summer didn't love PERSON's non-projectable frame, and they rounded down if he didn't hit in those short looks. But those who saw him for more than a few games saw the advanced bat amateur scouts saw. 
One enthusiastic scout described PERSON's running as plus, though he's not the typically graceful, long striding plus runner. That scout he said had a 'grinding gait, full effort, kicking up grass as he runs like the rooster tail of a speed boat.' In addition to potential plus hit and run tools, there's above-average arm strength and raw power, and now the start of a strong statistical performance record. And if things go askew at the plate, the notion that PERSON could catch is interesting. One ORGANIZATION source described PERSON as an 80 makeup guy, often a prerequisite to consider sending a player behind the plate He's a well-rounded offensive player who looks like an up-the-middle defensive fit of some kind. He may be a top 100 prospect by mid season.",0
"PERSON is listed as a shortstop, but he has a wide range of skills that would allow him to play a different position in the future if necessary. He's been compared to a young PERSON Ramirez.The 6-foot-1, 175-pound middle infielder is known for his strong and athletic body. He has a good arm with soft hands and playable range on defense. He can make the routine plays and the occasional extraordinary play. PERSON is also considered a strong runner.What's more, PERSON is considered an offensive-minded player who shows good bat speed and features a slight uppercut swing. He makes lots of hard contact during batting practice and has the ability to show the power in games. There's the belief that PERSON could be better suited for third base or a corner outfield position, but he'll likely get every opportunity to show that he can stay in the middle of the diamond on defense as he develops.PERSON is trained by PERSON in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"Just 19 years old this season, PERSON has already started to turn heads. He has plus-plus speed, which he puts to good use on the base paths and in center field. He swiped 33 bases in 68 games in the ORGANIZATION in 2012 and has plus range in the outfield. At the plate, PERSON uses his compact swing to hit line drives. He is a patient hitter and walked more than he struck out in the ORGANIZATION. As he physically matures, PERSON may develop power. If not, he profiles as a leadoff hitter.",1
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in 2007, PERSON spent his first five pro seasons and part of a sixth in GPE ball. After finally reaching Triple-A in late April, he cracked the ORGANIZATION' 40-man roster in August with his first callup to the big leagues.Though PERSON has spent much of his ORGANIZATION career as a starter, he has a brighter future as a reliever. He usually works at 92-95 mph as part of a rotation, and he's reached 99 coming out of the bullpen. PERSON' No. 2 pitch is a hard cutter/slider that pushes the upper 80s.PERSON has funky mechanics that often hamper his control and command. He shows some aptitude for a changeup and often throws it too hard, and he tips off his curveball by slowing down his delivery. PERSON might be better off by shifting to relief and focusing on his two best pitches.",0
" PERSON was a starter at FACILITY and threw a no-hitter to beat ORGANIZATION and PERSON in 2011. He has battled injuries throughout his career and underwent PERSON surgery in 2010. His health issues scared teams again on the eve of the 2011 Draft when he was pulled from his start in the ORGANIZATION after one inning because of elbow and back discomfort. PERSON has PERSON stuff when he's healthy and could be a starter. His injury history, however, makes him a better fit in the bullpen, where his power arsenal makes him a potential high-impact reliever. PERSON throws his fastball in the upper-90s and mixes it with a solid slider and changeup. He reached Double-A Richmond this year and is moving quickly toward PERSON.",0
"There are often expectations for a college lefty, especially from a program like ORGANIZATION, to move quickly through a Minor League system. In that regard, PERSON hasn't measured up. At the same time, though, the southpaw led the ORGANIZATION State League and came in second in the ORGANIZATION in strikeouts over his first two full seasons.Not completely a finesse pitcher, PERSON combines solid stuff with a good feel for pitching. He'll feature a fastball that's a touch above-average, commanding it well with sink to generate ground-ball outs and adding to and subtracting from it. He has the chance to throw a true curve in the future, but he'll get on the side of it and it takes on a different shape as a result. He throws a slider as well, especially against lefties, though the ORGANIZATION think the curve will be his better breaking ball eventually. His changeup gives him another offering that's slightly above-average. He throws all of his pitches for strikes and his command should only improve over time.While he doesn't have the highest ceiling in the world, PERSON isn't too far from reaching it. After moving slowly, it may not take him that much more time to be ready to contribute to a big league rotation.",0
"A young, polished, but relatively unexplosive high schooler, GPE was a bit of a surprise second rounder in 2017 but has quickly become much more interesting thanks to a sterling 2018 season with PERSON. As a 19-year-old, he hit .352/.405/.511 for the ORGANIZATION, torching even the loftiest of expectations set by scouts who saw him during extended spring training and mostly considered GPE a future utility man. Fundamentally sound at short, he lacks the explosiveness and big arm strength scouts look for at the position, and we wonder if GPE will hit for enough power to be an impact player at any other position. 
His early career strikeout rate (7.5% in about 450 PA) suggests his bat-to-ball skills are even more promising than amateur scouts anticipated, though he's also an aggressive swinger who has been hit by nearly twice as many pitches as he has walks so far. When scouts talk about a player having 'feel, polish, instincts' and the like, and the player has numbers like GPE's contact rates, we typically round up on that player. In GPE's case, we remain cautious because the eyeball scouts are so resolute in their skepticism of the power projection.",0
"The ORGANIZATION paid PERSON $250,000 to turn pro as a 17th-rounder at the signing deadline in 2010. Sixteen months later, they shipped him and PERSON to the FACILITY for PERSON. He was on the move last December, sent to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON. 3 came in late March when he was sent to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION Holaday deal.Without a true out pitch, PERSON relies on mixing his three-pitch repertoire and an improved ability to pitch to contact. His fastball sits in the 91-93 mph with good movement. His slider has some bite and he can throw his changeup with sink. He's become more aggressive within the zone and cutting down his walk rate.PERSON doesn't have a high ceiling, but he is almost ready to reach it. He could be a No. 4 or 5 starter or a middle reliever in the near future.",0
"Initially thought to become part of the ORGANIZATION organization during the last international signing period when he was declared a free agent in January, PERSON eventually did sign in July. Ranked No. 7 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 international prospects list, the ORGANIZATION blew past their international pool money by giving the 22-year-old PERSON shortstop $7 million to sign.A high energy player who is thought of as a glove-first prospect with excellent speed, PERSON was the 2014-15 PERSON of the Year in GPE and a former gold glove winner there. His speed allows him to have excellent range to go along with his outstanding hands. He has more than enough arm to stay at shortstop long-term. PERSON is making progress with the bat and the ORGANIZATION think he's going to hit at the highest level. His speed should allow him to be a basestealing threat as well.PERSON gets high marks for his confidence and makeup, things that should allow him to transition fairly easily to the game in this country, eventually developing into an everyday shortstop.",0
GPE is a 70 runner with 50 raw power that can passably play all three positions up the middle but his swing mechanics and skills can't match his tools.,0
"PERSON led ORGANIZATION prepsters in homers for three straight years and offered some of the best power among high school middle infielders in the 2014 Draft, but a so-so senior season and signability issues left him unselected and headed to PERSON. He barely played as a freshman before swatting 11 homers as a first baseman in 2016, after which the ORGANIZATION drafted him in the 26th round. Though he suffered facial fractures in a preseason scrimmage as a junior, PERSON recovered to set a new career high with 19 homers before going to the A's in the second round.Since his high school days, PERSON has impressed with his bat speed and strength. He's now tapping into his pop better than ever after shortening his left-handed swing and employing a more selective approach. He's also using the whole field more, making more consistent contact and drawing more walks.A shortstop in high school, PERSON's below-average speed and quickness limited his defensive options at higher levels. He's finding a home in right field, where he could become close to an average defender with more experience. His solid arm strength is suited for the position.",0
" The captain of the 15-and-under team from GPE that won a championship in GPE last August, PERSON is one of the top shortstops on the market.Scouts say PERSON is a solid defender with only a slightly above-average arm, but he is very polished for his age and can be counted on to make the routine plays. Moreover, PERSON has been praised for his fluid movements on the field and his reliable hands, leading many to believe that he will stay at shortstop as he grows and develops.The infielder has a line-drive swing to all fields and has been called a typical two-hole hitter, despite what has been referred to as ""limited power."" He has average running speed, but he's a good baserunner. There is some concern about PERSON's body type and durability, but his biggest supporters are hoping he gets stronger as he ages. PERSON trains with former ORGANIZATION shortstop PERSON in GPE.",0
" Considered the top prep pitcher in the 2012 Draft class, PERSON slid after he was shut down early that March by a sprained ulnar collateral ligament. He ultimately underwent PERSON surgery after the ORGANIZATION selected him and didn't pitch a full professional season until 2014. The time off didn't stop him from dominating hitters, and his performance earned him a spot in the ORGANIZATION. Armed with three above-average offerings, PERSON does a good job of keeping hitters off balance. His fastball sits in the mid to upper 90s and has touched 100 mph. He throws his 12-to-6 curveball with a lot of power, and it is nearly as good as his fastball. He has made strides with his changeup, turning it into a true weapon against left-handers. PERSON is an elite talent with the stuff, size and pitching acumen to develop into an ace. As the ORGANIZATION continue to loosen his reins, he should start moving faster through the ORGANIZATION.",1
"A twiggy, projectable lefty, PERSON struck out a batter per inning in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League at age 19. He's flexible and loose, currently sitting 87-93 with a four and two-seamer that PERSON complements with a slurvy breaking ball and immature changeup. Much of PERSON's future depends on how much velocity comes as he matures. Realistically, he ends up with a bevy of average pitches and pitches toward the back of a rotation.",0
"PERSON was making a name for himself as the Friday starter for ORGANIZATION this spring.Tall and lean, the right-hander has the makings of a three-pitch mix with some knowledge of how to use it well. He can touch 94 mph with his fastball, though typically he'll sit a touch below that. PERSON complements his fastball, which has heavy cut to it, with a strong slider. His fastball cuts so much, it's almost like he throws two sliders. He throws a changeup as well, though not as frequently.If PERSON's changeup develops, he could be a starter, but with his competitive nature on the mound and his cutter-slider combination, he could be a Mariano Rivera-like quick-to-the-big leagues setup man or closer type.",1
"After being drafted by the ORGANIZATION in 2009, PERSON was included in the GPE ORGANIZATION deal in December '10. After a disappointing start to his GPE career, PERSON broke out in '13, playing in the ORGANIZATION and making his Major League debut later that year. Another subpar season in 2014 was followed by his second trade, this one to the ORGANIZATION, in November.PERSON' swing is geared toward making contact, and his on-base skills made strides in 2013. He has well-below-average power, but he makes up for it with plus speed, and he's stolen at least 35 bases in each of his four full professional seasons. PERSON covers ground well in center field, and he has an average arm.Even if PERSON' bat doesn't further develop, he has speed, athleticism and defensive skills, which everyone knows the ORGANIZATION value.",1
"GPE and lean with dream-worthy frame, GPE is raw in all facets of baseball but at times shows glimpses of a future at shortstop and the body allows for projection on his bat.",0
"PERSON has been the youngest member of the pitching staff in each of the past two years, but he has held his own. The ORGANIZATION native was something of a late-bloomer, and scouts believe there is still room for projection in his big frame.PERSON's fastball already sits around 90 mph, and he mixes it with a solid changeup. His curveball has made strides this year, becoming a much more consistent offering. PERSON has a good feel for the zone, and he throws all of his pitches for strikes.The Indians think PERSON's size, stuff and feel for pitching will help him develop into a solid starter.",0
GPE lefty who was up to 95 last summer but has been mostly 89-92 this spring. Has a chance for two average breaking balls and a viable changeup. ,0
"The son of former big league player and manager and current GPE bench coach PERSON, PERSON has the advanced instincts expected from someone who grew up around the game. He also has an intriguing toolset as well and could be a top-three-rounds pick if he's considered signable away from his commitment to Rice.A switch-hitter, PERSON shows a quick bat and good approach from both sides of the plate. He shows power potential from both sides as well -- perhaps more as a lefty despite being a natural righty -- and should begin to realize it once he fills out his 6-foot-3 frame.An average runner with a solid, accurate arm and defensive savvy, PERSON may be able to stay at shortstop. Even if he can't, he has enough quickness to profile at second base and the bat to handle the offensive demands at third base.",0
"In addition to his high school baseball stardom, Thompson-Williams was a good wide receiver and safety in GPE, GPE. It's rare that an athlete like this gets to college at all, let alone a junior college, but ORGANIZATION spent the first two years of his college career at FACILITY JC, then transferred to GPE, where he answered any lingering questions about whether he could translate his raw athleticism into on-field performance against pro-level competition. 
He had a breakout 20/20 season at Hi-A last year, albeit as a 23-year-old. He has big raw power but there are questions about how readily he'll be able to get to it in games, and teams have varying opinions about whether or not he can stay in center field. Thereâs low-end everyday upside if things continue to come together at the plate the way they did in 2018. More likely, Thompson-Williams is a useful platoon at multiple outfield spots, or as a player who can provide some thump and speed off the bench. Given his shorter track record and age, thatâs a 40 FV for now with a chance to turn into a 45 FV with upper-level performance, which would reinforce notions that his 2018 on-paper production was real.",0
"One of the more unusual players in the minors, PERSON has long been considered a likely bench outfielder due to his complete lack of power, but his other tools may prove to be so strong that he finds his way into an everyday role for someone. 
PERSON has one of the lowest Pull% in pro baseball, as only 27% of balls he puts in play are to his pull side. His 70-grade speed plays like an 80 from home to first, as his swing has a natural jailbreak that gets him out of the box very quickly. He lead the minors with 70 stolen bases last year, his closing speed is very valuable in center field, and PERSON is a tough out thanks to his feel for the strike zone and bat control. Players like this occasionally turn into PERSON or PERSON and provide sizeable everyday value. PERSON's skillset indicates this sort of future is a possibility, but not a likelihood, and chances are he's either a low-end regular in center or good fourth outfielder.",1
"Once thought to be among the best in a very deep high school catching crop coming out of the GPE class of 2013, PERSON's up-and-down senior season resulted in a slide to the third round. He could end up being a steal for the ORGANIZATION, who went just over $200,000 above pick value to sign PERSON. He's shown glimpses of a complete package behind and at the plate. He has some definite pop and has the potential to hit for average and power. He has a plus arm behind the plate and while will have to continue to hone his craft, he should develop decent all-around receiving skills. If that part of his game continues to come, he has the chance to be an everyday catcher at the highest level.",0
"The A's signed PERSON for $2.2 million in 2010 based on his right-handed power potential. He's shown plenty of it in the Minors, hitting at least 18 home runs at each full-season level, and he became the youngest non-pitcher to play for the A's since PERSON in 2008 when he made his big league debut last September. It was a disappointing season for PERSON overall, though, as he posted the lowest average of his career (.228) while moving down the defensive spectrum in Triple-A. The 2017 season has brought slightly better results for the ORGANIZATION native, as he surpassed his home run total from the previous in just a half season in GPE Coast League, where he was named a midseason All-Star.PERSON generates plus raw power thanks to a combination of bat speed and physical strength, but he sells out for it too often, employing a pull-heavy approach that limits the overall utility of his bat. He made strides with his plate discipline at Double-A in 2015, only to regress last season with the move up to Triple-A, where his strikeout rate increased by nearly 6 percent from the previous year. PERSON's strikeout rate continued to spike in 2017, casting even greater doubt about his ability to hit for any semblance of average.PERSON's offensive struggles followed him into the field last season, as he led all GPE Coast League third basemen in errors (21) despite appearing in just 89 games at the hot corner. As a below-average defender and runner without a true position, PERSON profiles more as an up-and-down bench bat more than an everyday option.",1
"No ORGANIZATION high school position player ever has been selected in the top two rounds or 60 picks in the GPE, but PERSON could become the first this June. He's an infielder with a chance to have average or better tools across the board once he moves off shortstop, and scouts love his makeup as well. He has a track record of performing on the biggest amateur stages, helped PERSON win a gold medal at the 18-and-under World Cup in GPE last September and led PERSON (Omaha) to the ORGANIZATION Class A championship game while earning PERSON state player of the year honors this spring.With his quick, compact right-handed stroke, PERSON laces line drives to all fields. He added some strength before his senior season and drove the ball more consistently this spring, finishing among the national high school leaders with 14 home runs. He could be a .280 hitter with 15-18 homers per year in the big leagues.An average runner with good instincts on the bases and in the field, PERSON lacks the quickness and arm strength to play shortstop in pro ball. He should be able to handle the offensive and defensive responsibilities at either second or third base. One scout called the ORGANIZATION recruit a poor man's version of GPE rookie sensation PERSON, who was a supplemental first-rounder as a GPE high schooler in 2011.",0
"A ORGANIZATION high schooler signed for $100,000 in the 19th round of the 2014 Draft, PERSON spent two years in GPE ball before having a breakthrough of sorts in 2016. He led the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in hitting (.332) and total bases (113) while also stealing 11 bases.PERSON has a quick right-handed swing and does a nice job of using the entire field. He makes consistent contact and shows some patience at the plate. He has some strength and shows some pull power, but he's more likely to produce doubles than to become a big home run threat. While PERSON has above-average speed, he was caught stealing as much as he succeeded in the NY-P. He began his pro career in right field but spent most of 2016 in left field, where his fringy arm fits best. He has the instincts to become an average or better defender on the corner.",0
"GPE already had a strong high school crop for the 2015 Draft, and it got stronger when PERSON surfaced late in the spring. He didn't take the mound until mid-April, getting a late start because he played basketball and had some minor shoulder issues.A PERSON recruit, PERSON intrigues scouts with his projectable, athletic body and his feel for pitching. If he gets stronger and realizes his potential, he could be a lefty starter with the ability to throw three solid offerings for strikes.Though he carries just 170 pounds on his 6-foot-3 frame, PERSON already works at 88-91 mph and reaches 93 with good life and plane on his fastball. His curveball needs more power but has promising depth and he has advanced feel for his changeup. He also shows the aptitude to work both sides of the plate.",0
"The ORGANIZATION' 10th-round pick in the 2015 Draft, PERSON was a senior signed out of PERSON who received a $25,000 bonus. He operated mostly as a swingman early in his pro career and had a strong first full season, albeit as a 23-year-old in the Class A GPE ORGANIZATION. A move up to Class A Advanced Potomac the next year was met with struggles, and the ORGANIZATION shifted him to the bullpen full-time when he repeated the level in 2018. He took quickly to the new role, pitching increasingly well as the season progressed before an eye-opening performance in the ORGANIZATION. He pitched his way from Double- to Triple-A in 2019 when he was sent to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON Elias.After working in the low 90s during the regular season, PERSON's fastball was consistently 95-96 mph with improved late life in the ORGANIZATION. He has an above-average slider, thrown in the mid-80s with good depth, and also can mix in a fringy changeup. He has below-average control of all three pitches, though it stands to improve as he becomes more comfortable with his improved stuff out of the bullpen. PERSON dominated same-sided hitters in the ORGANIZATION with his fastball-breaking ball combo, holding them to a .184 average without allowing an extra-base hit in 54 plate appearances. Such success highlights PERSON's potential as a left-handed specialist, though he'll first have to improve his control as he navigates the upper Minors.",0
"The D-backs selected PERSON 70th overall in the 2014 Draft out of ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION.) High, luring him away from a commitment to ORGANIZATION with a $750,000 bonus. After hitting .187 in his pro debut, the GPE native bounced back in '15 to capture ORGANIZATION honors in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION, posting a .360/.436/.640 batting line with 13 home runs in 68 games for PERSON. He also led the league in slugging, extra-base hits (44) and doubles (25). Following his ORGANIZATION campaign, PERSON was sent to PERSON in a package to acquire PERSON and right-hander PERSON Wagner.A left-handed hitter, PERSON's combination of plus bat speed and strong bat-to-ball skills enables him to make hard contact and drive the ball with authority across the whole field. He tweaked his swing during the offseason so as to create more leverage through the hitting zone, and the adjustment allowed him to tap into his impressive raw power in games more consistently. While the approach is advanced for his age, and he's not afraid to take a walk, PERSON did a better job of being more selectively aggressive last year in his sophomore campaign.PERSON has below-average speed but runs the bases well, with scouts praising his instincts and knack for getting good jumps. He has spent most of his professional career at shortstop but profiles as more of a second baseman at the highest level, where his range, speed and arm strength are a cleaner fit. That said, PERSON's value at either middle-infield spot will be tied to his production.After raking in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON is ready to make his full-season debut in 2016. While he has a ways to go before reaching the ORGANIZATION, PERSON could emerge as one of the ORGANIZATION' top position prospects with another strong campaign.",1
"PERSON took a big step forward in 2014, his second season with the ORGANIZATION after coming from the Nationals in the ORGANIZATION trade. As much progress as he showed that season, he regressed in 2015, struggling with command and moving to the bullpen. He did have a bit more success as a reliever and had a short, unsuccessful big league debut. His 2016 campaign was short-lived due to shoulder issues. Even so, the ORGANIZATION liked his arm strength, and they got him from the ORGANIZATION for PERSON at the non-waiver PERSON. If he can return to health, PERSON still has premium velocity, with his upper-90s fastball coming from his 6-foot-9 frame getting on hitters quickly. He did try to dial it back at times last year in order to find the strike zone more consistently. When he's on his game, he misses bats and gets groundball outs thanks to the heavy sink on his heater. His power breaking ball is still a plus pitch and can put away hitters. In 2014, his changeup had improved to be a third very viable weapon, but it was inconsistent at best during his struggles.PERSON will be 27 in 2017, with his best bet to contribute at the big league level will be as a reliever. The big right-hander will have to show he's healthy and throw more strikes in order to be successful.",0
"For PERSON to be noticed as a prospect, he had to become a much smaller version of himself. While in high school, the infielder came in at around 285 pounds and realized he wasn't in shape for Division I baseball despite an offer from PERSON. After two years at ORGANIZATION, a two-year school, PERSON moved to UC-Irvine and weighed in at 215 lbs. He's put up some serious numbers in a pitching-friendly park to put himself firmly on the ORGANIZATION map.There's little doubt that it will be PERSON' bat that will carry him as a professional, and he has the chance to hit for power and average. The ball does not travel in his home park, but he was flirting with the school's single-season home run record as the ORGANIZATION approached. There is some length to his swing, and it can get grooved at times, which can be exposed, but scouts think he has the chance to hit enough to tap into his enormous raw power at the next level. He's a better athlete than he appears to be and has the hands to stay at third, though there's some concern his fringy arm won't work from the hot corner long term.Whether he sticks at third or has to move to first, PERSON is going to have to hit his way up to the big leagues. The good news is it looks like he might, with a ORGANIZATION Healy- or PERSON Hoskins-type career a possibility if it all clicks.",0
"The ORGANIZATION took college infielders with two of their first three picks in the 2015 Draft. The first was PERSON, taken in the first round out of GPE. The second was GPE, selected in the second round out of ORGANIZATION. A broken hand interrupted a strong '17 season and GPE's power started showing up in '18, leading to him joining GPE in the big leagues for the first time.For the first two years of his pro career, GPE used a contact-oriented approach to rise up to the upper levels of the system. He started tapping into his extra-base thump in 2017 before he got hurt and leveraged his swing more to clear more fences in '18. With that came more strikeouts, but that's not something the ORGANIZATION see as a huge red flag. GPE does need to work on his game plan more, as he does tend to guess at the plate too much. While he's played all three infield positions, he'll continue to see most of his playing time at second base, though he's fine at third with an arm that's bounced back to average.While still in the Minors, he'd have to play second over the hot corner in deference to the other top pick from 2015, Ke'Bryan Hayes, who was the high schooler taken between GPE and GPE. All three could impact the big league infield in '19 and beyond.",0
"The start of GPE's 2017 season sounded the alarm of re-evaluation as he struck out 22 hitters and walked four in his first 13.2 innings. Then he blew out his elbow and was on the shelf until the summer of 2018 to rehab from PERSON. 
When he returned, his stuff was back. His fastball sat 92-95 for most of his outings, dipping into the low end of that range later during his starts. It has some wiggle, as does a solid changeup that could be above-average with increased reps. But GPE's curveball is his best pitch. It's a timeless, rainbow curveball that arcs in at about 80 mph. It freezes hitters and garners swings and misses in the dirt to GPE's glove side. He has No. 3 or 4 starter stuff, we just haven't seen him hold it for a full season yet, and GPE is a 24-year-old with a surgery on his resume. There's a chance he's up at some point this year, but an innings limit might push his debut to 2020.",0
"Scouts considered GPE one of the best catchers available in the 2013 Draft, though he wasn't signable as a GPE high schooler and dropped to the ORGANIZATION in the 31st round. Three years later, he'll go in the first two rounds as one of the top backstop prospects in the 2016 class. In a league loaded with stars behind the plate, he has earned PERSON first-team honors in each of the last two seasons.GPE doesn't have a carrying tool, but he's more athletic than most catchers and could have four average tools when he's fully developed. His strength stands out more than his bat speed, and he has an offensive upside of hitting .260 with 15 homers per season. A veteran of five GPE national teams, GPE earns raves for his work ethic and ability to run a pitching staff. His catch-and-throw skills are fine, though his arm strength dipped a bit with PERSON's college squad during the summer. Though GPE is a below-average runner, he exhibits good instincts on the bases.",0
"Though he'll be 24 in May, the clay may not be totally dry on PERSON, who has several late bloomer traits. Tall, lanky, cold-weather arms often develop late; small-college players are typically a little behind large conference peers; and malleable athletes are  frequently able to make adjustments throughout their entire careers. PERSON is all of these. Originally from GPE, he pitched at three colleges in three years (ORGANIZATION, PERSON, and ORGANIZATION) in front of various groups of area scouts before he was drafted late in 2016. PERSON is also an ectomorphic 6-foot-4, and his limbs distract and also aid in his down-mound extension, enabling his fastball to sneak up on hitters more often than one would expect given its fringe velocity. PERSON learned the grip for his sinker, which has helped him generate a nearly 60% ground ball rate over the last two years, by seeing PERSON's grip on the internet. Scouts have also noted that he has begun to vary the timing of his delivery to disorient hitters, PERSON  la PERSON. He's clearly still developing and doing so quickly. His stuff -- the sinker, a good changeup, average slider -- looks like that of a swing man or up/down arm, and most pitchers this age with this kind of stuff don't end up on our lists. But that stuff might play up because of extension and deception and continue to improve as PERSON's body and feel for his craft evolve. He may end up as a core member of a pitching staff rather than just a depth arm.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON was one of 16 GPE baseball players to attend the ORGANIZATION. He has a side-saddle start in front of the rubber. His delivery is a simple lift and step, with some effort on his release. His control needs work, but the right-hander can get his fastball up to 93 mph and also has a curveball that clocks in at 76-77 mph.",0
"PERSON went to ORGANIZATION planning to play both football and baseball, but the school's football program was shut down when he got to campus, and he was drafted and signed by PERSON before it was reborn. He practiced with the team, but never suited up for a football game. 
2018 was his first year of full-time baseball and he hit .307/.378/.552 with 17 homers and 29 steals, albeit as a 22-year-old at Low-A. His strength/raw power and straight-line speed are what you'd probably expect from a college wide receiver, but PERSON's compact, in-game swing prioritizes contact. He's predictably raw and somewhat stiff rather than graceful and coordinated but he has physical ability, he plays really hard, and there's a chance some of the skill-based parts of the game come to him in his mid-20s.",0
"PERSON GPE has produced some sneaky good position players in recent years with PERSON (ORGANIZATION, fourth round, 2015) and PERSON (ORGANIZATION, third round, 2018). The next in line is PERSON, a 35th-round pick by the ORGANIZATION out of an PERSON high school three years ago. He's an up-the-middle player who can do a little bit of everything and should go in the same territory as PERSON and DeJong.A left-handed hitter, PERSON employed a more contact-oriented mentality in his first two college seasons. He began driving the ball more often and had success doing so with wood bats in the ORGANIZATION last summer, and he has tried to hit for more power this spring. With his current approach, he projects as a possible .270 hitter with 15 homers per season as a pro.PERSON's best tool is his speed, and he'll flash some plus-plus times but play more as a plus runner. He's still learning as a basestealer and shows just average instincts in center field, so he's not getting as much out of his quickness as he can. He has a fringy arm and it's not out of the question that he could wind up in left field and develop into a Brett Gardner type.",0
"An international signing at 17 years old from the ORGANIZATION in February 2013, it's been a longer road filled with patience by the ORGANIZATION' player development system as GPE learned how to use his tools and get closer to reaching his potential. His first full-season play didn't come until 2017 in the ORGANIZATION, and he struggled over much of the year.The 2018 season was a nice step forward for GPE as he repeated the ORGANIZATION in GPE to open the year before winding up in the ORGANIZATION State League with PERSON. Not only did GPE see his on-base percentage zoom upward with more walks, he kept his strikeout rate level and made more contact. The ORGANIZATION still left him unprotected after the season but did not lose him in the Rule 5 Draft.GPE is an athletic player with some very good tools but sometimes it depends on when you see him to see which tools will stand out on a given day. He has plus speed that enables him to run the bases well and cover a lot of ground in the outfield, mostly as a right fielder. At the plate, his approach has improved, with plenty of strength and bat speed. The switch hitter is starting to tap into his raw power and making good use of it while hitting more line drives. Now it's a matter of him continuing to improve his plate discipline before the organization can really see whether his bat will play.",0
"PERSON came on strong in the second half of his junior year at ORGANIZATION, and he continued to pitch well in Rookie-level Grand Junction after signing. That run continued in 2013, as he appeared in the ORGANIZATION and compiled a 1.80 ERA (the second-best mark in the ORGANIZATION) at three levels.PERSON throws his fastball in the mid-90s and can reach 99 mph. His wipeout slider is his best offspeed pitch, and his changeup and curveball give him a chance for four average-or-better offerings. PERSON has had command problems in the past, but his walk rate improved throughout 2013, and his loose, easy delivery should make it possible for him to pound the zone at a high rate.Before the GPE, some scouts thought PERSON might be a better fit in the bullpen. Those concerns have been quieted and he now has the look of a potential front-line starter.",1
"PERSON is a product of the GPE Baseball Academy and was set to play for LOCATION last year before he was declared ineligible. He transferred to ORGANIZATION this year and was a key piece of its lineup before the ORGANIZATION made him their second round selection. PERSON is a switch-hitter and has a good approach from either side of the plate. His swing doesn't create much loft, but he squares the ball up well. He was a catcher by trade, but a glut of catchers at ORGANIZATION and his versatility pushed him to third base. The ORGANIZATION have left him there for now, but will continue to work on catching with him and will decide on his future position in the offseason. No matter where he ends up, PERSON has the tools to be a capable defender. But it is his bat that will carry him through the ORGANIZATION.",1
"A 15th-round Draft pick in 2013 out of ORGANIZATION, PERSON wasn't considered much of a prospect during his first three pro seasons. He changed that perception in 2016 with a breakout performance at age 24 in the ORGANIZATION State League, and then he held his own the following year over a full season in the Double-A PERSON before a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION League.Though he stands a diminutive 5-foot-8, PERSON has excellent strength for his size and creates above-average bat speed from the right side. The result is sneaky power to all fields, though he does most of his damage to the pull side. That he finished third in walks in both the ORGANIZATION and EL in back-to-back years highlights his ability to control the strike zone and work deep counts, although his patient approach does lead to some swing-and-miss. PERSON' on-base skills also help him contribute on the basepaths, where his plus speed makes him a threat to steal 15-plus bases annually.PERSON spent much of his time between the outfield corners before shifting to center field in 2017. Though he took quickly to the position and made overall strides as a defender in the process, he's likely to be a better long-term fit in left field on account of his below-average arm. ORGANIZATION hasn't produced a big leaguer since 1991, but PERSON could very well end that drought if he continues down his current path.",0
"Regarded by many as the best defensive catcher in the 2016 Draft, PERSON has only strengthened his reputation as a pro. Originally a third-round pick by the ORGANIZATION, PERSON proved more than a just a gifted defender as he turned in a strong offensive performance in his first full season. Looking like he might be the total package as dual-threat catcher, the ORGANIZATION acquired PERSON with PERSON and PERSON in the August 2017 blockbuster for PERSON. Spending his first full season with the ORGANIZATION in Double-A, PERSON continued to showcase his defensive prowess but underwhelmed with the bat. PERSON' stellar defense is his ticket to the big leagues, and there's a large contingent of scouts and executives that believe there's no one better in the ORGANIZATION. He is an outstanding receiver and framer who is agile behind the plate and works well with pitchers. His plus, highly accurate arm and superb catch-and-throw skills enable him to shut down the running game, as he threw out 46 percent of attempted basestealers in his first full season followed by 56 percent (50 of 90) at ORGANIZATION in 2018.The leg kick in GPE' swing that served him well in 2017 detracted from his ability to hit in Double-A, where timing issues made him susceptible to good sequencing and resulted in too much swing-and-miss. When he did make contact, PERSON consistently hit the ball in the air, so there's reason to believe his above-average raw power will continue to play even if never hits for much average. Overall, it's the profile of at least a defensive-minded backup catcher in the big leagues, perhaps even a regular if he can unlock more of his potential with the bat.",1
An athletic backstop with a broad base of skills to match where the game is going.,0
"The Cardinals have shown a knack over the years for finding college talent in the later rounds, with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON as prime examples. While PERSON wasn't the same level of sleeper pick as a third-rounder out of GPE, after making it to Triple-A in his first full season, it's clear he's not far off from contributing like those others have.While PERSON doesn't have one plus tool, he can do a lot of things well, and better than one might think after a casual glance. With an aggressive approach at the plate, he doesn't get cheated, and while he's likely to never lose that attitude, he was open to tweaking his approach when Triple-A proved to be a bit more challenging for him. He has more power than one would think, with the chance to be PERSON average in that department at the highest level. He's a better defender than people gave him credit for, with the chance to stay in center field long term. With the free agent signing of PERSON, PERSON can't break in at that up-the-middle position. But after a strong ORGANIZATION showing and an impressive 2017 season in Triple-A, he appears ready to help out in any of the three outfield spots when the need arises.",1
" PERSON grew up in GPE, GPE, and became the second-highest GPEn native drafted when the ORGANIZATION took him in the fifth round out of LOCATION PERSON in 2012. He throws his fastball in the low to mid-90s and has been clocked as high as 97 mph. PERSON's best secondary pitch is his slider, which has a sharp break. He has been known mostly as a fastball-slider pitcher, but this year he has improved his curveball and changeup, giving him additional weapons to attack hitters with. PERSON's delivery has some effort to it, leading some scouts to think he is better suited for a bullpen role, where he could become a power reliever.",0
"PERSON began his college career at ORGANIZATION, struggling there for two years, especially as a starter during his sophomore season. He starred in the ORGANIZATION as a closer last summer, ahead of his transfer to PERSON, where he has continued to show off tremendous arm strength.The 6-foot-4 right-hander shows a premium fastball that typically touches 97-98 mph, and he's been able to maintain his velocity even as a starter this spring for PERSON. He throws two breaking balls, with his power 86-88 mph slider a better option than his 80-82 mph curveball, though he'll throw the latter more often. He does have a changeup, but it's well behind the other three pitches.Command has always been an issue for PERSON, even when he threw well out of the bullpen on the Cape. It's why many evaluators think a full-time return to a relief role makes the most sense at the next level, though there are some teams who might be willing to send him out as a starter to see if he can refine his delivery and control. But with his power stuff, if he can find the strike zone a bit more consistently, he has big league closer potential.",0
"The ORGANIZATION doubled down on shortstops at the outset of the 2012 international period, signing PERSON and PERSON ($725,000) on back-to-back days. PERSON has since become the A's top prospect after heading to GPE in the ORGANIZATION trade, leaving PERSON as the potential heir to the shortstop throne in GPE. He continued to climb the ladder in 2016, beginning the year back in the Class A Advanced PERSON and then reaching Double-A in August at age 20. Just three years removed from becoming a swing-hitter, PERSON shows good feel for the barrel from both sides of the plate with loose, twitchy wrists and good bat speed. He drives the ball more consistently as a lefty -- the side from which he's hit all but two of his home runs since the beginning of 2015 -- and should continue to add strength as he grows into his wiry-athletic frame. His right-handed swing is less impactful but yields consistent contact. PERSON saw both his strikeout and walk rates trend in a position direction in 2016, though he still has gains to make with his approach and pitch selection.Defensively, PERSON has the athleticism, range and plus arm to stick at shortstop but is lacking in finesse at the position and commits too many errors out of a lack of focus. That all should improve with experience, though, especially since PERSON has been a considerably younger player at every level.",1
"Only two Alabama high school catchers ever have been selected in the first three rounds, and it hasn't happened in the last 50 years. Rated the top prep backstop in the 2019 Draft by some teams, PERSON could join PERSON (PERSON, second round, 1966) and PERSON (FACILITY, third, 1968) in that exclusive club. His talent and the relative lack of catching available this year is pushing him up boards.PERSON's two most impressive tools are his raw power and pure arm strength, both of which grade as plus. He's a left-handed hitter whose strength and aggressive, pull-oriented mindset give him plenty of pop to right field. He has a quick release on his throws and can record 1.9-second pop times to second base.A PERSON recruit, PERSON still requires some offensive and defensive polish. He needs to temper his approach at the plate because he doesn't always make consistent contact against quality pitching. He has improved as a receiver but still has more work to do and loses concentration more often than he should.",0
"PERSON flashed top-two-rounds stuff as a sophomore and again during fall practice, but he missed six weeks after straining an oblique in early March. PERSON has plagued him during his college career and again since his return, though he helped his ORGANIZATION stock by pitching better toward season's end. He's likely to become PERSON' earliest pick since the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in 2003's second round.When he's at his best, PERSON can display three plus pitches, starting with a 92-94 mph fastball that reaches 97 mph and features some run and sink. Hitters have a difficult time laying off his low-80s slider, giving him a second swing-and-miss pitch. There are times when his changeup is his most effective secondary offering, sitting in the low 80s with similar action to his heater.For all his stuff, PERSON has little track record of success or throwing strikes. His inability to get ahead in the count and locate his pitches makes him more hittable than he should be. He has some effort in his delivery and doesn't always repeat it well, so he could wind up as a reliever.",0
"The nephew of former big leaguer PERSON, PERSON went to PERSON as a middle infielder and left as a catcher. Signed for a below-slot $95,000 as a ninth-round pick by the Marlins in 2011, he played extensively at catcher and second base before going to the ORGANIZATION in the seven-player PERSON trade in December 2014. PERSON earned Triple-A PERSON all-star honors and made his big league debut in his first season with his new organization.Though he doesn't get a lot of prospect hype because he's already 26 and he has PERSON and A.J. Ellis in front of him in GPE, PERSON has the tools to be a first-string catcher. A right-handed hitter, he excels at controlling the strike zone and consistently provides high batting averages and on-base percentages. He mostly concentrates on hitting line drives and using the middle of the field, but he also has some sneaky power and could hit 12-15 homers per year.A gifted receiver who moves well behind the plate and has an average arm, PERSON is a bit underrated as a defender because he has spent a lot of time elsewhere on the diamond. He played second and third base during his September callup and could be an extremely valuable utilityman if he can't crack the starting lineup.",0
"GPE has lots of natural loft in his swing and his frame has significant projection so there's a chacne he grows into huge raw power. He's likely to move to a corner outfield spot and here are questions about how much he's going to hit because of how overmatched he looked at times last summer against elite pitching, but he's hitting more this spring. ",0
"Pro teams have been waiting to get their hands on PERSON's live arm since he hit 98 mph as a freshman at LOCATION. They've also spent three years trying to figure him out, because his results haven't matched his upside. He was winless through his first 10 starts this spring, dropping his college record to 6-16.PERSON touched 98 mph again as a reliever in the ORGANIZATION last summer, but he has spent most of 2014 working at 89-93. His slider has regressed as well after showing potential as a plus pitch in the past. His feel for his changeup is erratic, as is his control and command.At his best, PERSON can display two above-average pitches and a solid third offering. Because he doesn't do so with consistency, he could wind up in the bullpen as a pro. His brother PERSON, a right-hander at GPE (Ill.) JC, also should be drafted in June.",0
"Several freak injuries upended ORGANIZATION's 2018. He missed most of May battling vertigo symptoms for the second time in nine months (they first started in late August '17), then fractured a finger in late-June and missed the rest of the season. He was supposed to play in the ORGANIZATION, but a return of the left elbow pain he had played through during the year became severe enough that he needed an ORGANIZATION, which revealed bone spurs. He had surgery and was shut down for the year. When ORGANIZATION did play, he was very good and slashed .310/.378/.509 in 44 games at Triple-A while playing second base for the first time in affiliated ball. ORGANIZATION's likely future defensive home is still to be determined. He wasn't a very good defensive third baseman early in college but became one as a junior. The presence of PERSON led to reps at second base, and PERSON's emergence led to what was supposed to be reps in left and center field this fall before ORGANIZATION needed surgery. The departure of PERSON leaves an obvious hole that he could potentially fill, but he hasn't been seen playing center enough to know for sure. At the very least, he has stumbled into defensive versatility. Mostly though, ORGANIZATION hits. He doesnât have monster raw power, nor does he seek to take max-effort swings by utilizing a big stride or leg kick. Instead, his power comes from precise, high-quality contact. Heâs going to be a doubles machine with home runs coming opportunistically rather than playing core aspect of his approach, but heâll still hit for power. He has the skills and polish of a near-ready star, and the injuries don't seem like they're going to be a chronic thing. ",1
"An 18th-round pick in 1991, PERSON overcame those humble Draft roots to win three ORGANIZATION, make an All-Star team and hit four homers in a big league game. His son won't have to wait nearly as long to hear his name called in 2015.One of just three players ever selected to play in two Under PERSON All-America Games, PERSON emerged as a potential No. 1 overall pick as a sophomore. While his upside has leveled off a bit since then, he still profiles as a center fielder who could have at least solid tools across the board. In addition to his physical ability, he shows fine instincts in all phases of the game.PERSON should have at least average big league power, but he doesn't worry about home runs at this point. The ORGANIZATION State recruit laces line drives all over the field with a short right-handed swing and plenty of bat speed. While he's not a blazer, he can steal a few bases and chases down balls in the gaps.",0
"PERSON burst onto the scouting scene in 2018 at FACILITY in GPE after bouncing back from PERSON. Some teams were hesitant to take him where his talent suggested (second or third round) due to their interpretation of what led to him to leave PERSON, but the ORGANIZATION were excited to give him an over slot bonus in the fifth round of a draft where they were missing a third round selection. PERSON's stuff is exciting -- up to 97 mph, with a slider that flashes plus, and a solid average curve and changeup that flashed average -- while his arm action, athleticism, and command give him a chance to start, despite a short track record of doing so. Regardless, his present stuff will play in any role and fits where the game is going, so simply staying healthy, getting innings, and maintaining his stuff should keep him on the prospect radar.",0
"A year ago, PERSON looked like perhaps the best college bat in the ORGANIZATION region for the 2018 GPE, but in May of 2017, a collision with the outfield wall resulted in a serious hip injury that required surgery. He returned in time to play all of his junior year, though his speed was initially hampered. Other college hitters in the area may have passed him, but he was coming on strong as the GPE approached.PERSON has excellent bat to ball skills and makes consistent hard contact. It's more of a line drive approach at present, though the left-handed hitter has some extra-base thump. While he might run into a few homers along the way, he's definitely an average over power kind of hitter. Before the injury, PERSON's athleticism and speed were by far his best tool, with some putting a 70 on his run tool. It's more of a 60 now, though it's trending upward the further removed from surgery he becomes. He's a solid defender in center field with a decent arm.The more PERSON looks like his pre-injury self, the more his name was moving up boards, with some buzz as early as the third round. PERSON thinking about taking him will have to put aside any worries about long-range questions about his health.",0
"PERSON pitched for ORGANIZATION's (Fla.) high school squad as a senior before going to the ORGANIZATION in the eighth round of the 2015 Draft and signing for $725,000. He already has been traded twice, getting dealt to the ORGANIZATION in a package for PERSON in November 2015 and going to the Indians in the three-team swap that sent PERSON to the Reds this July. The Double-A PERSON of the Year in 2018, he made his big league debut this June but has struggled this year in Triple-A and the Majors. After pitching with a below-average fastball at the outset of his career, PERSON now operates more in the 92-94 mph range with late life. He's aggressive with his fastball placement and confidently attacks right-handed hitters on the inner half of the plate. A changeup that receives plus grades and plays nicely off his heater is his best secondary offering, and he also has feel for throwing his curveball and slider for strikes, with the latter grading as the better pitch.PERSON battled elbow issues during his first full pro season but has been healthy since. His four-pitch mix and pitchability give him a higher floor than ceiling, and he has the durability needed to be a workhorse starter in the big leagues.",1
"It's a good year for high school pitching in GPE, particularly left-handers. PERSON may not be on the same level as top-of-the-Draft possibility PERSON, but he's a legitimate top three round candidate based on his talent.Scouts had to wait for the weather to improve in the FACILITY in order to see the 6-foot-3 southpaw, but once his season began, PERSON did not disappoint. He's been up to 93 mph consistently with his fastball and commands it fairly well. His best secondary offering is his changeup. He has a very good feel for it and it should be a plus offspeed offering for him in the future. His breaking ball, a slider, is below-average, but given his overall feel for pitching, he should be able to develop a consistent breaking ball down the road.The biggest question mark surrounding PERSON might be his signability. He has a strong commitment to GPE and he might have to go fairly early to keep him from heading to GPE for school.",0
"This Indiana State left-hander had one of the best summers of any amateur, lighting up the ORGANIZATION League.He's not as polished as, say, PERSON or even PERSON, but a southpaw who was up to 96 mph on the ORGANIZATION is going to get a lot of attention.He complements the plus fastball with a hard slurve that's very effective. He doesn't have as good a feel for pitching as the top two college arms on this list, but a 6-foot-5 lefty with that kind of arm strength had many flocking to the GPE in 2013.Manaea earned two awards for his efforts on the ORGANIZATION -- he went 5-1 with a 1.22 ERA, striking out 85 in just 51 2/3 innings of work -- getting the league's top pitching honor as well as being named the outstanding pro prospect for the elite college summer league.",1
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $350,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in April 2013, but he didn't make his pro debut until June 2014 because he drew a 50-game suspension after testing positive for an anabolic steroid. He spent his first two seasons as a starter before becoming a full-time reliever in 2016, when he reached PERSON and opened some eyes by hitting 100 mph with his fastball.PERSON's stuff took a step forward when he moved to the bullpen. His fastball, which sat around 90 mph when he signed and 92-94 mph when he started, worked at 94-97 with some sinking and running action when he relieved. His slider surged as well, sitting in the mid 80s with sharper bite than in the past.PERSON also has a changeup that's fringy at best, but he doesn't really need it in his new role. While he made some progress with his control and command, both require further refinement. He's a long way from the big leagues, but his fastball will afford him plenty of time to get there.",1
"Two consecutive seasons lost to a combination of PERSON rehab and mononucleosis highlight a robust, early-career injury history for PERSON, who has been encouragingly healthy for the last two years. He works at the top of the zone with a low-90s fastball, and beneath it with a big, breaking 12-to-6 curveball used against left and right-handed hitters, and he bisects the plate horizontally with a cutter/slider and changeup. A 6% walk rate in 2018 was comfortably PERSON's career best, which may be real development or just something that will regress to PERSON's career mean. It's ORGANIZATION. 4 or 5 starter stuff from an arm whose injury history, which one could argue should soon be expunged, moves him toward the back of that FV group. He's at ORGANIZATION and may see the big leagues this year.",1
"PERSON's power output ticked up when he was a junior at ORGANIZATION, and he finished with a dozen homers and a .518 slugging percentage. The fact that he does it from the left side of the plate, and perhaps has the chance to catch, made him an intriguing 11th-round pick by the ORGANIZATION last June. He then slugged his way from the GPE League to the LOCATION during his pro debut, hitting another 13 balls out of the park. He couldn't quite replicate those results in his first full year, though he did reach double digits in home runs back in the ORGANIZATION in 2018.It will be PERSON's bat that will allow him to continue to move up the ORGANIZATION' ladder. The power is legitimate, with it perhaps coming more from strength than bat speed, but he did show in his debut that he can hit the ball out to both his pull side and the opposite field, going to left-center field with ease. With the power comes considerable swing and miss, but PERSON mitigates that, at times, with a willingness to take walks.While he played several positions at ORGANIZATION and saw time at first and third during his debut, PERSON committed himself to catching only for the time being. He has work to do on his receiving and he'll have to quicken his release to use his arm strength better, but the ORGANIZATION like the strides he's made and the work he's put in to improving defensively, with the hopes of finding a power-hitting backup.",0
"PERSON benefitted from a big draft spring for ORGANIZATION, jumping from two campaigns with a .700-something ORGANIZATION to a 1.023 ORGANIZATION and 33 extra base hits in 58 games. The upside here still isn't huge, with all five tools right around average, but PERSON has the feel to hit and defend such that he could be a good platoon outfielder who can play all three spots and get a bulk of the at-bats. The realistic outcome if the bat plays and the 22-year-old moves relatively quickly through the minors is a 450 plate appearance outfielder with fringy offense who plays above average corner defense.",0
"Arguably the best pitcher available in the 2012 Draft, GPE rarely has been healthy since signing for $3 million as the ORGANIZATION. 5 overall pick. The ORGANIZATION expected him to reach the big leagues within two years, but elbow, biceps, lat and shoulder injuries restricted him to 222 1/3 innings in his first five pro seasons. He worked just 5 2/3 in 2016 before undergoing thoracic outlet surgery that left PERSON guardedly optimistic about his future.Before he got hurt, GPE could showcase frontline-starter stuff with a 92-97 mph fastball that reached triple digits, a hammer curveball and flashes of a solid slider and changeup. In 2017, he has pitched more at 91-94 mph with his heater and his breaking pitches have yet to regain their former power as well. He opened the year as a starter but came down with shoulder soreness after three outings, and he headed to the bullpen after spending another two months on the disabled list.Originally recruited by the ORGANIZATION of GPE as a third baseman, GPE is a fine athlete who has no trouble repeating his mechanics and delivering strikes. If he has to remain a reliever, he could offer closer upside if he regains his former stuff. His younger brother PERSON was also a first-round pick (2014, GPE) and made his big league debut in 2017.",0
"PERSON' velocity and prospect status took off in 2014, when he reclassified from a high school junior to a Draft-eligible senior, yet he turned down early-round overtures from clubs in order to attend PERSON. Many scouts believed his fastball and slider were the best combination of pitches in the 2017 Draft, where he went 15th overall and signed for $3.6 million. An automobile accident in his first Spring Training left him with a slipped disc and limited him to three appearances in the first three months of the 2018 season, but his overpowering stuff was apparent down the stretch and in the ORGANIZATION. He was having an inconsistent season in Double-A, albeit while missing plenty of bats, when the ORGANIZATION packaged him with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON to GPE to get PERSON at the 2019 PERSON' best offering is his slider, which combines mid-80s power with late, sharp bite, though he can fall in love with it and lose some feel for his fastball. His heater is also formidable, sitting in the mid-90s, topping out at 98 mph and featuring some sink and run. He flashed a plus changeup with fade in the ORGANIZATION, though he needs to throw it more often to improve its consistency, and he also can mix in a cutter.The debate over whether PERSON is better suited to be a starter or reliever dates to his high school days. He has settled down his delivery somewhat since then but still throws with effort, and his lack of size and reliable command could point him toward the bullpen. He could move very fast in a relief role, though others see him as a ORGANIZATION type.",0
"GPE spurts in teenagers certainly isn't uncommon. PERSON had one at an opportune time, growing a couple of inches heading into his senior year at PERSON in GPE. His stuff all ticked up as a result, with teams heading to GPE as the weather warmed to see just how much he had improved.PERSON has been up to 96 mph with his fastball, sitting in the 92-93 mph range deep into starts. He has good feel for an average changeup. His breaking ball is slurvy right now, but he has a feel to spin it and he can land it for strikes, with scouts feeling it will likely work better as a slider. PERSON has an extremely quick arm that should work going forward. His command should be average at the next level.PERSON's stock took a hit when he didn't throw as well as he had in front of decision-makers, but those who have seen him all spring will likely be pounding the table for him at the appropriate time. As a late bloomer, he is committed to ORGANIZATION, and he could be signed away from that by being taken in the first few rounds.",0
"The PERSON backed out of a $2.5 million agreement with PERSON after he tested positive for ORGANIZATION as an amateur.  He eventually came to a $1.5 million deal with PERSON, which was reduced to $1.2 million after his physical. While there's creeping doubt about his ability to stay at shortstop -- some scouts have gone so far as to say he appears wholly disinterested in defense -- there's confidence in PERSON doing well-rounded damage on offense. He's an athletic swinger with plus bat speed and bat control, and is especially adept at impacting pitches in the bottom of the strike zone. 
For now, PERSON's approach is rather hedonistic, and he's talented enough to make that work, at least for a while. Though this feature adds some approach-related risk to his profile, there's huge ceiling if PERSON remedies his defensive shortcomings and becomes more selective, and is probably a strong everyday role if just one of those things happens.",0
"While the island of GPE made big Draft headlines in 2012 with the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick (the ORGANIZATION' PERSON) and the ORGANIZATION. 32 overall pick (the ORGANIZATION' PERSON), PERSON was the top PERSON in the Class of 2011 and has a chance to join PERSON and PERSON as impactful big leaguers soon, even if it takes him a bit longer to fully develop.The 2014 PERSON has the chance to have a very good three-pitch mix. Tall and projectable, he could add to his low-90s heavy fastball that already generates a ton of groundball outs. He knows how to spin a breaking ball, throwing a solid curve with good rotation and bite. His changeup has improved, though it remains behind the other two offerings. His command has improved and he's shown a good overall feel for pitching.PERSON showed tremendous mental toughness pitching through the 2014 season while his young son was very ill. That, along with the strides he has made since being drafted, has the ORGANIZATION confident he can be a starting pitcher at the big league level.",1
"PERSON started for three years at ORGANIZATION, even hitting in the middle of the lineup there at times as a junior, before landing with the ORGANIZATION in the sixth round of the 2016 GPE. He turned in a GPE York-Penn League All-Star season during his pro debut and played across three levels, reaching Double-A in his first full season.While PERSON played both middle infield positions during his first summer of pro ball, he has exclusively played short, a big reason why he's been able to rush up the organizational ladder. He's a solid defender with excellent hands, solid range and enough arm for the left side of the infield. While he's not a burner, his speed is an asset defensively and on the basepaths. He's a switch-hitter with a contact-oriented approach, one who draws walks and doesn't strike out much.PERSON probably profiles best as a utilityman when all is said and done. Seeing him as a defensive-minded regular isn't out of the question, especially given the ORGANIZATION' ability to find big league talent in college performers taken in the later rounds of the GPE.",1
"The ORGANIZATION landed two of the most polished pitchers in the 2015 PERSON, pairing collegian PERSON in the first round with PERSON in the third. The latter is a product of GPE's PERSON, which has produced five first-rounders and four big leaguers in the last two decades, highlighted by PERSON. He's also the son of GPE vice president of amateur and international scouting PERSON PERSON.Signed for $950,000, PERSON also had one of the best curveballs in last year's PERSON, a true downer that he'll throw in any count. His fastball usually operates at 89-93 but still gets swings and misses because it sinks and tails and he hides and locates it well.PERSON grew up around baseball and played at one of the top high school programs in the nation, so he's more advanced than most pitchers his age. He has good feel for his changeup, which has improved since he entered pro ball, and commands his stuff well. He's a high-floor pitcher with a ceiling of a mid-rotation starter.",0
" While PERSON has hit pretty much everywhere the ORGANIZATION have sent him since drafting him in the third round in 2010, he scuffled upon reaching Triple-A in 2015. He still made his big league debut in GPE, and a shoulder injury forced him out of action for over a month.A compact swing and quick hands allow PERSON to make consistent hard contact. He can occasionally turn on a ball and drives the gaps well, but power is not a big part of his game. He knows how to take advantage of his plus speed and can be disruptive on the basepaths. He has made significant strides on the defensive side of the ball as a professional and profiles well at second base. PERSON endears himself to scouts with his hustle and hard-nosed style of play. Though his height makes it easy to label him a grinder, his tools give him a good chance to be a solid regular in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"GPE had solid average stuff most of his career at ORGANIZATION, but some scouts thought his velocity would improve, which it did in the last month or so, allowing him to project as a 3rd/4th starter.",0
"A four-year starter at GPE, PERSON helped the Gators reach the ORGANIZATION World Series in 2012 and '15. The leading hitter (.355) on the latter ORGANIZATION club, which may produce as many as seven position players drafted in the top three rounds, PERSON signed with the Phillies for $10,000 as a 10th-round senior. He batted .301/.362/.439 in his first two pro seasons, reaching high Class A, before GSP traded him for PERSON in December.PERSON' strong suit is his ability to make consistent line-drive contact. A switch-hitter who's more effective from his natural right side, he can drive some balls to the gaps and has occasional home run power to his pull side. While he doesn't strike out excessively, he would benefit from a more patient approach to bolster his walk totals.Primarily a third baseman in college, PERSON has played mostly second base as a pro. An average runner with arm strength to match, he doesn't quite have the quickness desired at the keystone and is a fringy defender there. He also has seen action in left field and profiles best as a bat-first utility guy who earns raves for his makeup.",0
" There is no question that PERSON is ready to defend behind the plate at the big league level. That was apparent even before he got his first callup, a trip cut very short in his first game by an ankle sprain (he made it back up in September). PERSON has thrown out 46 percent of would-be basestealers in the Minors with above-average arm strength that plays up as plus thanks to a quick release and excellent accuracy. He's made strides with the bat as well â he hit very well post-injury in 2012 â and could be a fringy hitter. With his glove work, that should be enough to land him a big league job of some sort, though there isn't room behind the plate in GPE right now.",1
"PERSON's 2018 was his first injury-free full season as a pro, but he was used out of the bullpen in health-friendly two and three-inning stints separated by several days of rest. He was also crushed underneath a landslide .443 BABIP and had a 7.28 ERA at Double-A. 
He has back-end starter stuff but was part of the ORGANIZATION lefty bullpen competition during the spring. During that time, PERSON worked in the 91-94 range; he can spot cutting and breaking stuff to his glove side, and his changeup is suitable for light usage versus righties. We still like him as a No. 4 or 5 starter type, though we could see justifying a bullpen move if the ORGANIZATION thought it was why PERSON stayed healthy all last year. He seems likely to be a competent part of a pitching staff in some form, and had a good showing with the 2019 big club during spring training before being sent back to Double-A in late-March.",1
"PERSON was one of four prep hitters in the 2018 class -- along with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON -- who played together in the ORGANIZATION USA pipeline for years; all got top-two round money in the draft. PERSON is the best of the group because he offers the best contact skills while also being tied for having the most raw power, speed, and defensive value. His well-rounded skillset enticed the ORGANIZATION to take him sixth overall, but he was then traded by new GM PERSON as the headliner to acquire PERSON and PERSON. PERSON is an intense competitor who works tirelessly, to the point that some teammates and scouts think he should reel it back in a bit at times, though they point out they'd rather have a guy who's too dedicated than one who's not enough. He's a plus straight-line runner but more of a 55 on the field, and thus isn't a slam dunk to stick in center. But he has 55 raw power, so there's enough thump to profile if he ends up sliding over to right field, where his plus arm would also fit.",0
"From GPE, GPE, PERSON is arguable the top player from his country in this year's class. The teenager has shown the ability to hit, but he has impressed scouts the most with his defensive skills. He looks the part, scouts say, because he calls a good game and takes control behind the plate.How good is PERSON? Some evaluators believe he has a potential plus arm and could be a plus defender in the future. They also like his solid receiving skills, a must for any good catcher. Other scouts consider his arm average, but they also note that it's impossible to ignore the total package and his overall potential.PERSON signed a $1 million deal with the GPE.",0
"In many respects, PERSON is already a huge success story. He went undrafted and lightly recruited out of high school, making PERSON as a preferred walk-on. He was a three-year, and much honored, starter there and was the second-highest pick in the program's history when the A's took him in the third round of the 2016 Draft, a spot he fell to because of a broken left hamate during his final collegiate season. He's turned into one of the better all-around catching prospects in the game, excelling in Double-A in 2018, though surgery on his other hamate in July shelved him for seven weeks. He was off to a strong start in Triple-A in 2019 when he once again hit the injured list, this time with a torn left meniscus that required surgery in early May. PERSON has always stood out defensively. He's athletic and agile behind the plate, he blocks and receives well and gets high marks for his game-calling and ability to work with pitchers. He also has one of the strongest arms in the Minors, one that baserunners don't test too often and that has thrown out 35.5 percent of potential basestealers heading into 2019. He's a threat at the plate as well, with a short swing from the right side of the plate to go with a high contact rate. He's not afraid to draw walks and there could be 20-homer potential in the future.PERSON will be a big leaguer based on his glovework alone, one who could be a defensive-minded starter. Add in his possible offensive production and he has the chance to be an elite-level, all-around receiver soon.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 14, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON has deep baseball roots, as his father, GPE, played professional ball for five seasons in the early '90s and made it to high A Ball with the ORGANIZATION and PERSON Rangers.With his father as a mentor, the LOCATION commit has earned praise from scouts and was named a 2016 Perfect Game All-American, where he was the starting catcher for the GPE team.Scouts see PERSON as a solid catching prospect, both offensively and defensively. With a pop time ranging from 1.7-1.9 seconds, he boasts the ability for his arm to accelerate and throw quickly to the base. At the plate, he handles the bat really well, making good contact to all fields with power.",0
"PERSON was the top-rated pitcher on MLB.com's Top 30 international prospects list in 2013 and the ORGANIZATION gave him $1.3 million to sign in July of that year. After making his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION last summer, PERSON was sent to the ORGANIZATION in January as part of the ORGANIZATION trade.PERSON is not the biggest guy in the world, but he has the makings of a very good three-pitch mix with the chance to command it fairly well. His fastball right now will sit in the low-90s, but he can reach back for more. While only six-feet tall, there is some room for him to add strength to his frame and that could lead to additional velocity. PERSON will show a solid curve and some pretty good feel for a changeup, though none of it consistently at this point. His delivery needs some work and that should help him command the baseball better.It may take a while, but PERSON is the kind of young arm who will prove to be the best return in a trade years after the deal was made.",0
"The younger brother of PERSON, who pitched in one game for the 2010 Tigers, PERSON concluded his amateur career by winning ORGANIZATION honors at the 2015 College World Series. After earning three victories and a save while throwing 13 scoreless innings in relief for GPE, he signed for $722,500 as a supplemental second-round pick and reached high Class A in his pro debut. He returned there in 2016 and has been one of the GPE's best starting pitchers.A reliever as a freshman and junior for the ORGANIZATION, PERSON focused on two pitches when he came out of the bullpen. Neither his 91-95 mph fastball nor his slider is overpowering, but they both feature late life that keeps them off the barrels of bats. When he needed a third offering as a sophomore starter, he did exhibit some feel for a changeup but the pitch needs a lot of work.The Dodgers plan on using PERSON in the rotation. His unorthodox arm action adds to his deception but hampers his control and command, and he's working on getting more consistent with the front side of his delivery to help him locate his pitches better. He has a durable frame and the upside of a mid-rotation starter if he can make the necessary adjustments, and he also could advance quickly if he returns to the bullpen.",0
"It's not a good class for college catching, so one who performs well is bound to move up PERSON boards.The switch-hitting PERSON has had to wait his time to get behind the plate, playing first and the outfield for his first two years at ORGANIZATION. He has a lot of work to do defensively behind the plate, though he does have a solid arm. He is showing, as he has with some very strong summer ball performances, that he can hit. PERSON has the chance to hit for average and power.The team that feels his defense will improve with more time behind the plate and some patience, will likely take him early in the hopes he can be a solid offensive-minded backstop.",0
"If a post-Draft physical hadn't revealed a bone chip in his elbow, PERSON would have signed with the ORGANIZATION for $80,000 as a 23rd-rounder out of high school in 2010. Instead he spent a year each at two different GPE junior colleges before turning pro as a fourth-rounder in 2012. He'd moved slowly and steadily up the ORGANIZATION' ladder, reaching Triple-A in 2015, when he was included in the group of prospects the ORGANIZATION received in return for PERSON Hamels.PERSON can reach 96 mph with his fastball and back it up with a hard slider at his best, but his stuff dipped somewhat in 2014. He worked mostly at 89-93 mph with an average slider. His changeup remained a reliable third pitch and he continued to use a curveball to give hitters a different look. PERSON employs an easy delivery that results in very solid control and command. He lacks a true plus pitch but has consistently performed and could end up as an innings-eating mid-rotation starter.",1
"Trenta-sized teenagers who throw in the mid-90s don't typically have any idea where its going, but PERSON threw strikes so efficiently for two months in the ORGANIZATION that the ORGANIZATION thought him fit for an August promotion. He made his stateside debut just before his 17th birthday and walked just six hitters in 50 innings all summer. So PERSON has rare size, precocious velocity, and control, though much of the rest of the profile has room for improvement. He exhibits neither notable raw spin nor feel for locating his current breaking ball,  a low-80s slurve. There's a strong chance PERSON tries several iterations of various breaking balls during the course of his development and the one(s) he ends up with will probably look much different than what he's currently using. At this point in his development, we just care about the raw spin, a trait of limited malleability, and PERSON' is just okay. It's reasonable to hope he grows into elite velocity. The fact that he's throwing this hard at this age and at this size is encouraging, though he's less projectable than one would probably assume given his age and height. All talk of PERSON' physical progression centers around reshaping his current frame rather than just adding mass, as he's already pretty filled out. This clouds the fastball projection somewhat, but he'll probably still end up throwing really hard. There's need for significant development throughout the rest of the repertoire, and it's more likely that a portion of that happens (resulting in a back-of-the rotation or bullpen role) than it is that all of it does (resulting in stardom). He signed for $250,000 in 2017.",0
"GPE is a one-seam sinker/changeup righty with a pretty firm, inconsistent mid-80s slider. A refined slider gives him a good shot to pitch in the back of a rotation.",0
"Pitching out of the bullpen during his three years at ORGANIZATION, PERSON compiled 22 career saves while appearing in 62 games before going to the ORGANIZATION in the 11th round in the 2015 Draft. His stuff has improved since entering the professional ranks, enabling the right-hander to make a quick rise through the ORGANIZATION. After a dominant performance with Double-A Montgomery in his second full season, PERSON opened 2018 on the cusp of the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION, where he was a mid-season All-Star with PERSON. One of many hard-throwing relievers in the upper tiers of PERSON's system, PERSON attacks hitters with a mid-90s fastball that consistently reaches 97 mph with late life. He throws a pair of quality secondary pitches in a power slider that's been up to 90 mph with late diving action, and a changeup that at times plays above its plus grade. The three-pitch mix makes PERSON effective against right- and left-handed hitters alike, and he's long showed the ability to keep the ball in the park. Big and physical with a track record of durability, PERSON could soon carve out a role as a high-leverage reliever in the big leagues. His control and command still leaves something to be desired, especially as it relates to his slider, though he did show improvement on that front early in his first Triple-A campaign.",0
"A reliever on ORGANIZATION teams that won the ORGANIZATION World Series in 2014 and finished runner-up in 2015, PERSON opened 2016 in the ORGANIZATION rotation before returning to the bullpen and serving as closer. After signing him for an above-slot $1.6 million as a second-rounder, the ORGANIZATION sent him to low Class A, where he led the LOCATION League with 11 holds in 26 appearances. He has yet to pitch in 2017 while dealing with a bulging disc in his back that may require surgery.Pitching in shorter stints, PERSON operates at 92-95 mph with his fastball, which tops out at 97 and features late life and steep downhill plane. Though he only pitched 96 1/3 innings in three years of college, he has impressive feel for a tumbling changeup that can be a plus offering at times. He has some power to a slurvy breaking ball that fluctuates between a curveball and slider and shows more promise as the latter.While some scouts believe PERSON could make it as a starter with three pitches and a durable frame, GPE will keep him in the bullpen and expedite him to the big leagues. He could be one of the first players from the 2016 Draft to reach the Majors, though his back issues have slowed his timetable. More than just a lefty specialist, he's equipped to become a set-up man and could turn into a closer if he improves his slider and command.",0
"After having five right-handers selected in the top five rounds of the last four GPE, PERSON has two more candidates this year in relievers PERSON and PERSON. The ORGANIZATION' career saves leader with 26 entering ORGANIZATION tournament play, PERSON might be able to make the transition to starting in pro ball.PERSON has a quick arm that consistently produces 93-95 mph fastballs with heavy sink that he can command to either side of the plate. He usually throws his low-80s slider for strikes and can turn it into more of a cutter, though it also gets slurvy at times. He shows some feel for a changeup but doesn't need it much in a relief role.PERSON has a strong, durable frame and three pitches, so a team could be tempted to try him in the rotation. He doesn't have a classic starter's delivery, but he does repeat it well. If he stays in the bullpen, he could become a seventh-inning reliever and perhaps more if he can refine his slider.",0
"Teammate of PERSON and PERSON has emerged to be another top-5 round talent at PERSON. PERSON was eligible last year but has emerged this year, sitting 94-98 and hitting 100 mph. He also DH'd for PERSON and has some raw power.",0
"Originally a 30th-round pick by the ORGANIZATION in 2013, PERSON opted not to sign and instead honored his commitment to GPE, where he pitched for one season before transferring to PERSON and sitting out for all of '15. Selected by the Nationals in the 22nd round the following year, PERSON has rewarded the organization by making steady progress in each pro season and reached Double-A for the first time in June 2018. A two-sport standout who excelled on both the hardwood and diamond as a prep, PERSON stands out on the mound for his blend of athleticism, stuff and remaining projection. The 6-foot-4 right-hander pitches with a low-90s fastball that features exceptional sink and nets him a plethora of weak, ground-ball outs. PERSON pairs his heater with a quality changeup, giving him two above-average offerings, and the Nationals have been pleased with his development of a slider. PERSON possesses average control and command because he repeats his delivery and arm action well. That feel for pounding the zone allows for PERSON's three-pitch mix to play up, and he's long proved adept at keeping the ball in the park. While he remains a work-in-progress overall, PERSON's impressive development and remaining projection has led some evaluators to peg him as a future back-end starter at the highest level.",0
"PERSON lost most of 2015 and 2016 at ORGANIZATION after a line drive to the head left him with severe concussion symptoms, then bounced back to become the second pitcher in school history with a 100-strikeout season as a redshirt senior in 2018. The ORGANIZATION offered him a $5,000 bonus as a 32nd-round pick and he has made the most of that opportunity. He began this year in extended spring training but earned a promotion from low Class A reliever to high Class A starter in GPE, and he didn't permit an earned run in his first four starts afterward.PERSON's success hinges on a sinker that rivals PERSON's as the best in the system. He has sat at 92-93 mph and touched 95 with his two-seamer as a starter, and Class A hitters have struggled to lift it in the air. He throws his curveball and slider in the low 80s, and they're reliably average offerings when they don't blend together.He has some feel for a changeup as well, enhancing PERSON's chances of remaining a starter and becoming a back-of-the-rotation option. To do so, he'll have to upgrade his control and command. He lacks a wipeout offering but his sinker gives him a chance to join PERSON as the only ORGANIZATION products to reach the Majors.",0
"PERSON High in GPE has produced four first-round picks in the last two decades: PERSON (1995), PERSON (2000), PERSON (2000) and PERSON (2002). PERSON, PERSON's latest star, might get picked earlier than any of them because he's an offensively gifted catcher with plus arm strength to boot. His standout tool is his right-handed power, which he generates with bat speed and strength. He has enough feel for hitting that he could produce .280 batting averages in the ORGANIZATION. To do that, he'll need to curb a tendency for his swing that gets long at times which causes him to miss hittable fastballs. PERSON's arm gives him a third future plus tool. He moves better than most catchers, though his receiving will need to improve if he's to stick behind the plate. If not, he has enough athleticism and bat to make it as a right fielder. He has committed to GPE.",1
"The trade that sent ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION has already paid the ORGANIZATION a huge dividend in the form of PERSON and, to a lesser extent, GPE d'Arnaud. If PERSON's transition to full-season ball in 2015 is any indication, there could be more payment on the way.PERSON, who received a seven-figure bonus from the ORGANIZATION when he signed in 2011 out of GPE, more than held his own at age 20 in the LOCATION. That he did so in GPE, one of the worst hitting environments in the ORGANIZATION, was even more impressive. PERSON showed some of his raw power in the first half, but he expanded his strike zone too much. To his credit, he adjusted, and his walk rate skyrocketed while his strikeout rate came down. PERSON has plus power potential, and his improved hittability could allow him to tap into it more consistently in the future. PERSON is an average runner with an arm a tick above average, with enough of each to play a capable right field. If the bat continues to click, he should have the kind of offensive profile teams want from the corner outfield position.",0
"Could PERSON be the next Alcides Escobar? Some evaluators sure think so.Known for his quick and soft hands with good range to both sides, there's a lot scouts like about PERSON' game, including the way he turns double plays. PERSON also praise his overall defensive actions and athleticism. What's more, PERSON has a strong enough arm to keep him at shortstop in the future, but it's not unreasonable to think he changes positions in the future because of his overall skill set.On offense, PERSON shows a balanced approach at the plate, good bat speed and a slight uppercut in his swing. He's a line-drive hitter who makes hard contact and is able to spray the ball to all fields.PERSON projects to be an average runner in the future and is usually clocked between 7 to 7.1 seconds in the 60-yard run. He's also expected to hit for more power as he grows physically.The infielder from GPE, GPE, trains with PERSON and is represented by PERSON of ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION Sox are the favorite to sign him.",0
"A Cape Cod League All-Star in 2015, PERSON continued to improve his ORGANIZATION stock the next year while helping PERSON advance to the ORGANIZATION II Championship Tournament. One of 10 finalists for the PERSON, presented annually to the nation's top ORGANIZATION II hurler, PERSON became the highest ORGANIZATION pick in GPE history when the ORGANIZATION selected him in the sixth round. Though he would garner ORGANIZATION All-Star honors in his full-season debut, PERSON's time with the ORGANIZATION came to an end in July when he was traded to GPE, along with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, in the deal for PERSON. PERSON sits in the low 90s with his fastball, touching 93 mph, but it plays up, thanks to a high spin rate, and because he locates it to all quadrants of the zone. His slider is a plus offering, thrown with short, late biting action that misses bats, and he also shows feel for mixing in a curveball and a changeup, though both are currently fringy. PERSON's strike-throwing ability is another strength. He walked just 13 batters in 107 2/3 innings as a junior, and then posted a 51-to-7 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 56 innings during his pro debut in the LOCATION League.PERSON has a clean arm action and repeats his delivery with ease, but a general lack of movement on his pitches has led some to project him in a long-relief role. The ORGANIZATION were more optimistic, believing that PERSON can develop into a solid back-of-the-rotation starter, and he certainly looked the part this season during his time in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON started at shortstop for three years at ORGANIZATION. For the first two, he was known mostly for his ability with the glove. A big step forward with the bat as a junior allowed him to be thought of as one of the best all-around prospects at the position and landed him in the fifth round, where he signed with the ORGANIZATION for nearly $100,000 below pick value.While PERSON lacks a plus tool, he does have the chance to hit and stay at short, which puts him ahead of many of his college counterparts. He's an average runner with a solid arm and gets the job done at the premium position without any flash, relying on good anticipation and a quick first step. He has fast hands and can make throws from a variety of angles. While he might be a bottom-of-the-order hitter at the highest level, he does make consistent contact and started driving the ball with more authority than he used to during his junior season. He's not a plus runner, but he does have excellent baserunning instincts.PERSON may not wow anyone with tools, but he's the kind of solid performer who ends up as an everyday shortstop on a winning PERSON roster.",0
"After drafting PERSON O'Neill out of GPE Columbia in 2013, the ORGANIZATION turned to the GPE prep ranks for power once again in '14, selecting ORGANIZATION native GPE with the ORGANIZATION. 74 overall pick and then signing him with a well-above-slot $2 million bonus. But unlike O'Neill, who has emerged as a Top 100 overall prospect, GPE played in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION for a third straight season. A physical specimen at 6-foot-4, 220 pounds, GPE has robust raw power and a ton of bat speed from the right side of the plate. So far, though, he has yet to neither apply his power nor make contact with any semblance of consistency. In his return to the ORGANIZATION last year, his feast or famine approach resulted in a league-worst strikeout total and strikeout rate, and it's difficult to envision him making strides in that regard until he improves his pitch recognition and overall approach. Defensively, GPE's above-average arm profiles in right field, but his below-average speed does limit his range somewhat.Patience will be the key for GPE, who still has a high ceiling. If everything clicks, he's the type of player who could hit in the middle of a lineup.",0
"After demolishing the ORGANIZATION (as was expected), PERSON had a solid 38 game run at Double-A. He turned 21 in GPE. He's hit everywhere he's been since high school and continues to look fine, if unspectacular, at shortstop. He's above-average in every way at the plate (the bat control, power, feel for opposite field contact, ability to punish mistakes) which means he's got a good chance to be an All Star if he stays at shortstop, and it looks like he's going to.",1
"After hitting 13 homers as a sophomore last spring and then leading the GPE collegiate national team in all three slash stats at .372/.500/.535 last summer, PERSON positioned himself well in a 2018 Draft with a notable lack of catchers. But he has confounded scouts by not making more progress offensively, and they now wonder if his defense might be better than his bat. He still shows decent potential both ways, which along with his track record will make him one of the first backstops selected.PERSON's raw power is his best offensive trait, the product of strength and good-not-great bat speed, though there are questions as to how consistently he'll get to it in pro ball. He looks to crush everything to his pull side, leaving him vulnerable on the outer half of the plate. He has managed the strike zone well in college but his approach could get exploited by pro pitchers.PERSON has made strides behind the plate this spring, cleaning up his receiving and improving his framing skills. He has average arm strength that plays up a bit because he gets rid of the ball quickly and makes accurate throws. He does a nice job of running a pitching staff.",0
"Perhaps the most bizarre prospect in a strange draft, FACILITY is a backwards (throws left, bats right), plus-running first baseman who some scouts want to see tried in center field. Other scouts find that idea inscrutable as FACILITY is a potential plus-plus defender at first, though, while he has great bat to ball skills, he lacks the game power associated with that position.",0
"A seventh-round pick by the ORGANIZATION out of a GPE high school in 2010, PERSON opted to attend PERSON instead. He ranked seventh in ORGANIZATION Division I with 11.0 strikeouts per nine innings in 2013 -- one spot ahead of GPE. 1 overall pick PERSON -- but PERSON lasted until the fourth round because scouts were concerned that his over-reliance on his slider had sapped his velocity.PERSON's slider still is his best pitch, a mid-80s breaker with a lot of bite. The ORGANIZATION are calling for his slider a lot less than PERSON did, and his fastball has perked up. He's working in the low 90s with good sink that induces a lot of groundouts.The brother of ORGANIZATION third-base prospect PERSON, PERSON has a rudimentary changeup. He shows the control and command to remain in the rotation, though some scouts worry that his crossfire delivery puts too much stress on his shoulder and believe he'd last longer as a sinker/slider reliever.",0
"PERSON was one of the top talents in his July 2 class and got the biggest bonus ($3.2 million) the ORGANIZATION handed out in their pool-busting effort. PERSON was seen then as a mature-framed corner type with massive raw power, but there were questions about his contact and athleticism for defense. Those are still the issues to worry about here. Reports are that PERSON has slimmed and will continue playing third base in 2019, where his plus arm has a chance to play, unlike at first base, which is his most likely destination long-term. There was some chatter of developing PERSON on the mound, either exclusively or as a two-way player, but nothing came of it. In his age-19 and 20 seasons at Low-A, he hit 23 homers in 488 plate appearances, so he can already get to his grade-70 or 80 raw power in games (one source mentioned a 117 mph exit velo), but he also struck out over 30% of the time during that stretch. This is starting to feel like a Quad-A power hitter who only gets a big league cup of coffee or has a short-lived platoon/bench role, but he's also still just 21, so we'll give the raw tools and pedigree the benefit of the doubt for one more year.",0
" Not the biggest pitcher in the 2015 Draft class, PERSON's stock took a hit when a stress reaction in his back forced him to the sidelines for most of his senior season. The ORGANIZATION were confident enough in his health to take him in the middle of the first round.When healthy, he has two plus pitches in his 92-94 mph fastball that tops out at 96 and a tight curveball. PERSON's third pitch is a changeup that needs more work. He has an easy delivery that enhances his ability to command his pitches and his chances to remain a starter despite his smaller build.The ORGANIZATION have shown a penchant for developing young pitching in the past and by taking PERSON in the first round, the PERSON regime is showing they're more than willing to go that route again.",1
"At the start of the GPE season, scouts get to watch top talent in warm-weather climates like GPE and GPE. As the spring warms up, which has been slow to happen in 2018, prepsters in places like the ORGANIZATION start to pop up as they can really get going. PERSON has been the case with PERSON, who was dominating high school competition, including a 17-strikeout perfect game, even with it still being cold and rainy in GPE and physically mature, PERSON has been a man amongst boys in his senior season. His fastball sits easily in the 91-92 mph range and is consistently up to 93-95 mph. He commands the fastball and his solid curveball very well, giving high school hitters little chance of success. He shows good arm speed on his changeup, throwing it with fading sink, though he doesn't have to throw it often. He also has a slider, which is behind his curve, a solid pitch that could get shelved as a pro.While PERSON isn't projectable in terms of adding strength, there is growth to come in terms of refining his already-solid stuff under pro tutelage. Committed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE, PERSON's name has been popping up in top three rounds conversations.",0
"The PERSON brothers pitched PERSON (Tallahassee) to the GPE state 3-A championship in 2014, with PERSON spinning a shutout in the semifinals and PERSON pitching four scoreless innings to win the finale. PERSON signed for $1.1 million as a fourth-round pick that June, while PERSON would have gone in about the same area of the 2015 PERSON had he not been strongly committed to PERSON's stuff has backed up a bit, but he's still a projectable left-hander with the potential for three average pitches. His fastball ranged from 90-95 mph when he was in high school but now sits more at 88-91, though he throws it for strikes with armside run. He also has a downer curveball and a fading changeup, and any of his three offerings can be his best on a given night.Like most young pitchers, PERSON needs to add strength and gain more consistency with his secondary pitches and command. If he can do that, he can become a mid-rotation starter.",0
"ORGANIZATION played in both the ORGANIZATION World Series, hitting a home run in GPE game defeat and in the 2013 ORGANIZATION Under-18 World Cup, where he faced a GPE team that included first rounders ORGANIZATION (GPE), ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION), ORGANIZATION (GPE), ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION), ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION) and likely 2017 first round pick C J.J. Schwarz (ORGANIZATION of GPE). ORGANIZATION has average stuff, usually sitting around 90, and a maxed-out frame, but some feel for pitching. Scouts tend to agree that he isn't quite as good at the same stage as PERSON Jen-Ho Tseng, another product of GPE whom they signed in their last international spending spree in 2013 for $1.625 million. Rumors are ORGANIZATION will get as much as $1.5 million and the Cubs are the favorite, but the ORGANIZATION were also in the mix late in the process.",0
"PERSON struck out 133 batters as a LOCATION junior to establish a single-season record, surpassing former big leaguer PERSON on the school's all-time list. The PERSON took him in the second round that June, then assigned him directly to Class A Advanced Frederick for his first full season. PERSON pitched to mixed results early before settling in during the second half, and he built upon that success during a breakout Double-A campaign in 2018. He was named PERSON's ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year and garnered similar honors in the LOCATION after he led the circuit in wins (14), strikeouts (142), and batting average against (.225), and posted the third-best ORGANIZATION (3.27).PERSON's repeatable delivery and clean arm action allow him to paint both sides of the plate with a fastball that sits at 91-94 mph and touches 95. An above-average slider in the low 80s is PERSON's best secondary pitch, and he also demonstrates feel for a changeup that's at least average. He throws each of his three pitches for strikes and is comfortable pitching inside against right-handed hitters with his fastball. While he doesn't generate many ground balls and at times is prone to the long ball, PERSON does induce a healthy number of whiffs and induces weak contact by effectively changing speeds.The PERSON changed PERSON's heel placement on the rubber back in 2017, and that adjustment has helped him stay on line to the plate and better execute his pitches. He still has gains to make both with his control and command, but all the ingredients are there for PERSON to serve as a No. 4 starter, perhaps more, if he continues down his current developmental path.",0
"Wherever PERSON has been, either at ORGANIZATION State during his amateur days or during his climb up the ORGANIZATION' ladder, he's hit. That ability alone has allowed him to reach the highest level of the system.PERSON has been able to make consistent contact and hit for a high average at all levels. He led the ORGANIZATION system in batting average in his first full season in 2013, then hit over .290 in 2014. That continued in 2015, allowing him to earn a promotion from Double- to Triple-A. PERSON draws a lot of walks and doesn't strike out much. He has more gap power than over-the-fence pop, though there are enough flashes to indicate that he could perhaps hit 10-12 homers per season. A good defensive first baseman, his offense didn't fit the profile for the spot, and he moved to left field in 2015.  It's possible PERSON ends up as a fourth outfielder or bat off the bench who can play a corner outfield spot and fill in at first, but as the adage goes, guys that hit tend to find their way into the lineup.",0
"The ORGANIZATION took PERSON two picks after taking PERSON in the first round of the 2013 Draft. PERSON is hopeful the batterymates will one day make their way to PERSON Yards.There's little question that PERSON will hit himself up the ladder. He has a really good feel for hitting, with an approach that helped him win the LOCATION League batting title a year ago. PERSON makes consistent contact with a smooth left-handed stroke and shows good on-base skills as well. There hasn't been a ton of power thus far, but there should be more as he matures and picks spots to turn on balls, rather than just go the other way. A well below-average runner, PERSON's defense is behind his bat, not surprising for a young player who just started catching regularly his senior year of high school. He has arm strength, but the rest of his defensive game is raw. PERSON will need to develop his skills behind the plate to profile as an everyday, offensive-minded, catcher in the big leagues. Just 20 years old, there's time for him to hone his craft.",1
"  After going undrafted out of high school, PERSON broke out during his sophomore year at ORGANIZATION. He became the ORGANIZATION ace and earned a spot on the GPE national team last summer.  PERSON primarily relies on his sinker, which sits around 90 mph with heavy life. He mixes in a slurvy slider and a changeup. He throws a lot of strikes and comes right after hitters with his fastball.  PERSON pitched out of the bullpen with the national team and could move quickly in the ORGANIZATION if he returned there. But with his feel for pitching and three offerings that have a chance to be at least average, he could develop into a Major League starter.",0
"The first of two consecutive high school arms the ORGANIZATION took in the first round, PERSON has followed a developmental path most teams hope a prep pitcher will follow. The GPE native went to full-season ball in his first full professional year and pitched well there under a fairly tight pitch count and innings limit. In year two, the gloves came off and the right-hander earned a midseason promotion to Double-A while also pitching well in the ORGANIZATION Game.Much of PERSON' success has come as a result of his plus fastball. It will sit in the low 90s and will consistently touch the mid-90s with the pitch, thrown with good life down in the zone and improved overall command, allowing him to miss bats. His secondary stuff still needs refinement, and he struggled at times with it after moving up to Double-A, but he can spin a very good curve, has added a slider and has continued to work on developing his changeup.Continued work on his offspeed stuff will help PERSON continue to climb the ORGANIZATION' ladder, but everything is pointing in the right direction. He looks like a future big league starter, and if his non-fastball offerings improve greatly at age 21 in 2018, he could develop into more of a frontline guy.",0
"PERSON didn't pitch in GPE's top league or any of its national teams before he defected, so he was relatively unknown in scouting circles before he started lighting up radar guns at showcases last winter. Six months later, he received a $16 million bonus, the second-largest ever for an international amateur, as the centerpiece of the ORGANIZATION' aggressive international push.PERSON has exceptional arm speed that generates mid-90s fastballs with ease, and he already reached 98 mph with more projection remaining in his 6-foot-3 frame. His secondary offerings lack consistency, though he does flash a plus slider and throws his changeup with deceptive arm speed.The biggest question with PERSON, even more so than his lack of track record, is his ability to harness his stuff. He has trouble finding the strike zone on a regular basis, which could push him toward the bullpen if he can't develop control and command. With his upside, he'll get every opportunity to make it as a starter.",0
"Ever since PERSON began his pro career with the ORGANIZATION back in 2012, he has tantalized with his arm strength and raw stuff, though his performance hasn't always measured up. That has continued since he joined the Reds in the 2015 PERSON deal for PERSON, though he did make his big-league debut in 2017. But in 2018, most of PERSON's season was spent at Double-A before brief stints back in Triple-A and the Majors. His season ended a little early out of precaution because of a left oblique strain.PERSON has a plus fastball that is in the 91-97 mph range, but he can consistently reach for the bigger number when he needs it. He can supplement with an often better-than-average changeup and an average slider. Though he made strides in 2018 with a higher strikeout rate, he also saw his walk rate elevate and his command and control remain fringy.At the moment, PERSON seems projected for the back end of a rotation. However, his development time to returning to the big leagues longer term would be likely shortened by a move to the bullpen. Although he has the overall command issues, that wouldn't be as much of a problem were he to become a two-pitch power reliever.",1
"  PERSON played every position but pitcher and catcher early in his professional career as a result of the infield depth in the GPE organization. But when PERSON was promoted from high Class A GPE in 2013, PERSON got a chance to fill the hole in the infield. He fared better than expected as a full-time shortstop and has continued to build on that initial success.PERSON took a step forward offensively in 2014. Some adjustments he made to his swing in the last couple years have paid off, enabling him to make more consistent contact. He's an above-average runner and has begun to better incorporate his speed into his game. Defensively, PERSON has a plus arm and moves well laterally, giving him plenty of range to both sides. His defensive prowess means that he won't have to hit a ton to carve out a role in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"  PERSON firmly established himself as a player to watch with three home runs at the 2013 Tournament of PERSON, one of the first big events of the summer showcase circuit. He carried that momentum through the 2014 GPE, when the ORGANIZATION made him their first-round pick. PERSON produces impressive raw power and has the feel for hitting necessary to make use of it in games. He has a patient approach at the plate and isn't afraid to work deep in the count to get a pitch he can drive. Though he primarily played first base in high school, the ORGANIZATION moved him to the outfield after the GPE. His arm is plenty strong enough for right field, and he's athletic enough to give him a chance to successfully make the transition to an outfield corner.",0
"It's taken a while for O'Conner to get going, but it looks like this former first-round pick is now headed in the right direction.O'Conner spent three summers in short-season ball before finally graduating to a full-season level in 2013. There, he started to show some of the extra-base ability the ORGANIZATION knew he'd always possessed. O'Conner needs to continue to refine his approach, but he's much improved at tapping into his considerable raw power. Behind the plate, O'Conner has one of the best arms in the Minors, one that allows him to control an opponent's running game. He's still learning the plate, but he has the chance to be an elite defender. It all comes down to O'Conner's bat. If it continues to develop, he has the chance to be an everyday backstop at the highest level.",0
"GPE had been injury free since college (when he dealt with shoulder problems), until 2018, when he had hamstring issues in the spring, and biceps tendinitis later in the summer. The lost innings resulted in an ORGANIZATION stint, during which GPE was arguably the best non-Whitley pitching prospect who was a lock to start. Despite the biceps issue, his velocity was fine in the fall. GPE sits 93-96 and makes heavy use of three good secondary pitches. The horizontal action on his slider only plays away from righties, but the curveball and changeup will help mitigate some of those issues, as well as the platoon issues that may arise from GPE's lower arm slot.",0
"Though PERSON's stuff took a downturn during his junior season at FACILITY, the ORGANIZATION believed in his previous track record enough to take him in the fifth round of the 2015 Draft. He pitched well in his first two years as a pro, then struggled at the upper levels of the system in 2017. He fared better and showed crisper stuff while repeating Triple-A this season and then pitched in the ORGANIZATION before joining the ORGANIZATION in mid-November in exchange for PERSON added a couple ticks of velocity to his fastball in 2018, working at 93-95 mph and topping out at 97 with riding action. His collection of secondary pitches is headlined by a plus curveball in the low-80s that has an elite spin rate. His slider has morphed into a true cutter that he throws with sharp glove-side slicing action and a bit of sink at 88-92 mph. He needs to refine and trust his changeup more to find success against left-handers, however.PERSON has a funky delivery, but it gives him deception and doesn't prevent him from filling the strike zone. With solid stuff and strike-throwing ability, he has the ingredients to become at least a No. 4 starter. But he often gets hit harder than he should, so his long-term role may be as a multi-inning reliever.",0
"GPE isn't big or especially toolsy, but he performed on the ORGANIZATION and put up huge numbers this spring against so-so competition, but he got faster in the interim and now may be a center fielder.",0
GPE has made offensive progress in a big breakout 2019 but we still think he's more likely to end up at first base due in part to his size.,0
"Originally Drafted by the ORGANIZATION, GPE was dealt to GPE for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION in 2011. He made his Major ORGANIZATION debut the next year, and he appeared to be on his way to establishing himself in the ORGANIZATION rotation before undergoing PERSON surgery in July '12. After returning to health and the big leagues in 2014, he was a part of the package the ORGANIZATION acquired in exchange for PERSON's fastball sits around 90 mph, with good late life. His curveball is his best secondary pitch, and his slider and changeup give him two more solid offerings. All of GPE's stuff plays up, thanks to his exceptional command.GPE went through a lengthy recovery process, but pitched well in his return. His tools give him a chance to fit as a starter in the ORGANIZATION and his stuff would also play well in the bullpen.",1
"Because he comes from a tiny town -- PERSON, GPE, which has a population of 2,600 -- and didn't pitch on the showcase circuit last summer, PERSON was relatively unknown before he impressed scouts with his velocity and projectability at ORGANIZATION's World Wood Bat Association World Championship last October. He continued to raise his profile this spring, and the ORGANIZATION grabbed him in the second round.PERSON's best pitch is a hard sinker that runs from 90-94 mph, and it could get quicker as he fills out his frame. His slider improved during his senior season and could become a plus pitch in the future. PERSON also demonstrates some feel for his changeup, though he hasn't had to use it much.PERSON is getting better at repeating his mechanics and commanding his pitches. If he continues to develop like he has in the past year, he eventually could become a front-line starter in the big leagues.",0
"It took a $100,000 bonus to sign PERSON away from a football scholarship to GPE. PERSON raw when he entered pro ball (what with two-sports and a cold-weather background), it took PERSON three years of adjustments before he finally experienced a statistical breakout in 2016. Since then, he has continued to make mechanical tweaks to reshape his skillset, and was rewarded with a brief major league debut in 2018. 
Once in possession of ugly bat control that enabled him to put lots of balls in play but not with any real impact, PERSON's most recent swing adjustment has him trading some of that contact for power. As PERSON's leg kick grew bigger and slower, his ground ball rate shrunk. A 45% roller ratio in 2017 became 31% in 2018, and PERSON set a career-high in homers (12) in the friendly confines of the ORGANIZATION. Though he didn't perform during a 30-game big league look, PERSON's athleticism and ability to make adjustments bode well for his future. His baseball instincts aren't great, but he has some pop that he's started to get to, he can fly, and he may get lots of playing time due to the ORGANIZATION' fairly thin outfield situation. Realistically, he projects as a good bench outfielder, but he has several late-bloomer traits and may continue to develop into a low-end regular if he falls into regular big league reps and gets sufficient at-bats.",1
"The ORGANIZATION rolled the dice in the 2015 Draft when they took PERSON in ORGANIZATION B. The ORGANIZATION A&M left-hander had dealt with thoracic outlet syndrome early in his collegiate career, and then his junior season ended after four starts when he needed PERSON surgery. It's looking like the gamble is paying off, as PERSON's power stuff allowed him to dominate out of the bullpen upon his return and reach Double-A during his first pro season.Since returning, PERSON's fastball has touched the 94-97 mph range consistently. He's backed up that heater with a very good cutter that can touch the low 90s. He now has a distinct slider that gives him a third viable option. PERSON goes right after hitters, misses a lot of bats and doesn't hurt himself with ORGANIZATION key for PERSON is to stay healthy. If his injury woes are in the past, he has the ability to be a very effective left-handed setup man at the big league level.",1
"PERSON became eligible to turn pro as a 16-year-old in 2008, but no one signed him out of GPE before the ORGANIZATION offered him a $7,500 bonus at the relatively advanced age of 20, four years later. Though he didn't make his pro debut until 2013, or reach full-season ball until this year, his fastball has already caught the attention of scouts.PERSON throws harder than most left-handers, dealing at 92-94 mph, and popping 97 mph on occasion. The tradeoff is that his velocity comes from a max-effort delivery, which doesn't bode well for his command or future health.PERSON's slider lacks consistency but has its moments, arriving in the low 80s, with some sharp bite at its best. He hasn't demonstrated much aptitude for a changeup. Although PERSON is currently using PERSON as a starter to get him innings and experience, his future likely will be as a reliever.",0
"GPE turned down close to a million dollars out of high school from the ORGANIZATION, then dominated out of the pen and now in the rotation for GPE; the delivery isn't pretty but the results are and the stuff is above average to plus.",1
"It can take the raw, toolsy athletes a little bit longer to develop at times, but PERSON could look back at the 2013 season as the year where it really started coming together.Tall and athletic, PERSON looks the part of a toolsy center fielder and now needs to build on his first extended success. He's started to learn to tap into his raw power, pulling the ball with authority instead of being satisfied with going up the middle and the other way. There's still some length and swing and miss to PERSON's game, but if he can continue to punish mistakes on the inner half, he could be dangerous. With enough speed to steal some bases, PERSON has the tools to stay in center, but he could handle a corner if needed.Patience can be a virtue with athletic players like PERSON, and the ORGANIZATION could soon be rewarded as a result.",1
"When a GPE teenager comes and makes his GPE debut, the organization hopes he can just adjust and hold his own. PERSON went out and won the ORGANIZATION League batting title while ripping off a 29-game hitting streak.With an easy left-handed swing, PERSON has a knack for making consistent solid contact. He doesn't strike out much, nor does he draw many walks. There's more power to come as PERSON continues to mature. He's played all over the outfield and has the speed to stay in center field for now. Should PERSON outgrow the position, he has more than enough arm to play right field and could profile well there when all is said and done.PERSON will play all of the 2014 season at age 20, giving full-season ball a try for the first time.",1
" PERSON has been well traveled since the FACILITY drafted him in the second round in 2009. First, he was sent to the D-backs in the ORGANIZATION trade at the 2010 PERSON. He worked his way from rookie ball to the ORGANIZATION with PERSON, making his big league debut in August 2013. That winter, he was dealt again, this time to the ORGANIZATION as a part of a three-team trade. PERSON has the chance to have four average or better pitches with good command of all of them. He works quickly and goes right after hitters, working both sides of the strike zone with his solid average sinking fastball. His fading changeup is an above-average offering and he throws both a tight biting curve and short, cutting slider. With good mechanics and size, he should be ready for the middle of the rotation very soon.",1
"PERSON grew 10 inches and added about 12 mph to his fastball during his ORGANIZATION high school career, attracting pro interest but sliding to the 30th round of the 2010 Draft because he couldn't be coaxed from attending college at ORGANIZATION. A ninth-round choice by the ORGANIZATION after three years with the ORGANIZATION, PERSON plateaued as a starter when he got to high Class A but began to move rapidly after shifting to the bullpen in July 2016. He ranked second among the system's full-season relievers with a 2.20 ERA in 2017 and was similarly effective in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON's feel for pitching stands out more than any of his individual offerings. He has picked up some velocity working shorter stints, and his fastball now operates at 91-93 mph and tops out at 95. It features plenty of run and sink, helping him log a 2.33 groundout/airout ratio last season and a 2.06 mark in his first five pro seasons.When working out of the rotation, PERSON had difficulty maintaining a consistent arm slot. He's doing a better job of keeping his delivery in sync while coming out of the bullpen, which has helped his slider improve. He has an effective changeup that helps him combat right-handers, though with three average pitches he's likely destined for middle relief.",0
"PERSON was a standout at high school power ORGANIZATION, originally taken by the ORGANIZATION in the eighth round of the 2013 Draft. He'd hit at pretty much every stop in GPE's chain, reaching Double-A in 2017, then was sent to the ORGANIZATION in January 2018 as one of four players in return for another ORGANIZATION alum, GPE. PERSON excelled in Double-A for the first half of his first season with PERSON, then struggled after getting bumped up to Triple-A, earning a spot on the 40-man roster in the process.More than anything, PERSON tried to do too much when he got moved to the ORGANIZATION' highest level. His swing got out of sync and he was often too quick, resulting in rolling over from being out in front too often. There is some power in the bat, power he has unlocked throughout his pro career, but it often can be his own worst enemy, as he can get pull-happy and ends up out in front. PERSON does run well enough to steal some bases, though not so efficiently, and his speed gives him range to play center, though his below-average arm might be better suited to left field if he's a regular.While PERSON has improved somewhat against left-handed pitching, most of his power comes against righties. He fits more of a fourth outfielder or platoon role, though if he shows he can adjust to Triple-A, he could prove he's more of a regular.",1
"GPE was the ORGANIZATION. 1 starter on PERSON's 2013 College World Series team, ahead of third-rounders PERSON (GPE) and PERSON (ORGANIZATION). He surprisingly lasted until the 11th round that June but shook that off to turn in a fine season as a starter in low Class A in 2014.There's little question that GPE's fastball is his best pitch. He works at 90-94 mph with some occasional life and uses his height to deliver it on a steep downhill plane. He does have a sturdy frame built for starting and has no difficulty filling the strike zone.Nevertheless, GPE may be destined for the bullpen. Both his slider and changeup are below-average offerings, and he leaves them up in the strike zone too often.",0
"Most teams didn't evaluate PERSON as a first-round talent in the 2013 Draft, but the ORGANIZATION loved his bat, so they drafted him 25th overall and paid him a $1,866,500 bonus. He has justified their faith, winning the Rookie-level PERSON MVP award in his pro debut and finishing second in the short-season LOCATION in hitting (.333) in 2014. Last year he skipped a level to high Class A and batted .304 at age 20.PERSON is an extremely advanced hitter for his age, with outstanding hand-eye coordination that allows him to barrel balls repeatedly. He almost does so too easily, making so much hard contact that it cuts into his walk totals. Being more selective also would help his power totals, as he has the bat speed to produce 15 homers per season if he waits for pitches he can drive.PERSON has sure hands and solid arm strength at shortstop, but his fringy speed and range likely will lead to a position change down the line. PERSON thinks he's an underrated defender but also has PERSON at shortstop and PERSON at second base in the big leagues. PERSON might profile best at third base and also could wind up on an outfield corner.",1

" PERSON excelled as GPE's closer for two seasons and set the school's single-season record with 19 saves as a junior. But scouts worried about his lack of a quality breaking ball and he slid to the 13th round in the 2012 Draft. So far, PERSON has made those fears appear unfounded. He made quick work of the GPE League and earned a promotion to Double-A Arkansas in his first full professional season. PERSON throws his fastball in the low-90s and occasionally reaches back for a little extra velocity. His main weapon is his changeup, which is a plus offering. PERSON commands both of his pitches well and isn't afraid to challenge hitters. The ORGANIZATION have used him as a closer in the ORGANIZATION, but he profiles better as a set-up man in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"In terms of electric stuff and arm strength, PERSON has to sit near the top of most Draft boards. Some concerns about his delivery and his secondary stuff, might temper his stock somewhat.There is no question about PERSON's fastball. Delivered with a quick arm, PERSON can crank it up to 96-97 mph. At ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION, the right-hander had the top average fastball velocity according to GPE, at 94.4 mph. He does show good feel to spin a breaking ball, but it tends to be too slurvy. PERSON will call it a curveball, but it often has more of a slider shape to it, and he can't always land it for strikes. He actually has a feel for a changeup, but he doesn't often use it.PERSON is a high energy pitcher with a ton of personality on the mound, one who will quick pitch or feature a PERSON Cueto-like shimmy in his delivery. There is some effort there as well, leading some to wonder if he profiles as a reliever. There is some projectability in his body, he should add strength, and he's a better athlete than one might think at first glance. A team taking him early and signing him away from his LOCATION commitment will give him every chance to start.Prospect ORGANIZATION - PERSON, GPE.",0

The ORGANIZATION drafted him in the fourth round the following year, making PERSON the first Nebraskan prep to be picked in the top five rounds since 1996. After having his first full pro season marred by injury, PERSON moved up to Class A Hagerstown in '16 and flashed his potential on both sides of the ball. While hasn't built on that performance as hoped this season, GPE was pleased enough with PERSON's progress that they promoted him to the ORGANIZATION in July. A right-handed hitter, PERSON has a quick swing that yields line drives across the whole field. The ORGANIZATION worked with PERSON to improve his lower-half setup during the season, and it resulted in harder contact and better pitch recognition as the season unfolded. He's physically strong and has average power potential, though it may be a few years before he learns how to get to it in games. Even if the power never arrives, PERSON's plate discipline and approach give him the chance to be a quality hitter.PERSON is a good athlete with a solid set of tools that could help him stick behind the plate, and the ORGANIZATION have been pleased with his progress as a receiver and game-caller. Though still quite raw, he has solid-to-average arm strength and promising catch-and-throw skills.",0
"A 16th-round Draft pick in 2011, PERSON etched his name in GPE postseason lore with his performance in Game 5 of the ORGANIZATION Championship Series against the ORGANIZATION. Called on to make a spot start, the left-hander tossed 4 1/3 scoreless innings, allowing just two hits and retiring 12 of the 14 hitters he faced, to propel the Tribe to a 3-0 victory and its sixth ORGANIZATION pennant.What PERSON lacks in stuff he makes up for with pitchability and excellent command. The left-hander adds and subtracts from his upper-80s fastball and complements it with an above-average changeup. He knows how to use his curveball effectively while also mixing in a below-average slider simply to keep hitters guessing and off balance. Everything he throws plays up thanks to his plus control, as he entered the 2017 season having issued just 108 walks in 684 1/3 professional innings (1.4 BB/9).After his impressive showing in the postseason, PERSON has already been up and down with the GPE several times this season. His lack of premium stuff and perennially low strikeout rate limits his upside, but he has all the tools to serve as a fifth starter or swingman in the big leagues.",1
"The fact PERSON was called up to the big leagues to help out for a brief spell in 2014 may have been a bit surprising. The fact the young middle infielder handled himself like a veteran during his five-game stay surprised no one.While his Major League debut was a stopgap measure, there's little question PERSON will get back to the highest level for a much longer stay soon. Much of that is because of his advanced bat. A switch-hitter, PERSON has a great approach at the plate, making consistent contact to all fields with some slowly developing extra-base pop. A solid average to tick-above-average runner, PERSON played mostly second base early in his career. He started focusing on shortstop in 2014, and he has the range and hands to play there, with an average arm, and he's working on his footwork to allow his throws to have more carry across the infield.PERSON has the skills to be an everyday shortstop, and the Twins know he can shift back to second base at any time and become a big league regular on the right side of the infield as well.",1
"After claiming LOCATION pitcher of the year honors as a sophomore and continuing to pitch well in the ORGANIZATION and during fall practice, ORGANIZATION entered 2017 as a potential second-rounder. While his stuff wasn't as sharp during his junior season, he still led the LOCATION in wins (nine) and ORGANIZATION (1.89) and became the highest Draft pick in GPE history. A third-rounder, he signed for a slightly below-slot $600,000.ORGANIZATION can hit 96 mph with heavy sink on his fastball, though he spent most of the spring working at 88-92 and topping out at 94 with less action on his heater. He has complete trust in his changeup, which shows flashes of becoming a plus pitch but was more of an average offering during his final season with the GPE. So did his curveball and cutter, which show signs of turning into solid offerings.While ORGANIZATION lacks ideal size, there's no obvious reason he can't remain in the rotation. He got stronger in college, has no issues repeating his delivery and pounds the strike zone. He's fearless on the mound and has a high ceiling as a relatively good bet to become a No. 4 starter.",0
"GPE spent his freshman year as PERSON's starting shortstop before moving to catcher as a sophomore in 2016. He earned PERSON all-star honors at his new position that summer, leading the circuit with 72 total bases, and hit for more power than ever this spring. The fourth college catcher drafted in June, he signed for $547,500 as a third-rounder.GPE should be able to hit for average because he uses a simple right-handed swing, recognizes pitches well and manages the strike zone. While he's not very physical, he has some sneaky power. His best tool is actually his above-average speed, making him a rarity among catchers, and he has the instincts to steal a few bases.Though he's quick and athletic behind the plate, he needs to polish his throwing and receiving but has the tools to be at least average in both regards. Because he's small for a catcher -- his listed 5-foot-11 and 180 pounds may be generous -- some scouts worry about whether he can handle the workload of a long pro season. If he can't, he could make for a dynamic utilityman because he can play almost anywhere on the diamond.",0
"Built like an old school in-the-box ORGANIZATION safety, GPE is a physical dynamo whose entire offensive profile is undercut by his extreme propensity to hit the ball into the ground. GPE has a nearly 60% ground ball rate over each of the last two years. He does a lot of other stuff: he has raw power, great feel for the strike zone, and is a plus runner, with well-regarded makeup. The quality of his in-game contact is simply not good right now. Stiffness in GPE's hitting hands could mean this issue is less about a swing change than it is about innate talent.",0
"PERSON's exciting GPE debut in 2013, followed by his ability to hold his own in the LOCATION League in 2014, has the organization excited about his potential to become an everyday shortstop, even if it's way off in the future.Signed in 2011, PERSON performed very well in the short-season PERSON in '13. A left-handed-hitting shortstop, he has good bat speed at the plate, though added strength and a better knowledge of the strike zone will help his offensive game. PERSON has excellent speed, which should help him on both sides of the ball. He has the range and the arm to stay at shortstop long-term. PERSON is not going to move PERSON off of shortstop anytime soon, and the ORGANIZATION will be sure not to rush him, but PERSON does give GPE a middle infielder who will definitely stick at the premium position long-term.",0
"Scouts were flocking to PERSON this spring to check in on PERSON, who has as much arm strength as any pitcher in the GPE class.The big, strong right-hander has an easily plus heater, one that sits comfortably in the mid-90s and he's shown the ability to crank it up to triple-digits this spring. Unlike many hard throwers, PERSON's velocity comes from a clean and easy delivery without much effort. He'll also show a solid-average curveball and will occasionally flash a decent changeup. What he struggles the most with is throwing strikes, with well below-average command tempering enthusiasm.That said, this kind of power arm doesn't grow on trees and a team that thinks they can help fix his command or send him to the bullpen as a fireballing short reliever is likely to take him in the early stages of the GPE.",0
"PERSON was the FACILITY's first draft choice in 2011 in the supplemental first round â they didn't have a first-round choice due to the free agent signing of PERSON â and PERSON literally hit the ground running during his first full season, leading the organization with 56 steals while playing across two levels. The former GPE product has some on-base skills, drawing walks and getting on with infield hits. He also strikes out too much and hasn't shown much power, though there might be some if he can learn to make more consistent contact. His speed gives him the ability to cover a lot of ground in center field. Whether PERSON can become a more complete hitter will help determine if he's an everyday center fielder at the top of a big league lineup or just an extra outfielder who can help out with his speed.",0
GPE has been hurt a lot throughout his career but has been healthy for the last two seasons. He sits in the low-90s and has a plus changeup.,1
"PERSON's amateur career didn't exactly go on a straight path, starting at ORGANIZATION, going to PERSON and then on to GPE for his junior year in 2018. He showed glimpses of premium stuff in both starting and relief roles, but put up ugly numbers overall. The ORGANIZATION took a chance on the power repertoire in the sixth round of the ORGANIZATION and PERSON has responded by being one of the biggest surprises of the class, though some minor shoulder soreness did shelve him for a time during his first full season.The 6-foot-4 right-hander has always shown a ton with his fastball and he's been regularly up to 97 mph in all of his starts. His changeup has been his best secondary offering so far, a pitch with late splitter-like actions that has depth and he throws with deception at any point in the count. One of the biggest reasons for his step forward is how well he's commanded both his fastball and changeup. His slider is his third pitch, and while he'll occasionally shown a plus one, it's been inconsistent.When PERSON was preparing to enter pro ball, many thought he was destined to land in the bullpen. The ORGANIZATION feel his command of his best two pitches point to a future as a starter, with the development of his breaking ball the key to him sticking in that role.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON, PERSON, who is also a center on PERSON's (Ariz.) basketball team, has committed to play baseball at the ORGANIZATION of LOCATION. He was also a member of the 17U ORGANIZATION Development Program in 2016, where he pitched in two games, including one scoreless outing.Schapira has a good body with long limbs and a sinking fastball. The left-hander also has a good delivery.",0
"PERSON looked like the prototypical pitchability college lefty after two strong seasons at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, including a starring role in the ORGANIZATION World Series. He backed that up by pitching most of his first full season of pro ball in Double-A after the ORGANIZATION took him in the fifth round of the 2015 Draft. A combination of so-so performance and injuries have caused him to stall a bit.PERSON does have a good feel to pitch and knows how to move the ball around the zone. But he tends to nibble too much and work off the plate, leading to a much higher walk rate than is desirable from a finesse lefty. He has average stuff across the board, with a fastball that sits around 90-91 mph and works best when he keeps it down in the zone to get groundball outs, an average slider and a changeup that usually has good fade to it. The ORGANIZATION have preached to him about being more efficient and force contact earlier in counts because he is not overly physical and long innings will make it harder for him to hold up as a starter. He did have two disabled list stints with a forearm strain in 2017.PERSON made up for some lost innings and pitched largely in relief in the ORGANIZATION, throwing better during that limited stretch. He doesn't really have the stuff to be pitch out of the pen, so he'll have to make strides in attacking hitters to reach his potential as a back-end starter.",0
"Texas-Brownsville shuttered their baseball program before PERSON was able to take the field for them, and he ended up transferring to PERSON. He spent his sophomore year at PERSON injured, then went undrafted as a junior. He was discovered by the ORGANIZATION at a workout near the GPE border and later signed, then was traded to GPE as part of the ORGANIZATION blockbuster. He's a low-slot bullpen slinger with a tailing, upper-90s fastball, and his arm slot creates issues for righties. He needs to refine command of the breaking ball to better deal with lefties, but just on arm strength and fastball movement, he profiles as a fine middle relief option, at least.",0
"ORGANIZATION PERSON has been a must-stop for this year's PERSON season for a number of reasons. It starts with potential first-rounders in right-hander PERSON and infielder PERSON and includes another Top 100 prospect in righty PERSON. PERSON looked like he could be in that same grouping during a solid performance on the summer showcase circuit. A knee injury slowed him early and got him off of his game a little bit during his senior season.When he's at his best, PERSON looks like he has the chance to be a very good hitter at the next level. When he's on time with his swing, he shows the ability to drive the ball the other way, making it easier to dream about him being an above-average hitter with at least average power down the line. He's struggled this spring to stay on the ball long enough, perhaps pressing to make up for lost time. A decent athlete who runs well underway, he should be a solid defender at the hot corner with enough arm to stay there in the long-term.Teams willing to consider PERSON based more on his summer and fall than his spring performance might see a player who belongs closer in the conversation with his ORGANIZATION teammates. His up-and-down spring, however, might make it tougher for teams to take him early enough to sign him away from playing for the ORGANIZATION of GPE.",0
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $35,000 as a 24th-round pick in 2013 after he had spent three years in LOCATION's starting rotation. He broke out the next year, when he was the Rookie-level PERSON of the Year and broke PERSON's Class A Great Lakes single-game strikeout record with 14. He led the Minors in whiffs per nine innings (12.8) in 2015, then dominated Triple-A and made his big league debut with the ORGANIZATION in '16, only to be traded to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for PERSON during the offseason. Though he would make his ORGANIZATION debut in May, PERSON spent much of 2017 on the shelf with right forearm and lat strains and had his entire '18 campaign wiped out by PERSON surgery. He made a healthy return to the mound in the ORGANIZATION State League this May before joining Triple-A PERSON's starting rotation. PERSON's rash of injuries impacted his velocity, and he was sitting in the 88-92 mph range upon joining the ORGANIZATION after previously working at 92-94 and bumping 96. Since returning from ORGANIZATION surgery, the right-hander has been consistently 91-95 mph and throwing his heater with late life up in the zone. PERSON's changeup is still his his best secondary pitch, a legitimate plus offering that plays nicely off of his fastball, and he also throws a slider that's effective when he gets right-handers to chase it off the plate.PERSON has a strong track record as a strike-thrower, though it likely will take him some time to regain the control and command he had before his myriad injuries. He still has the upside of a big league starter, at this point likely a No. 4 or No. 5, though he'll need to stay healthy in order to achieve such potential.",1
"GPE of a ORGANIZATION Jays 2011 international class that provided plenty of trade fodder, PERSON signed for $400,000 out of GPE and went to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION deal four years later. He starred in low Class A immediately after switching organizations, but his delivery fell apart the following spring and he went 3-11 with a 6.86 ERA at two Class A stops in 2016. His fortunes suddenly reversed again last year, where he embraced changes to his mechanics, finished strong and earned a spot on GPE's 40-man roster.PERSON's best pitch is his fastball that usually ranges from 93-95 mph and tops out at 97 with sink. He has a pair of power breaking balls, with his curveball and slider both plus pitches at their best but also inconsistent. He's making strides with his changeup though it still ranks as his fourth-best pitch.PERSON's downturn came when his delivery became too violent, causing him to fall off toward first base and lose any semblance of command. He has cleaned up his mechanics, taking a more direct route to the plate and doing a better job of locating his pitches. Though the ORGANIZATION will continue to develop him as a starter, he could have success as a late-inning reliever with a power arsenal.",1
"A young PERSON -- big, athletic, wiry and full of potential -- is PERSON's best comp at the same age. PERSON today is an above-average defender who has a talent for reading and picking up balls off the bat. He gets good jumps, takes great angles and routes using his plus plus speed. In other words, he can fly out there. His arm has above-average potential.At the plate, PERSON covers the strike zone well and hits everything hard. He has a knack for barreling up balls and has future average power. He projects to hit second or third in the lineup, but could eventually be the leadoff hitter because of his hit tool and plus running abilities. He projects to steal between 15 and 25 bases in the big leagues. He's also been praised for his makeup and baseball IQ.In the end, PERSON could end up at 6-foot-4 and 225 pounds if he continues to develop at a normal pace. PERSON is trained by PERSON. The ORGANIZATION are the favorites to sign him.",1
"GPE began his professional career with the ORGANIZATION as a catcher, with the GPE, Fla., native spending his first two summers of pro ball at rookie levels behind the plate after being a 12th-round Draft pick in 2013. The combination of raw defensive skills and advanced abilities at the plate led the ORGANIZATION to move GPE to second base and he hit his way up to Double-A, not to mention the 40-man roster following the 2017 season. He was part of the package for PERSON sent to the ORGANIZATION, who then turned around and dealt him to the ORGANIZATION for outfield prospect PERSON Stowers.The ORGANIZATION believe in GPE's bat and see him as the second baseman of the future in the organization. ORGANIZATION and strong, he's shown a consistent ability to drive the ball from the left side of the plate, with quick hands generating the bat speed for solid power numbers. There will always be some swing and miss to his game, but he also draws a fair amount of walks. While far from a burner, he's a very good baserunner who has the ability to steal some bases.The biggest question about GPE is his glove, which has been fringy at best. Getting to work with infield instructor PERSON and veteran PERSON should help him maximize his defensive value and enhance the chances he can live up to those expectations as a big league regular.",1
"Originally recruited by PERSON as a pitcher, PERSON became a full-time hitter after having shoulder surgery as a freshman. His power enticed the ORGANIZATION to draft him in the third round in 2012 and he led the system with 25 homers during his first full pro season. Another surgery cut his 2014 season short, as he underwent PERSON surgery in April.PERSON packs a lot of strength in his 6-foot-5, 240-pound frame, giving him power to all fields. PERSON sees him as more than just a masher. While PERSON can have trouble with breaking balls, he made some nice adjustments in the second half of 2013. PERSON is a better athlete than most players his size, as he has close to average speed and moves well in the outfield. When healthy, he has a strong arm and fits the right-field profile well.",0
"  PERSON graduated a semester early from PERSON (Fla.) and enrolled at GSP in 2012, bypassing the GPE in the process. He'll be eligible for the first time this year, and he shouldn't have to wait long to hear his name. PERSON has established himself as a solid all-around catcher in his three years at GSP. He is a capable, durable receiver with an average arm and a quick release.  PERSON is a switch-hitter and has a quick, compact swing from both sides of the plate. He has some pop now, but scouts think his swing portends average power in the future. Because he graduated from high school early, he is one of the youngest college players in the GPE class.",0
"PERSON wasn't the only first-round pick the ORGANIZATION acquired from the Athletics in the ORGANIZATION trade last July. ORGANIZATION was the 24th overall pick in 2013, when he was regarded as one of the best pure hitters available in that Draft. He has lived up to that billing since signing for $1.8 million, with his only significant adversity coming when he fouled a ball off his right knee and sustained a hairline fracture of his kneecap in mid-August.ORGANIZATION should continue to hit because he has a smooth left-handed swing, outstanding hand-eye coordination, bat speed and an advanced approach. There's some question as to how much power he'll produce, but he barrels balls so easily that he should provide plenty of doubles with a peak of 18-20 homers per year.ORGANIZATION played mostly center field in GPE's system but shifted to right field after the trade. His average speed is better suited for a corner, though his instincts and aggressiveness allow him to play quicker than that on the bases and in the outfield. His fringy arm strength ultimately may relegate him to left field.",1
"PERSON ORGANIZATION has five Draft-eligible pitchers who can reach the mid-90s with their fastballs. Of that group, PERSON has the best pure stuff but also the most violent delivery.PERSON's heater sits at 92-94 mph and touches 96. It can be overpowering at times, though it also can be hittable because it's fairly straight and he leaves it up in the strike zone more than he should. His best offering is actually his tight 84-87 mph slider, one of the best breaking balls in the Draft.PERSON relies heavily on his slider, which leads to concerns about his long-term health, as does his maximum-effort delivery. He's physically mature at 6-foot-1 and 205 pounds, so what you see is what you get, but he does have two plus big league offerings.",0
"An above-slot $375,000 signing as a 12th-rounder in 2013, PERSON won pitcher of the year accolades from both the ORGANIZATION and the high Class A ORGANIZATION in 2016. He entered last year as the best mound prospect in the upper levels of the system, but returning nearby where he grew up to pitch for Double-A PERSON proved to be too much of a distraction. He got hammered to the tune of a 7.99 ERA during the final three months, earning a mandate from club officials to get stronger mentally and physically.During his breakout 2016 season, PERSON operated with a 91-94 mph fastball that touched 97, flashed a plus curveball and improved his changeup. Last year, he lost weight and his stuff regressed, with his fastball dropping into the upper 80s and his curveball deserting him. He has regained his velocity in 2018, when he also has shown a more reliable curve and had some success with his cutter and changeup.Control and command never were PERSON's strong suits and they also regressed in 2017 before bouncing back this year. He has toned down his delivery since entering pro ball but it still some features some effort, so there long have been questions whether he'd be better suited for relief work. He moved near the ORGANIZATION' training base in GPE so he could better prepare for 2018, when he has gotten his career back on track.",0
"GPE, power projection corner outfielder that has just okay feel to hit currently but it also young for the class.",0
"PERSON didn't produce a first-round pick in the first 50 Drafts before the ORGANIZATION took PERSON (who didn't sign) in 2015, and they came back last year for PERSON. One of four ORGANIZATION catchers taken in the first 43 choices last June, PERSON stood out with his athleticism and throwing ability. Though he didn't put up big offensive numbers in his pro debut, he did advance to high Class A.PERSON is a rare catcher who earns some plus grades for his speed, and his quickness helps his solid arm strength play even better. He threw out 42 percent of attempted basestealers in his introduction to pro ball while displaying advanced receiving skills and good agility behind the plate. PERSON even gave him playing time at second and third base as well.After hitting a combined .235 with two homers in his first two college seasons, PERSON boosted his stock by batting .382 with seven homers as a junior. He emphasizes making contact with a short right-handed stroke, though he did strike out 50 times in 55 games when he was pushed quickly during his debut. He has a bit of pull power but is much more of an on-base machine than a slugger.",1
"PERSON showed the makings of becoming an offensive-minded second baseman in his first full season, when he hit .320 with 37 extra-base hits between the Class A and Class A Advanced levels. But the 2012 third-round failed to progress at the plate last year in his return to the ORGANIZATION State League, finishing his second full season with a .259 average and just 18 extra-base hits. PERSON's bat-to-ball skills and quick right-handed stroke generate a lot of line-drive contact, and he does a good job of spraying the ball across the whole field. He's aggressive to a fault at times and will force contact rather than work the count, though it also makes him difficult to strike out. PERSON is physically strong and has good pop to the gaps, but he's unlikely to offer much in the way of over-the-fence power.A shortstop in high school, PERSON shifted to second base after turning pro and has shown steady improvement as he's gotten more comfortable at his new position. However, it's his bat that will be his ticket to the ORGANIZATION, and the ORGANIZATION believe he'll get back on track at the plate in 2016.",0
"The latest in a long line of GPE high school fireballers, PERSON missed much of his junior season at ORGANIZATION after he broke his left arm in an infield collision while playing first base. He made a dramatic return to the mound in June, hitting 99 mph with his fastball at an PERSON Games tryout and peaking at 97 at the ORGANIZATION. He pitched at 93-96 mph for most of the summer and hit 99 again at the ORGANIZATION All-America Classic in GPE. PERSON has pushed his fastball to 100 mph and above several times this spring, even out of the stretch. He throws both a 12-to-6 curveball and a sharp slider, and though the slider is newer to him, it has more upside. He rarely uses a changeup, but it has the potential to become an average offering. The only real knock on PERSON is that his control and command have yet to catch up to his premium stuff. That still hasn't prevented him from becoming a contender to go No. 1 overall to the nearby PERSON. His younger brother PERSON, a right-hander who can run his fastball into the low 90s, could be an early-round pick in 2015.",0
"Signed at age 18 by the Mariners in July 2014, PERSON made the jump stateside for his pro debut last season and finished the year in the ORGANIZATION A Short PERSON. His performance caught the attention of the ORGANIZATION, who acquired him in November in the ORGANIZATION trade. He dominated in his full-season debut at ORGANIZATION A Fort Wayne in 2016 and earned a promotion to ORGANIZATION A Advanced Lake Elsinore in early June. PERSON has already shown rapid improvement since he began his pro career, and there might be plenty more left in the tank. His fastball usually sits between 93-95 mph and has been gunned as high as 97, and he throws it with plenty of life down in the zone, leading to a good amount of groundball outs. He already shows feel for an average curveball that he can throw for a strike, while his changeup shows glimpses of becoming an above-average pitch. PERSON floods the zone with strikes and has natural bat-missing ability, and scouts expect him to induce even more whiffs with improved control and command. He might be far off from being big league ready, but there's a lot to like in this promising right-hander.",1
"PERSON had been a big part of GPE State's pitching staff as a freshman in 2015 and at the start of the 2016 season, though he needed PERSON surgery in March of that year. After returning in late April in 2017, and pitching well in short stints, the ORGANIZATION took the right-hander with the 31st overall pick in the GPE. Citing discrepencies between the pre-GPE and post-GPE ORGANIZATION, the ORGANIZATION didn't sign PERSON. He was set to return to the ORGANIZATION' pitching staff when he required a second TJ surgery in September, missing the entire season.At this point, it's hard to know what to expect from PERSON when he does come back. In all likelihood, he'd be viewed as a reliever only given his medical history, and his stuff did look good a year ago in those shorter outings. He was showing a fastball in the 92-96 mph range in his limited time back, thrown with good extension and getting swings and misses with it. He was getting back to average feel of his slider rand changeup the more he threw during ORGANIZATION's postseason run a year ago. PERSON does have three effective pitches and a starter's delivery, not to mention some track record of success in that role. But after two elbow surgeries, his future almost certainly has to be in a bullpen, where his stuff does play up.",0
"Signed for $2.35 million as the 18th overall pick in the 2012 Draft, PERSON never tasted adversity on the diamond until he batted .160 in high Class A during the final month of the 2013 season and followed up by hitting .181 in the ORGANIZATION. He made adjustments and rebounded in a huge way in 2014, batting .349/.402/.602 to lead the Minors in hitting and doubles (50), winning ORGANIZATION honors in the high Class A GPE League and sharing the ORGANIZATION' minor league player of the year award with PERSON Pederson.PERSON rivals PERSON (ORGANIZATION) and PERSON (GPE) as the biggest offensive threat among shortstop prospects. PERSON has a smooth, balanced lefty swing as well as bat speed, strength and a mature all-fields approach. He can get a bit aggressive at times but has what it takes to hit for both average and power.Scouts say that PERSON is a more advanced hitter and shows more pop than his older brother PERSON, now an All-Star with the ORGANIZATION, showed at the same stage of his career. Like PERSON, PERSON probably is best suited for third base and could be a strong defender there. While he has the arm and the instincts for shortstop, he's bigger than most players at the position and doesn't have the speed or quickness desired.",1
" PERSON teamed with J.J. PERSON during high school to give PERSON Gardens a formidable one-two punch in the middle of its lineup. He has steadily improved over the past year and should closely follow PERSON on GPE day.  PERSON is a two-way player and will continue to play both ways if he upholds his commitment to GPE. But professional scouts are most interested in him as a hitter. He has a short swing and uses a mature approach at the plate, enabling him to make more contact than most power hitters. He has solid pop, thanks to his strength and leverage in his swing.  PERSON plays first base well and may be athletic enough to handle an outfield corner. He certainly has the arm for it, as his fastball reaches 90 mph on the mound.",0
"PERSON was part of the package PERSON sent to ORGANIZATION in the unscrupulous PERSON deal. His stuff was down just a tad last year, with his fastball more often 93-95 than 94-97 based on our reports from the previous year. But PERSON still has nasty stuff and managed to strike out 133 hitters in 115 innings, mostly at Double-A. His stiff, long arm action significantly inhibits PERSON's ability to throw strikes and he unanimously projects into a bullpen. But because he has three plus pitches (and we have the fastball projected as a 70 out of the bullpen), he could be a dominant late or multi-inning arm. He's one of many new faces on ORGANIZATION's 40-man and could debut in 2019.",0
"It's been a good year to go see talented high school arms in the LOCATION, with ORGANIZATION keeping up with PERSON in GPE and PERSON in GPE as the top prep pitchers in the region.While slightly less projectable than his counterparts, the ORGANIZATION commit performed well this spring. Even though it's just his second full year of pitching, ORGANIZATION is more advanced than many, with more consistent pitchability. He'll pitch at 92-93 mph, but can reach back for 95 mph when he needs it. His curveball shows flashes of being a plus offering, and his changeup gives him the chance to have a very effective three-pitch mix. He can throw all three pitches for strikes .A fresh arm in a durable frame is an intriguing combination. While ORGANIZATION may not have the ceiling of some high school pitchers in this class, his stuff and poise should interest many teams in the first few rounds.",0
"PERSON was a solid two-way performer in high school who hadn't quite grown into his frame yet when he got to PERSON A&M. By the summer after his sophomore year, PERSON was flashing three TrackMan-friendly plus pitches and starter traits in the ORGANIZATION, but he only started 16 games in GPE Station due to a deep veteran staff and his own inconsistency. The ORGANIZATION popped him in the second round in 2017, hoping to tease out the guy they saw on the ORGANIZATION and in the last 18 months, they've done just that. 
PERSON sits in the mid-90s, mixes in a plus slider, with an above average changeup and average command. He still doesn't post the strikeout rates that you'd assume from a possible No. 2 or 3 starter in the ORGANIZATION farm system, which annually leads the minors in strikeouts in part because they know how to coach pitchers to make the most of their stuff. Sources with knowledge in this area indicate that PERSON should see more K's in 2019 if he can make a couple subtle adjustments to how he uses his pitches and fully unlock his potential, which could lead to a big league look at the end of 2019 if the vaunted ORGANIZATION pitching staff has an open spot.",1
"PERSON popped up later in the summer circuit and is a rare linebacker-looking athlete with at least average power and plus speed that can play center field, but there's some questions about contact.",0
"In 2017, PERSON went to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League and threw strikes with a 96-102 mph fastball and plus slider. He struck out 88 hitters in 66 innings. His changeup is still raw, and scouts donât like his stiff, hunched posture during his delivery, but he throws strikes and has a chance to start. He could have an 80 fastball and 70 slider at peak, which alone could make him an elite reliever. If PERSON player development can improve his changeup, or develop a different third pitch, his ceiling as a rotation piece is quite high. He enters his age-22 season in 2018.",0
"PERSON pitched out of GPE's bullpen for most of his college career, but scouts got excited when he took his full repertoire to the rotation as a junior. That turned him into a first-round pick and the ORGANIZATION nabbed him at ORGANIZATION. 19 overall. After struggling a bit in his first full season, the right-hander went back to the ORGANIZATION State League and pitched his way to Double-A in 2018. The ORGANIZATION noticed the rebound and acquired him as part of the package for PERSON and PERSON in December.There hasn't been any issue with PERSON's stuff since he entered pro ball. He'll sit in the 93-95 mph range with his fastball and can reach back for more at times. He does have a pair of breaking balls, with his slider ahead of the curve. He'll throw the harder slider with good late bite and it looked like a plus pitch for him at its best in 2018. PERSON is still working to develop his changeup, though he shows some feel for it. He's made progress in getting left-handed hitters out, using that third pitch more effectively at times.While PERSON's overall command and control have been inconsistent in his brief career, the ORGANIZATION feel they saw a better strike-thrower as he got settled in during his bounce-back 2018 campaign. He is athletic, which should help him repeat his delivery. Staying healthy helped PERSON take a nice step toward his ceiling as a mid-rotation big league starter.",0
" | Overall:4/ 5 The younger brother of GPE outfielder PERSON, PERSON excited scouts with his strong showing in the ORGANIZATION at age 16 in 2011. He missed all of 2012 with a broken ankle but returned strong in 2013 and held his own as an 18-year-old in the ORGANIZATION. He has shown a knack for making contact and a fairly advanced approach, especially given his age. He has the arm and range to stay at shortstop long term. His average speed plays up because of strong instincts. And he looks like he might have more power than you'd expect. PERSON has the chance to become a very good all-around shortstop.",1
"By some measures, PERSON, who got $1.2 million to sign out of high school as a ninth rounder in the 2011 Draft, had a so-so first taste of Double-A. Considering it was his first full season back from PERSON surgery in May 2014, however, it was a success, and the ORGANIZATION added him to the 40-man roster as a result.PERSON is all about his power sinking fastball. He'll throw it in the low 90s and hitters consistently beat it into the ground, proven by his 2.94 groundout-to-airout ratio in 2016. Both of his secondary pitches, a curve and a changeup, have the chance to be PERSON average, and the breaking ball can miss bats at times, but he needs to land it in the strike zone more consistently. PERSON runs into trouble when he tries to be fine in and around the zone. He falls behind in the count when he doesn't need to, leading to him getting hit more, when all he needs to do is go after hitters early with his sinker and create weak contact early in counts.Officially out of rehab mode, PERSON' confidence could be skyrocketing with his addition to the 40-man roster. When he is efficient and challenges hitters, he has the look of an innings-eating, ground-ball machine.",0
"ORGANIZATION's speed and arm strength are fits at shortstop but there's some concern about his frame, ability to hit and even his signability. ",1
"PERSON was drafted because of his athleticism and defensive ability. He has a low-probability bat, but proponents think it will come with physical maturation.",0
"PERSON saw time as a starter and reliever during his three years at ORGANIZATION, but pitched mostly out of the bullpen as a junior. The ORGANIZATION made him their fourth-round pick in 2015, signed him for $488,700 and then deployed him as a starter in his pro debut. He impressed scouts with his pitchability during his promising full-season debut in the LOCATION PERSON and was named a ORGANIZATION State PERSON All-Star in 2017.PERSON's fastball sits at 89-92 mph with good arm-side run, and he can reach back for an extra tick or two when needed. The right-hander's slider, thrown with power and depth in the mid-80s, flashes above average and nets him whiffs, and he understands how to keep hitters off balance with his average curveball. PERSON's fringy changeup is his least-advanced offering, although it stands to improve with increased use as a starter. He has good control, consistently works down in the zone and keeps the ball in the park. PERSON's mature arsenal and pitchability bode well for him becoming a big league starter. Should that not pan out, though, the fastball-slider combo should make him an effective reliever, one capable of working multiple frames.",0
"There are a good number of high school lefties in the 2013 GPE class, and PERSON was one who was rising up to catch up with some of the others who had been closer to the top of GPE boards.The ORGANIZATION product has some serious arm strength, touching 94 mph with his fastball, and there's projection for more in the tank as he matures. He throws a curve and a changeup, and both have the chance to be at least PERSON average pitches in the future, though both are inconsistent right now. So is his command, and he hasn't always maintained his velocity deep into starts.PERSONs' size, arm strength and projectability should keep scouts interested all spring.",0
"Used exclusively as a reliever in his first two college seasons and while dominating the ORGANIZATION last summer -- he allowed one run while striking out 43 in 30 innings and was the co-MVP in the playoffs -- PERSON opened this spring in ORGANIZATION's rotation. He has the requisite three pitches and the durable build to make it as a starter, but he posted a 4.68 ERA in five outings before moving back to the bullpen and becoming the ORGANIZATION' closer. PERSON has a 90-95 mph fastball that plays quicker because he throws it with late life and good downhill plane, though he has yet to prove he can maintain his velocity over long starts. He shows good feel for a sinking changeup and also has a three-quarters breaking ball that varies between a low-80s slider and an upper-70s curveball.PERSON's control and command have improved in each of his seasons at ORGANIZATION. Whichever team drafts him in the first three rounds this June will have to decide whether to develop him as a potential No. 3 or 4 starter or move him quickly as a possible high-leverage reliever.",0
"It doesn't happen often for a college hitter to go through a season hitting over .400 and not be noticed or taken in the GPE. That's because most didn't realize PERSON was a GPE-eligible sophomore at Nevada-Reno until after the GPE. He was playing well for the GPE National Collegiate Team when a bidding war of sorts ensued, won by the ORGANIZATION, who gave him $735,000 to sign. PERSON hit well in the ORGANIZATION (.850 OPS) during his first full season, then fizzled a bit after a promotion to the ORGANIZATION State League.PERSON has a good idea of what he wants to do at the plate, with a contact-oriented approach. He puts the ball in play, sending line drives to the gaps without striking out much and drawing a decent amount of walks. While he's never going to be a huge home run guy, he does have a little sneaky pop and might run into a few homers. His plus speed works on both sides of the ball, allowing him to take an extra base as well as steal a few of them. It also plays well in the outfield. He's seen time in all three outfield spots, but he's better suited in center or left because of his fringy arm.In all likelihood, PERSON will fit the fourth outfielder mold really well. If his bat comes around a little bit more, he could be an everyday outfielder, though it would have to be in center since he doesn't fit the offensive profile for a corner spot.",0
"Better known at ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, Ala.) as a point guard who led his team to the 2011 6-A state basketball championship, PERSON didn't play baseball until his junior year and went undrafted as a prep senior and junior college freshman. He burst onto the prospect scene in 2013, leading PERSON juco players in batting (.495) and on-base percentage (.568), going 17th overall in the draft and signing for $2,164,000. He reached Double-A at the end of his first full pro season and thrived there in 2015, leading the LOCATION in runs (79), hits (160) and steals (49).Though the FACILITY Sox have moved him quickly and he's extremely aggressive at the plate, PERSON's ability to barrel balls has allowed him to hit .301 through his first three pro seasons. His plus-plus speed makes him a huge basestealing threat, but he won't be able to maximize it or hit near the top of a batting order unless he improves his pitch recognition and plate discipline. With his bat speed and wiry strength, he could produce 15 homers per season. Scouts are split on whether PERSON can play shortstop in the big leagues. He has the necessary actions and enough arm strength, but his hands aren't especially soft and his footwork is erratic, leading to 78 errors in his first 255 pro games. His tools would profile well in center field if he can't cut it in the infield.",1
"The gargantuan PERSON was still throwing hard during the spring of 2018, but his stuff appeared to be depressed once the regular season began and he was much more wild than he had been the year before. He was shut down with shoulder inflammation after just six starts, then rehabbed in GPE throughout June before it was determined he'd need surgery to clean up bone spurs in that shoulder, which ended PERSON's season. When healthy, he sits in the mid-90s and has a bevy of average secondary pitches that could be 55s at peak, and he has pleasantly surprising command for his size. PERSON has No. 4 or 5 starter upside, maybe a little more than that if you think his size helps the stuff play as plus, assuming it and the strikes comes back.",0
"A reliever for his first two years at FACILITY in GPE, PERSON moved into the rotation as a junior. The right-hander saw his stock rise considerably as he put up tremendous numbers as a Friday night starter in the ORGANIZATION Association.PERSON fills up the strike zone with four different pitches. He lacks velocity, pitching mostly with an average fastball, though he was up to 93-94 mph in relief stints last summer in the ORGANIZATION. His best pitch is his slider/cutter. It's a plus pitch thrown around 88 mph, but with slider action. Without it, he'd be a fairly pedestrian right-hander, given that his curve is fringy and he doesn't use his changeup much. Because of his pitchability and command, he has the chance to be a back-end starter, a poor man's PERSON. If a team wanted to put him in the bullpen and let him lean on his fastball-cutter combination, he could move quickly through a Minor League system.",1
"GPE is one of the top prep right-handers in the 2017 GPE, and definitely the most traveled. After going from GPE (ORGANIZATION) Heritage as a freshman to ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION) GPE as a sophomore to Prestonwood GPE (GPE, ORGANIZATION) as a junior, he hoped to transfer to GPE (ORGANIZATION) for his final season. When ORGANIZATION' ORGANIZATION nixed that idea, he returned to GPE Heritage and won PERSON's state player of the year award.Scouts aren't sure what to make of the constant transferring, but they don't quibble with his fastball and his frame. His fastball jumped from the high 80s during the summer of 2015 to a consistent 93-95 mph with a peak of 97 a year later, and he has hit 98 and held his velocity deep into games this spring. He attributes the improvement to better conditioning, as his heater took off once he dropped 40 pounds.GPE has one of the best changeups in the high school ranks, throwing it with deceptive arm speed and fade and earning plus grades from some evaluators, but there's still some question about his feel to spin a reliable breaking pitch. The ORGANIZATION A&M recruit doesn't have the most fluid delivery, which sometimes affects his control and leads to some debate over whether he'll be a starter or reliever at the big league level, and he's also one of the oldest high schoolers in this year's crop (19 years, four months on GPE day).",0
"  The ORGANIZATION saw PERSON as an advanced college hitter when they drafted him in 2011. He lived up to his billing, spending his second full professional season in Double-A before being dealt to the ORGANIZATION in November 2013. He missed most of his first year in the ORGANIZATION organization after undergoing surgery on his left foot in April before returning to action in the second half. PERSON has a balanced swing and barrels up the ball well. He's at his best when he's hitting line drives to all fields, but his swing has some loft to it, giving him some pop. After beginning his professional career as a first baseman, PERSON has exclusively played right field in the past two seasons. He's a capable defender there, but it'll be up to his bat to get him to the ORGANIZATION.",0
"GPE's track record of success stacks up well against that of any college pitcher in the 2019 Draft. He swiftly emerged as PERSON's No. 1 starter and led ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION with 111 strikeouts in 96 innings as a freshman in 2017. One of two college hurlers (PERSON's PERSON is the other) to reach triple digits in each of the last three years, he also pitched with the GPE collegiate national team and won the ORGANIZATION all-star game last summer.ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION's 2019 pitcher of the year, GPE usually deals at 90-93 mph and tops out at 96 with his fastball, and his high-three-quarters arm slot creates more downward plane than true life. He has added velocity to his slider, which now arrives in the mid-80s with impressive depth and has become his best pitch. His upper-70s spike curveball has nice downer action as well.Because his breaking pitches have been effective against both left-handers and right-handers, GPE hasn't had to rely on his changeup much at the college level. He has an unorthodox delivery with a lot of effort, leading to some questions about his suitability as a long-term starter in pro ball. But he makes it work and hasn't had any difficulty controlling his pitches, so he'll get every opportunity to stick in a rotation.",0
"In 2008, PERSON became the first black LOCATION to sign a professional baseball contract. He has steadily progressed through the ORGANIZATION and developed into a prospect. PERSON is an excellent defender at shortstop with soft hands and a strong arm. His bat, however, is still a work in progress. PERSON has quick hands and a good approach at the plate, but still struck out 131 times at high Class A ORGANIZATION last year. He is a plus runner and is a threat on the base paths. PERSON's defense will allow the ORGANIZATION to be patient as he develops offensively.",0
"PERSON is extremely polished for his age, in large part because he grew up around the game as the son of Dodgers scout PERSON. PERSON tore the ORGANIZATION in his right knee in March 2012, four months before he became eligible to sign, but that didn't stop GPE from inking him for $575,000. Sent to the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League at age 17, PERSON had a solid debut last summer, despite being one of the youngest regulars in the league.PERSON has the bat speed and already-mature approach to hit for average, and he could have double-digit home run power as he gets stronger. PERSON can get off balance at the plate from time to time, but that's a correctable flaw.While PERSON isn't as fast as he was prior to knee surgery, he still has average speed, and he knows what he's doing on the bases. PERSON's instincts shine as well on defense, where he has sure hands, but he lacks the arm strength to play on the left side of the diamond.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 4, 2017 - PERSON, ORGANIZATIONif.Favorite MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON Jr.PERSON has made three All-Tournament teams since 2015, including the 2016 16U PG World Series, and was rewarded with a 2016 ORGANIZATION. He was selected to play on the 2016 U17 USA Baseball National Team Development Program as a member of ORGANIZATION, which swept PERSON in four straight games. The catcher also participated in the ORGANIZATION All-American Games and the 2017 ORGANIZATION. A ORGANIZATION State PERSON commit, PERSON has a good feel for the barrel at the plate. He has average power, enough bat speed to handle plus fastballs and his swing has rhythm. Overall, he looks to use the middle and pull side of the field with the bat in his hands.As a backstop, PERSON has sound receiving skills and average arm strength. He also looks the part, with a medium frame and a solid build.",0
"A very likely big league role player with limited ceiling, PERSON is a twitchy, multi-positional infielder with good hands/actions. He's a switch-hitter with good feel for contact from both sides of the plate, and he also runs well, so there are all kinds of scenarios where his skillset would be useful throughout a game. But PERSON's total lack of power will probably be a barrier to an everyday role.",0
"PERSON made his GPE debut a very successful one in 2012, pitching well in both the ORGANIZATION and GPE. The right-hander has a fastball that can run up to 96 mph with good sink and he does a good job of keeping it down in the strike zone. He complements that with an above-average changeup. His breaking ball is developing and looks more like a slider than a breaking ball right now. While he's not gigantic, he's physical enough where his size isn't a concern. He'll spend all of 2013 at age 18, so it will be interesting to see how cautious the ORGANIZATION are with his development.",0
"The D-backs signed PERSON out of the ORGANIZATION during the 2012 signing period, then had him skip over the ORGANIZATION to make his pro debut in the GPE before he turned 17. A move to full-season ball to start the 2015 season didn't go well, but he hit the reset button in the LOCATION last summer and worked his way back up to the ORGANIZATION in the middle of 2016.There are no questions about PERSON's defensive work. He will stay at shortstop long-term, with as strong of an arm as anyone in the system, an absolute rifle, though he's also seen some time at second and a little at third. His other defensive skills are well above-average, with outstanding hands and excellent range, even though he's just an average runner. PERSON still needs to add strength to become an offensive contributor. He has a solid approach and will draw walks, but there is no power to speak of. The hope is he'll mature enough to shoot balls to the gaps.Even with the false start in 2015, PERSON is still ahead of the curve in terms of age for his level. And even if it takes a while for the bat to come around, he has the chance to be a defensive-oriented regular at a premium position.",0
"The ORGANIZATION aren't afraid to buck the industry consensus in the GPE, and they did so by spending the 25th overall pick in the 2013 GPE and a $1,866,500 bonus to land PERSON. He won ORGANIZATION honors in the Rookie-level PERSON in his debut, then shook off a rough first month in low Class A and a thumb injury to finish second in the short-season LOCATION batting race (.333) in 2014.An accomplished amateur hitter who was named ORGANIZATION as the 18-and-under world championships in 2012, PERSON has tremendous hand-eye coordination and understands the strike zone, allowing him to repeatedly barrel balls. He's more of a pure hitter than a slugger, though he has enough bat speed to produce 15 homers per season. PERSON has just fringy speed and average athleticism, so most scouts outside the organization give him no chance to stay at shortstop. PERSON thinks he has underrated quickness and a chance to stick there. He probably profiles best as a third baseman and has the solid arm strength for the hot corner.",1
" When PERSON was taken by the ORGANIZATION out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks in 2009, it was as a bat-first catcher, one who hadn't spent that much time behind the plate. By the time they sent him to the Phillies in the ORGANIZATION deal in July 2012, there were no longer as many questions about his ability to stay behind the plate. PERSON has an excellent arm that has allowed him to throw out 37 percent of would-be basestealers in his career. He moves and blocks fairly well, though there's room for improvement there. At the plate, he has very good raw power and can drive the ball to all fields, though there have been some issues with his setup, including wrapping his bat, that haven't allowed him to be as consistent as he has the potential to be. Throughout 2013, PERSON struggled with the effects of a concussion, which eventually forced his season to come to an end in early August.Bernie Pleskoff's scouting report Â»",0
"Many of the teenage prospects on this list received big bonuses or were flagged after a season in the ORGANIZATION as a prospect to watch; it's unsurprising when those types move up this list. ORGANIZATION wasn't one of those. He didn't appear on last year's list, which had 65 players in total -- he wasn't even in the Others of GPE section. ORGANIZATION sits at 90-92 mph with an above average, flashing curveball, but was still in the early stages of knowing how to use those weapons while pitching in the ORGANIZATION and ORGANIZATION in 2017. We first heard his name when he was wowing pro scouts who saw him in GPE last summer. The first scout we spoke with said ORGANIZATION had a ORGANIZATION starter kit, flashing two plus pitches and a starter's delivery, though the changeup and command were understandably a bit behind. Those things progressed throughout the summer and he got a taste of Low-A at the end of the year. ORGANIZATION officials love ORGANIZATION' makeup and competitive fire, and think he's got a chance to be the 200-inning starter who comes out of this system, as the other pitchers on the list have one or more of the typical concerns (durability, command, arm surgery, less experience, or a standout pitch that fits best in relief). ORGANIZATION could grab a spot in next year's Top 100 with a full healthy season of performance like his breakout 2018 campaign.",0
"PERSON is very polished for a prep pitcher, and it showed when he spun three consecutive no-hitters in March and April, three shy of the national high school record. He may not get drafted high enough to lure him away from a commitment to GPE, where he could make an immediate impact as a freshman.PERSON's pitchability stands out more than his pure stuff, though he does have a pair of solid pitches in his fastball and slider. He works from 87-91 mph with his heater, which features some riding life, and he can throw his slider for strikes or use it as a chase pitch. His changeup will need more work.He's a good athlete who does a nice job of repeating his easy, balanced delivery, though scouts wonder how much more velocity PERSON has in the tank. He's not extremely physical and lacks standout arm speed. Should he attend college, he'll be Draft-eligible as a sophomore in 2018.",0
"He didn't make the rounds on the showcase circuit last summer, so the arm speed and projectablity that PERSON displayed at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in October were somewhat of a revelation. While he won't be the first GPE high school pitcher drafted, he's the best athlete in that crop and could creep into the first three rounds for a club that believes in his ceiling.PERSON's fastball has added significant velocity in the last year and now sits in the low 90s while topping out at 96 mph with some run and sink. Considering that his arm is so quick and clean and he has the room to add plenty of strength to his 6-foot-4 frame, he could work in the mid-90s once he's a finished product. The GPE recruit uses a high-three-quarters delivery to create downhill plane that makes his heater even tougher to hit.PERSON is showing improvement with his slider, which can be a solid pitch in the low 80s with some depth at its best. He hasn't used his changeup much and will need to refine it to have another option against more advanced hitters. He's still in the early stages of his development, but he's so projectable and young (he won't turn 18 until nearly two months after the GPE) that his upside is intriguing.",0
"Every ORGANIZATION class has its fair share of college performers -- guys who put up good numbers without much fanfare.Peterson had a monstrous sophomore season at ORGANIZATION, then led PERSON in home runs and ORGANIZATION over the summer. He's an advanced hitter with plus power, one who's not afraid to take a walk. He's played both corners defensively, mostly playing first while with ORGANIZATION Baseball.Good college hitters with pop tend to move up as the ORGANIZATION approaches, and a repeat performance from his sophomore year should land him near the top of the first round. Some scouts felt he was the best pure hitter, especially in the college ranks, in the entire class.",0
"Last year, PERSON shuttled back and forth between Double-A (which he crushed) and Triple-A (which he did not) while with the ORGANIZATION, then was sent to GPE Francisco at the end of August as part of the ORGANIZATION trade. He has rare power for a viable defensive shortstop but hits the ball on the ground so much that it's highly unlikely he does much in-game damage with the bat unless his swing is overhauled. And while solid at short, PERSON's not so good that you'd live with zero offense and play him everyday. He'll likely be a glove-first utility guy, but he hasn't played much second or third base yet and he's already 24.",1
GPE has moved to the bullpen and upped the usage of his mid-90s fastball and above-average slider. He's a big league-ready relief piece.,1
"GPE ORGANIZATION typically has a flush crop of high school pitching to consider every Draft year. The Class of 2016 is no different and while PERSON isn't the prototypical tall and projectable right-hander, his stuff has made scouts sit up and take notice.Just because PERSON isn't as big as some of the prep arms near the top of this list, that doesn't mean he lacks upside potential. He has seen his velocity spike this spring, firing his fastball up to 93 mph at times. He backs it up with a solid average curveball. Like with many high schoolers, PERSON's changeup is his third pitch. He has shown some polish and a repeatable delivery, with the hope that his feel for pitching should allow him to develop that third pitch. PERSON has been inconsistent with his fastball at times over the course of the spring, but there is room for him to add strength and he should be able to maintain velocity in the future.PERSON threw fairly well down the stretch, giving him a little boost. His stuff might have a ways to go, but his clean delivery and projectability has moved him solidly into top three round consideration.",0
"The Friday night starter for the ORGANIZATION of GPE as a junior, PERSON has a track record of success as a three-year member of the rotation. He could potentially stay in that role or get to the big leagues in a hurry coming out of the bullpen.PERSON really knows how to pitch, with a four-pitch mix he uses extremely well. He'll pitch with a fastball a tick above-average in the future with heavy sink, throwing it now in the 89-94 mph range. He adds and subtracts from it at will. PERSON has two usable breaking balls, a solid average slider and an average curveball, as well as an average changeup, and he commands all four of them well. PERSON does all of this from a low three-quarter arm slot, with a kind of PERSON Cishek-like delivery. With a bulldog mentality, PERSON could rush to the big leagues in a relief role, though his feel for pitching does give him the chance to be a back-end starter.",0
"GPE's high school PERSON in 2015, PERSON considered playing two sports in college before deciding to concentrate on baseball at ORGANIZATION, where he pitched just 7 1/3 innings as a freshman. He transferred to FACILITY to get more playing time and immediately generated early-round Draft buzz during fall practice. Despite going through a dead-arm period in the spring, he surpassed PERSON (eighth round, 2014) as the highest pick in the juco power's history and signed for $557,500 as a third-rounder.Before he tired and had a minor lat injury, PERSON pitched with a lively 92-95 mph fastball that reached 97. He sat more around 91-93 mph as the ORGANIZATION limited him to no more than five innings per start in his pro debut, though his heavy sink still produced an impressive 2.4 groundout/airout ratio. An 82-85 mph slider was his best pitch at times at FACILITY, though he falls in love with at times and it wasn't as hard or sharp last summer. PERSON will have to use his changeup more than he did as an amateur, and though it's currently too firm it does feature some tumble. He's still figuring out his control and command because he's relatively inexperienced for his age, but his athleticism helps him repeat his delivery. His size creates angle and deception, adding to what might be a No. 3 starter package if he's durable.",0
"The ORGANIZATION of GPE has had three players taken in the top three rounds of the regular June Draft in its history, none of whom have played a game in the big leagues. The most recent is 2013 first-rounder D.J.

But his future is undoubtedly in the outfield, where he has the athleticism to stay in center field for a while. He has a tick above-average speed, sometimes showing plus, with very good range in the outfield and an average arm to go with it. His defense plays up because of his instincts. He's hit for average throughout his college career and has more walks than strikeouts, with a firm understanding that his job is to get on base. There is some pull power there, though it's not a huge part of his game. PERSON gets high marks for his makeup and competitiveness on the field.Scouts do pause a bit because of the lack of success of GPE hitters at the next level. But PERSON has the skill set that should translate to being a good fourth outfielder on a championship-caliber team or an everyday center fielder in other lineups, with a comp to big league outfielder PERSON.",0
"The ORGANIZATION made PERSON a sixth-rounder in 2012, one year after his brother, GPE, went in the seventh round to the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION quickly made the younger PERSON a second baseman, where his range and arm will likely make him a solid defender. At the plate, PERSON has an advanced approach and consistently barrels up balls. He doesn't have much power and he gets the most out of his average speed. Some scouts believe PERSON has a higher ceiling than his older brother. He began his first full-professional season in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"The ORGANIZATION spent lavishly during the 2015-16 international signing period, paying more than $150 million in signing bonuses, guaranteed salaries and tax penalties for blowing past their bonus-pool limitations. Their final move on that front was to sign PERSON, a GPE defector, for a $2 million bonus and matching penalty in mid-June. Six weeks later, they traded him to the PERSON for PERSON Fields.PERSON batted .351 with limited power in 40 games in GPE's top league as a 17-year-old in 2014. He has begun to physically mature and now carries 225 pounds on his 6-foot-5 frame. His left-handed power potential is his most enticing tool, and the ORGANIZATION and PERSON also were encouraged by his feel for hitting.Most of PERSON's value will come from his bat. He's a fringy runner limited to first base or left field, though he does have a decent arm.",1
"PERSON entered the 2012 season as a candidate to go No. 1 overall in the draft, but a slump dropped him to the ORGANIZATION at the 24th pick. As a rare college shortstop talented enough to play there in the big leagues, he commanded a $2.05 million bonus. He has played as advertised in pro ball, shining with his glove while showing inconsistency with his bat.PERSON has all the tools and instincts necessary to win a ORGANIZATION at shortstop. He has smooth actions, reads balls off the bat well, has range to both sides and can make any throw from any angle. He's reliable, too, making just 27 errors in 249 games during his first three pro seasons.His bat remains a question mark after PERSON followed a .291/.371/.433 first half in Double-A last year by hitting .210/.260/.285 in Triple-A. While he'll probably hit at the bottom of a big league batting order, he does have some wiry strength for gap power and the patience to draw a few walks. He's a savvy baserunner with average speed.",0
"GSP has dominated professional hitters since the ORGANIZATION took him 38th overall in 2010. He was a key piece of the deal that sent ORGANIZATION to GPE in December 2012, and he started the ORGANIZATION for the GPE team the next summer. ORGANIZATION uses his height well, throwing downhill with some movement. Though his fastball is plus, thrown up to 96 mph consistently, he's more than just a thrower. His power curve has improved as he's added velocity to it, and it could be an above-average breaking ball in the future. He has a power changeup as well, which is still a work in progress but could give him a third above-average offering. Despite his size, he has an easy delivery and he throws strikes. His combination of stuff, pitchability and aggressiveness on the mound point to a future as a frontline starter.",1
" If you wanted to build a prototype of what a big, strong, projectable pitching prospect should look like, starting with PERSON might not be a bad idea. The ORGANIZATION had aggressively stockpiled young arms via the Draft in recent years. Some of them were used as trading chips, but PERSON remains, and for good reason. His pure stuff is outstanding, with a plus fastball and an outstanding curve to give him as good a one-two punch as any pitching prospect. His changeup projects to be at least an average offering. He throws downhill and there's room for him to add some strength. PERSON needs to cut down on his walk rate to succeed as he moves up, but he has all the makings of a frontline starter if that happens as the ORGANIZATION start to take the kid gloves off.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"The son of former ORGANIZATION defensive lineman PERSON, PERSON also has a football build that has prompted physical comparisons to seven-time All-Star PERSON. He opened last summer as the consensus top high school pitching prospect before getting passed by fellow GPE product PERSON. PERSON has passed them both among PERSON prepsters this spring, and while PERSON won't be the first prep arm selected, he still could fit somewhere in the back half of the first round.PERSON usually pitches at 92-96 mph with his fastball and can reach 98, showing hard sink on occasion and generally commanding it well. There are times when his heater gets hit harder than expected, usually when it straightens out and he leaves it up in the zone. His shoulder opens early at times, giving batters a good look at his fastball, but he's athletic enough to adjust his delivery and hide the ball better.PERSON generates power with a quick arm and little effort, something that's also evident when he snaps off a wipeout slider in the mid-80s. It needs more consistency, as does a changeup that should become at least average, but he has all the makings of a quality three-pitch repertoire. He's part of a loaded ORGANIZATION recruiting class that also includes PERSON.",0
"It appears PERSON is all the way back after undergoing PERSON surgery in August 2011. He proved his health this spring as PERSON's Friday starter, pitching well enough to convince the ORGANIZATION to select him with the 31st overall pick. PERSON has a lively fastball that he'll throw up to 95 mph and command well, working quickly and getting many ground-ball outs. His secondary stuff -- a slider and a changeup -- isn't quite as good as his fastball, though both have the chance to develop into consistently PERSON average offerings. The ORGANIZATION have moved top college starters (such as PERSON and PERSON) quickly in the past and with his three-pitch mix and some decent pitchabilitiy, PERSON could find himself on a similarly aggressive track toward the ORGANIZATION.",0
"The PERSON made PERSON their eighth-round pick in June 2015, and then gave him $400,000 to forgo his commitment to PERSON A&M. PERSON's dominance as an amateur carried over to his professional debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, and he built on that performance last year during his full-season debut in 2016. The ORGANIZATION acquired the right-hander from PERSON on June 30 -- while in the midst of a stretch that saw him toss three straight hitless outings of five innings --- only to have to shut him down with a forearm strain that required PERSON surgery in August.When healthy, PERSON has an impressive combination of stuff and feel. An uptick in velocity in 2015 pushed his fastball into the 92-94 mph range in his pro debut, and he's adept at locating it to both sides of the plate. PERSON's changeup is a double-plus pitch and easily his best secondary offering, thrown with convincing arm action and outstanding tumble. He also made strides with his breaking ball in 2016, throwing it with greater depth and sharper bite, giving him a promising arsenal of three average-or-better pitches. The right-hander uses his height to create good plane toward the plate, and it's only going to improve as he adds strength and gains better control of his core.PERSON still has room to grow into his highly projectable frame, and some evaluators believe his fastball will sit in the mid 90s once he's fully developed. He will need to refine his command and develop an effective breaking ball, but he shows the early makings of a potential No. 3 or 4 starter.",1
"PERSON took a huge step forward last spring, first by adding strength to his already physical frame, and then with a breakout sophomore campaign during which he went 12-1 and posted a 1.22 ORGANIZATION in 13 starts with 117 strikeouts in 103 innings, ranking among the national junior college leaders in wins, ORGANIZATION and whiffs. Viewed by scouts as the top junior college prospect in the 2016 Draft, PERSON became the second-highest drafted player in GPE A. Logan (Ill.) CC history when the ORGANIZATION selected him in the second round.A big, physical right-hander with a three-quarters delivery, PERSON pitches at 91-94 mph with his fastball but can reach back for more, all the while using his size to create good angle to the plate. His slider has gotten harder and sharper, showing flashes of becoming an above-average pitch, and he'll also mix in a curveball and changeup, though neither pitch is particularly advanced.PERSON was a solid strike-thrower in college but has had trouble pounding the zone consistently since entering the professional ranks. He possesses the requisite size and durability but will need to improve the command of his fastball, as well as the consistency of his secondary pitches, to make it as a big league starter. If he can't, he has promise as a late-inning reliever.",0
"The 2013 Draft class had some depth in terms of high school left-handers and it was PERSON, the southpaw out of GPE, who was the second from that crop to be taken in the first round. While he's not the biggest guy in the world, leading some to wonder about his durability, few have questions about his stuff. He can crank his fastball up to 95 mph and his hard breaking ball gives him a second potentially plus pitch. He has a feel for his changeup, though he didn't use it much in high school, and he gets high marks for his poise and pitchability. As a high schooler from the LOCATION, it might be easy to think it could take PERSON a bit longer to get to the highest level, but it shouldn't' surprise anyone if he shortens the learning curve.",0
"PERSON pitched to a 1.37 ERA over 21 appearances out of GPE's bullpen as a true freshman and was off to a strong start in 2016 before undergoing PERSON surgery. After making a healthy return and turning another strong relief campaign as a redshirt sophomore, PERSON was moved into the ORGANIZATION' rotation in 2018 and excelled in the new role, going 7-3 with a 2.19 ERA in 16 starts en route to GPE Athletic Conference pitcher of the year honors. The ORGANIZATION took him in the 14th round that June and used him as a swingman in his pro debut before shifting PERSON back to a full-time bullpen role for his first full season. It proved a wise decision, as he quickly climbed three levels, reaching the Double-A ORGANIZATION in mid-July before he was sent to the ORGANIZATION in return for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION Deadline.PERSON is capable of bumping 94-95 mph with his fastball but usually sits more in the low-90s, with the pitch playing on account of some funk in his delivery and because he hides the ball well on the backside. His slider is his lone above-average secondary pitch and makes him lethal on same-sided hitters, but he also has a good changeup that he uses to neutralize righties. He can throw strikes and miss bats with all three pitches, and hitters generally have trouble squaring him up. PERSON has been particularly effective against left-handed hitters early in his career thanks to his combination of stuff and deception, but he also shown that he can get outs on both sides of the plate while consistently inducing weak contact. Those traits suggest that he could be more than simply a situational left-hander out of the 'pen, although a ORGANIZATION role likely represents his clearest path to the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON parlayed a strong career as a starter at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, including a championship in his sophomore year, into becoming a second round pick in the 2016 Draft. Thought to be a quick-to-the-big leagues college performer, things didn't go quite as planned, though he did lead the ORGANIZATION in groundout-to-airout ratio and had the best ground ball ratio of any pitcher in baseball, including the big leagues.PERSON has plenty of fastball, typically in the low-90s, but it plays up move because of his plus plus sink and his ability to get outs early in counts as a result. He does have usable secondary weapons and understands how to pitch soft, but doesn't always use it effectively. His slider is ahead of his curve, and he has good feel for a changeup, but trusting all of it has been an issue. He's smoothed out his delivery somewhat since his college days, but is still working to repeat it consistently. That's led to more control issues than anticipated, with a 3.9 BB/9 rate in his first full season.With the potential to have a usable three or four-pitch mix, PERSON still has the chance to be a back-end starter. If it doesn't come together, his sinker-slider combination could look awfully good coming out of the bullpen.",0
"Pitchers out of small schools taken in the 16th round of a Draft aren't typically expected to do much, and they're certainly not thought to be quick movers through a system. PERSON had an up-and-down final season at ORGANIZATION II Cal Poly and showed fringy stuff during his summer debut. But he took a big leap forward in his first full season in 2018 and shot all the way to Double-A.PERSON will flash three plus pitches at times, with his fastball, breaking ball and changeup. While he was 87-90 mph during his first summer, he's been 93-95 mph from the left side consistently out of the bullpen in 2018. Most will call his breaking ball a slider, though some see it as a hard curve, thrown in the mid-80s, that can miss bats. His changeup can also be an out pitch for him.With three quality offerings, it might be thought PERSON could start, but a lack of command, particularly with his fastball, to go along with an uptempo, aggressive delivery, make a relief role perfect for him. If he can find the strike zone a bit more consistently, he'll be ready to help out a big league bullpen fairly soon.",0
" PERSON, a native of GPE, was one of the top amateur free agents to sign out of GPE in 2013. He had been a prominent player for a few years and was named to the all-tournament team at the 2011 16U World Championship, when he led GPE with a .414 batting average and .690 slugging percentage.  PERSON doesn't have any one tool that stands out but earns praise for his all-around play. A switch-hitter, he hits well from both sides of the plate and exhibits a good feel for the barrel. His swing is more geared for hitting line drives, but he does have some power.  PERSON was signed as a shortstop, but he also played third base during his professional debut in the ORGANIZATION. The Indians still see him as a shortstop, where he has solid range and an average arm.",1
"The ORGANIZATION paid seven-figure bonuses to three high school arms in the middle rounds of the 2014 Draft, including $1 million for PERSON in the fifth round. The earliest Mississippi prep pitcher drafted since PERSON (ORGANIZATION, second round) in 1999, he didn't reach full-season ball until his third year as a pro and struggled with his mechanics when he got there in 2016. He has cleaned up his delivery and looked much better while making the jump to high Class A at age 21 in 2017.PERSON's best pitch is his fastball, which resides at 91-92 mph, tops out at 95 and creates groundouts thanks to its sink and run. He's gaining more consistency with his curveball, which has good depth and misses bats when at its best. His fading changeup has its moments as well.PERSON is beginning to make the transition from thrower to pitcher. He still needs to improve his control and command but he's making progress in both areas. He's not very physical but he's athletic, giving hope that he eventually can develop into a No. 3 or 4 starter.",0
"Signed for just over $2 million late during the summer of 2016, BolaÃ±os is a pretty standard fifth starter/middle relief prospect. His changeup and command both need to improve if he's going to be a clean rotation fit, but if they don't, his fastball (which lives 91-95 as a starter, but would hopefully tick up out of the bullpen) and slurvy breaking ball are typical of solid middle relievers. He's repeating Hi-A and will likely be developed as a starter for a while yet, at least until he's closer to when he needs to be added to the 40-man, two Novembers from now.",0
"Though GPE (GPE) PERSON has sent more than two dozen players to college programs, it never has had a player drafted before the 20th round. That should change in 2018, as the ORGANIZATION have a pair of potential first-rounders in GPE and right-hander PERSON. GPE is one of the better all-around hitters in the prep class and doesn't have a glaring weakness.GPE has a quick right-handed stroke and has a track record of catching up to and punishing quality fastballs on the showcase circuit. With his strength, balance and mature approach, he makes consistent hard line-drive contact. Once he fills out his rangy 6-foot-4 frame and adds some loft to his swing, he could have plus power.An average runner out of the batter's box and quicker once he gets going, GPE is athletic for his size but won't stay at shortstop after he leaves GPE. His solid arm will play anywhere in the infield, where he probably fits best at third base but may have a chance to stick up the middle at second, and he has the makeup to get the most out of his ability. If he attends college, he'll reunite with his brother PERSON at ORGANIZATION.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have produced some very good relievers in recent years and PERSON appears to be the next in line. After two years throwing in lower-profile roles, the right-hander took over the closer's role in 2016 and ran with it.PERSON is similar to former GPE reliever PERSON in terms of his loose, wiry body and quick arm, though some scouts feel PERSON's delivery is better than that of GPE, who ended up a fifth-round pick of the Twins in 2014. He throws his fastball in the 93-94 mph range. He complements the fastball with a frisbee slider, one that does have some depth and bite to it at times. He pounds the strike zone and pitches with good tempo.PERSON's stuff is a little short for him to continue closing games, even if he reached double-digits in saves this season with GPE. His ceiling is that of a setup man at the highest level, with the potential to be a middle reliever a distinct possibility.",0
"The best prospect in baseball, PERSON hit a superhuman .381/.437/.636 across 95 games (mostly at ORGANIZATION and Triple-A) despite being about six years younger than the other athletes in the LOCATION and ORGANIZATION. The ball doesn't just sound different off of his bat; when he really lays into one, you can feel a thump inside your chest as if someone set off a firework at home plate. Itâs explosive, beautiful, and paradoxically violent considering that PERSON is so childlike in his shape and demeanor. He plays with a vivacious enthusiasm, totally unashamed of his own at times bizarre mannerisms, as if the way he feels when playing elite pro baseball is how most of us did with a wiffle ball in our hands during adolescence. (ORGANIZATION during ORGANIZATION, he was cranky and petulant with umpires.) 
But his is not a childlike stature. His listed 6-foot-1, 200 pounds is a farce, and on the few occasions that PERSON and PERSON (who is listed at 6-foot-3, 245) were standing near one another during ORGANIZATION, PERSON was clearly the larger human being. While he reaches an almost shocking top speed on the bases given his size, PERSON does have lateral mobility issues that impact his range at third base. He is very likely to move to first base or DH at some point in his early 20s, but leaving him at third, even if he's not very good there, might help motivate him to keep his weight in check for as long as possible, something that could be more important than the quality of his play in the field since PERSON had knee issues during the 2018 season. 
PERSON though, it matters very little where he ends up playing. This is the best hitter in the minors and the stick will play anywhere. For at least two years now people around baseball, including the late Mel Didier, swore that PERSON would be ready for and competing in the majors before he turned 20. PERSON's desire to maintain control of his talent for as long as possible scuttled that notion late last summer when they chose not to promote him, and PERSON will turn 20 in March before this season even starts. He should be up early this year, and immediately become one of the game's most exciting, productive hitters. He is the cornerstone of the ORGANIZATION franchise, and perhaps a cornerstone of our sport.",1
"The ORGANIZATION blew past their international signing pool in 2014 with headline prospect SS PERSON getting the bulk of their pool ($2.95 million bonus) and some called Rondon the top prospect in the class, while the ORGANIZATION insisted that PERSON ($400,000 bonus) was much closer in talent than their bonuses and reputation would indicate. Today, PERSON is the clearly superior prospect and one of the top five in his singing class due to his quick-developing plus raw power and advanced feel to get to his power in games without excessive swing and miss. He's also deceptively quick and instinctive in the outfield, with a nonzero chance of playing center field at the upper levels, but likely settling in as an above average right fielder.",0
"In his first two years of college, PERSON had more success in summer ball than he did at PERSON. He redshirted in his first season with the ORGANIZATION and played sparingly in 2015, but he earned all-star honors in the ORGANIZATION and PERSON leagues. He led the Cape with 15.6 plate appearances per strikeout and finished eighth in the batting race at .315 last summer, and he has recorded similar numbers as PERSON's everyday third baseman this spring.PERSON has good feel for hitting and rarely swings and misses. The downside is that he makes contact so easily that he draws few walks, so his batting average will be more impressive than his on-base percentage. While he homered just once in 34 games with wood bats on the Cape last year, leading to some concerns about his power, he has driven the ball consistently as a redshirt sophomore.PERSON has below-average speed but has worked hard on his conditioning and his quickness at third base. He's a decent defender with good hands and an average arm, though he could be in trouble if he doesn't have the pop to profile at the hot corner. He doesn't have the tools for second base and the offensive demands would be even greater in left field.",0
"This is a very physical teenager with some of the best present raw power in his signing class and a good chance to play a premium defensive position at catcher. PERSON has a strong, physically mature build that inspires PERSON comparisons. He has excellent lateral mobility despite his size, and his receiving was alright, but not great, when he caught pro-quality stuff at showcases. 
He checks all the other beloved catcher skillset boxes: PERSON is poised and engaged with his pitchers, he has a great arm, he looks built to meet the position's physical demands, and makes an attempt to frame pitches when he can. There's a chance he outgrows the position but he's deceptively athletic for his size, and we'd call it unlikely. There's not as much room for power projection here as there is for most others this age, but there's enough to profile at catcher. PERSON's approach is geared for well-timed, pull-side gap contact. He's a potential regular who'll likely spend his first pro season in GPE, as he's too physical for the ORGANIZATION.",0
"A third baseman at the start of his college career at FACILITY, GPE moved behind the plate after a strong freshman season. The ORGANIZATION, with a strong track record of finding college talent in the later rounds, nabbed GPE in the seventh round of the 2016 Draft, and he promptly double-jumped from A ball to Double-A over the course of his first full season. He then capped things off with a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION League.In his short time as a pro, GPE has shown a knack for barreling up the baseball, making consistent hard contact to all fields. An aggressive hitter from the right side of the plate, he doesn't walk much, but he also doesn't strike out. His power will be the last tool to come for him, but he's already showing some over-the-fence pop. While his arm strength is solid average, it plays up because he's accurate, and he threw out 45 percent of would-be basestealers in 2017. He has solid average hands and he's continuing to learn the nuances of game-calling.GPE didn't disappoint in handling the challenge of the double-jump to Double-A while still learning his craft as a backstop, seriously upgrading his prospect profile. The ORGANIZATION have a good problem on their hands with two potential big league regulars in GPE and PERSON at the top of the system.",1
"GPE of the ORGANIZATION Dempster trade with the ORGANIZATION in mid-2012, PERSON excelled in his first full season in the ORGANIZATION organization. He led the Double-A LOCATION with 41 doubles, 62 extra-base hits and 230 total bases, helping his cause in a crowded GPE third-base picture. But he has regressed in 2014, struggling in his first Triple-A exposure and not performing much better after returning to Double-A.PERSON never has exhibited the smoothest swing or a lot of patience at the plate, but he always made plenty of hard contact in the past. That has happened less frequently this year as he has gotten himself out too frequently by chasing pitches out of the strike zone. The best-case scenario for him is that he could be a .250 hitter with 18-20 homers per season in the big leagues.A potential ORGANIZATION, PERSON exhibits outstanding body control at third base. His hands, arm and footwork are also assets. But his defense won't matter if he can't perform better at the plate, and even if he does, he won't dislodge PERSON as the ORGANIZATION' third baseman of the future.",0
"GPE's velo was on the rise just before the draft, averaging just over 90 for the first time in his career, but in the postseason was back to 87-91 when he had to rely more on finesse.",0
"The ORGANIZATION forfeited their 2015 first-round pick to sign free agent PERSON and sent their supplemental first-rounder to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION trade. When PERSON made its first choice at ORGANIZATION. 51 overall, it was thrilled to find that PERSON was still available. He's a part of the same ORGANIZATION Community High (PERSON, Fla.) program that produced 2014 ORGANIZATION first-rounder PERSON, who's now with the Nationals.Signed for $1.2 million, PERSON had some of the easiest velocity among high school pitchers in the 2015 Draft. He usually deals at 90-92 mph and tops out at 96 while expending little more effort than if he were just playing catch. Once he adds strength to his 6-foot-4 frame, he could have a consistent mid-90s fastball.PERSON's secondary pitches need more consistency yet show promise. His curveball has power and depth and his changeup features fade and deception. His delivery and athleticism bode well for his ability to fill the strike zone.",0
"The ORGANIZATION signed the identical PERSON twins for $450,000 each out of GPE in 2012 and traded them four years later, shipping infielder PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in a July deal for PERSON and PERSON to the FACILITY as part of the ORGANIZATION blockbuster in December. Overshadowed in the ORGANIZATION trade package by PERSON and PERSON, PERSON has considerable upside of his own as a switch-hitting center fielder with five-tool potential. An injury to his left knee hampered him in his first season with his new organization and led to surgery to repair a torn meniscus, but he has impressed once healthy again in 2018 and homered off a 102-mph fastball from the ORGANIZATION' PERSON in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON Game.PERSON is still very much a work in progress offensively because his stroke gets long and he's still learning to recognize pitches and control the strike zone. He has impressive bat speed and strength in his hands and wrists, and GPE hopes to unlock his raw power by getting him to take a more direct path to the ball. With his plus speed and basestealing acumen, he could be a 20-20 player if he improves as a hitter.PERSON has the tools to play anywhere in the outfield. PERSON briefly pushed him to right field when they were teammates at short-season PERSON in GPE's system, but he otherwise has been a center fielder. He has solid range and a plus arm in center.",0
"An effective three-year college starting pitcher at GPE taken in the fifth round of the 2015 Draft, PERSON found his home in the ORGANIZATION system as a reliever and racked up 64 saves in his first three years. But in 2018 at ORGANIZATION, he was employed mainly in a set-up role, pitching well enough to earn a spot on the 40-man roster.PERSON has an often deceptive three-quarters delivery that enables him to hide the ball well. Able to throw up to 97 mph, he can also keep hitters guessing by changing arm angles and tempo or shortening his stride. Unless he develops his below-average and seldom-used changeup, he could have time managing left-handed hitters in the big leagues. He could temper that with by burying a backdoor slider in on lefties.While he certainly has the mentality to be a big-league closer with a delivery not unlike PERSON or PERSON, his stuff projects as a likely better fit as a middle reliever or right-handed matchup specialist. PERSON doesn't walk a lot of batters nor he is victimized much by the long ball, and he is capable of racking up strikeouts.",0
"A two-sport star in high school, PERSON kind of got lost amid the many talented prep arms in the 2018 class, but he was in the second tier, wire-to-wire, for the clubs that emphasize athleticism and projection. He pitches in the low 90's with an average-ish fastball, a slider that flashes above-average, and a repeatable delivery that can produce above-average command. This is a prototypical high school projection arm: size, arm strength, some spin, and premium athleticism. PERSON has now take a multi-sport athlete with each of their last two second round picks. Elevating PERSON above other prep arms in the system is his more consistent velocity, health and physical and technicaly projection.",0
" The ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON in the fourth round in 2011 Draft out of PERSON (Fla.) CC, only to see him spend his first three seasons in GPE ball before having a breakout full-season debut in '14. The ORGANIZATION acquired him in May 2015 in exchange for two international bonus slots, and PERSON continued to impress in his first season in the system, reaching Double-A for the first time, and he was added to the 40-man roster following the year. His 2016 campaign was marred by a left shoulder injury that kept him from taking the mound until late in the offseason. PERSON healthy in 2017, PERSON scuffled in the first half while pitching in Triple-A PERSON's starting rotation.   An athletic southpaw, PERSON pitches at 89-93 mph with his fastball but can reach back for a few extra ticks, throwing the pitch down in the zone with late life and running action so as to induce ground-ball outs. His hard, sweeping slider is above average, flashing plus at times, and it's a major weapon against left-handed hitters. PERSON's changeup lags behind the two offerings, which has caused problems against right-handed hitters throughout his career and limits his ability to turn over a lineup.  PERSON has cleaned up his mechanics since joining the ORGANIZATION and it's allowed him to repeat his delivery more consistently. His control remains below average, though, and he'll need to develop a more effective changeup to remain a starter. If that doesn't work out, PERSON's fastball-slider pairing and strong track record against lefties could help him carve out a bullpen role as soon as 2017.",0
"UC PERSON had a pair of pitchers from its staff get drafted in the top five rounds in 2015, with PERSON going No. 4 overall and PERSON landing in the fifth. While you typically ""Never Say Never"" in the GPE, it's unlikely PERSON will land in GPE territory, but the three-year starter should hear his name called before PERSON did.Right now, PERSON is the epitome of the advanced, yet not exciting, college arm. A Sunday starter a year ago, the right-hander has served as ORGANIZATION's Friday night guy after a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION last summer. He doesn't have a true out pitch, using three average offerings effectively. He generally pitches around 90-91 mph, but there could be some more velocity to unlock at the next level. He mixes in a solid slider and changeup and pounds the strike zone with all three pitches.A lack of a true out pitch limits PERSON's ceiling, but his polish and track record will interest many teams. The fact he could move quickly and teams won't have to ""PERSON"" him should also work in his favor.",1
"PERSON hit .413 at ORGANIZATION's River (Fla.) CC as a sophomore in 2015 and impressed the ORGANIZATION in a pre-Draft workout, so they took him in the 12th round and signed him for $100,000. After a mediocre pro debut, he spent the first six weeks of 2016 in extended spring training but went on to win the ORGANIZATION League batting title with a .358 average. He has continued to hit in 2017, challenging for the batting lead in the high Class A ORGANIZATION League.A right-handed hitter, PERSON utilizes an extreme opposite-field approach and has a knack for placing balls where fielders can't get them. He has turned on a few more pitches this year but is still specializing in serving line drives to right field. The tradeoff is that he doesn't produce much power, so much of his offensive value comes from his ability to control the strike zone, make contact and get on base.PERSON's best pure tool is his well-above-average speed, which he's doing a better job of translating into stolen bases. He's a legitimate center fielder with enough range and arm strength to play anywhere in the outfield.",1
"A two-way player at LOCATION, serving as a first baseman and closer, PERSON was one of the more intriguing seniors in the GPE class of 2015. The PERSON had him begin his career as a starting pitcher. It didn't take, but a move to the bullpen at the end of the season and during instructs did, which should hasten his arrival to the big leagues.PERSON did get stretched out and worked on developing his pitches as a starter, but his stuff really played up once he was shortened back up as a reliever. In those outings, his fastball sat in the 95-98 mph range with some good movement. His slider got crisper too, a plus breaking ball that misses bats. Getting back into attack-the-hitter mode, PERSON found the strike zone with greater consistency in short stints.The PERSON didn't want PERSON to compete with just his fastball, a lesson he learned while scuffling through his time as a starter. The bullpen is his full-time home now, and he should start moving more quickly now as a setup type who can handle multiple innings.",0
"PERSON had two relatively nondescript offensive seasons as PERSON's starting catcher before breaking out as a junior and hitting .310/.432/.563. That the 2016 Draft class featured an underwhelming crop of catchers and college hitters only added to PERSON's value, and the ORGANIZATION took him with the 72nd overall pick in June. He signed for slightly less than pick value, made his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League and then advanced to full-season ball in 2017. A switch-hitter, PERSON showed vastly improved feel to hit during his junior season, hitting for average and some extra-base ability, while walking more than he struck out. But because he lacks physicality and has only average bat speed, scouts are skeptical about his power translating in the ORGANIZATION. On defense is where PERSON really shines, and there's little doubt that the former Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year can stick behind the plate. He has average receiving skills and an average arm that has been effective at times in controlling the running game. The floor might be higher than the ceiling with PERSON, but there's a lot to like in a guy who could develop into a solid backup catcher, possibly even a starter.",0
" The ORGANIZATION got the power lefty from the ORGANIZATION at the 2012 trade deadline for PERSON and they should be able to reap the benefits soon. PERSON has struck out close to 12 per nine innings over the course of his ORGANIZATION career, using a power two-pitch combination to go right after hitters and miss a lot of bats. His fastball can be plus, up to 95 mph with late life and sink. His hard slider gives him a second plus offering, a breaking ball with late bite that heâs not afraid to throw at any point. As his 56 saves attest, PERSON has been used to close games and assuming he can maintain his average command, thereâs no reason to think he canât serve the same role in the big leagues.",0
"As a high schooler in GPE, PERSON looked like he had a chance to be a five-tools monster. He was a svelte-but-strong 6-foot-3 with plus, unpolished bat speed, plus-plus footspeed and every physical trait necessary to stay at shortstop. A positive ORGANIZATION test ahead of the draft tanked his stock, and PERSON exhibited a steady physical decline in the year and a half that followed this revelation. Still viable at shortstop, PERSON's ability to swing the bat with verve has evaporated. His age and frame are still indicative of physical growth, but unless PERSON reclaims some of the offensive explosion he showed in high school, he profiles as a glove-only shortstop prospect. ",0
"Growing up in GPE, PERSON didn't have many opportunities to face top competition. His high school didn't have a baseball team, but he managed to play his way into the first round of the 2011 First-Year Player Draft.Despite his atypical background, PERSON has a mature approach at the plate. He lines balls from gap to gap and he knows how to work a walk. PERSON's swing has a little length to it, and he has been prone to high strikeout totals early in his career.PERSON is a center fielder now, but his average speed may eventually force him to into an outfield corner. His game still needs refining, but PERSON's on-base skills and quick hands give him the potential to be a solid Major Leaguer in time.",1
"Hailing from the same GPE high school as GPE right-hander PERSON, PERSON took an over-pick-value deal to sign rather than attend the ORGANIZATION of GPE, where his uncle had been an All-American pitcher.PERSON's solid stuff, projectability, makeup and bloodlines, make him an intriguing prospect. He already throws 88-92 mph, and there's room for growth in his 6-foot-5 frame -- with more angle than life currently on his fastball. PERSON has a feel for spinning the ball, but needs to add more power to his curve. He also could use more deceptive arm speed with his changeup, though it has some promising fade.PERSON has a loose arm that works well, and he could have three solid or better pitches once he gets stronger and maintains a consistent arm slot. With a former All-American uncle and a father who starred collegiately as well, the upside is clearly there.",0
"The best athlete available and the fifth overall pick in the 2011 Draft, PERSON turned down a scholarship to play quarterback at ORGANIZATION to sign for $7.5 million -- still a record for a drafted position player. He struggled to translate his considerable tools into production at the plate during his first three pro seasons, hitting .237/.326/.388 with 348 strikeouts in 310 games, but has made encouraging progress in 2015.Mechanical adjustments that PERSON honed during the offseason, such as adding a bit of a leg kick and smoothing out his right-handed stroke, have resulted in more success. He still can be fooled by offspeed pitches, though he's making more consistent contact than he had in the past. His strength, bat speed and leverage create at least plus raw power and he now has a better chance to tap into it.There's nothing wrong with PERSON's defense. He has solid speed, takes direct routes in center field, and parlayed his strong arm into a high Class A ORGANIZATION League-best 14 outfield assists last year. He's also an astute baserunner who projects to steal 20 or more bases per season at a high success rate.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 4, 2017 - PERSON, Calif.Favorite MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON commit, PERSON is touted as a catching prospect, though he has played multiple positions in high school. He was named to the 2016 Underclass 2nd Team and has played in two ORGANIZATION World Championships in the past.PERSON has a high leg kick at the plate and will over-swing at times, but he makes decent contact, and scouts note his aggressive approach. In the field, he has a slightly below average arm, but it should get better as he has more time to develop.",0
"Though there aren't many quality up-the-middle college players in the 2017 Draft, GPE PERSON had two of the better ones in shortstop PERSON and PERSON. A former walk-on, PERSON for much of his freshman year and played first base for much of his sophomore season. He starred as a center fielder in the ORGANIZATION last summer and then continued to shine there this spring en route to being taken by the ORGANIZATION in the first competitive balance round.PERSON's ceiling is that of a top-of-the-order tablesetter in a big league lineup. He has a quick left-handed bat, an eye for drawing walks and a mature approach at the plate. He concentrates on making line-drive contact during games, and while there are some concerns about how much impact he'll make with his bat, he flashes some raw power in batting practice, especially to his pull side. PERSON uses his plus speed well on the bases and in center, though some scouts would like to see him take better routes on defense. His fringy arm strength is enough for his position, though it will limit his usefulness in right field if he becomes a fourth outfielder rather than a regular.",0
"PERSON had three remarkably consistent years at ORGANIZATION and ended his college career with a .340 average. He has excellent hitter's timing and bat control, and his swing is athletic but compact, enabling not only high rates of contact, but also promising contact quality. That's not to say PERSON will have in-game power. He's a line drive hitter, an old school, two-hole type of hitter, the kind who's sort of an endangered species in the current big league hitting environment. Some teams considered PERSON's lack of power to be a bit of an issue in their pre-draft evals and thought he was more of a tweener fourth outfield type, a projection echoed by pro scouts who saw PERSON in the summer and fall. 
He has plus speed, speed that PERSON exhibited during instructional league even after he had been shut down for the summer with a foot injury. His frame is maxed out and he can't afford to slow down much and still be viable in center field every day, but while this creates some long term risk for his profile, he's fine out there right now. His most likely path to a sizable everyday role involves PERSON out-hitting what we currently have projected for his bat.",0
"The son of former big league player and manager PERSON, L.J. PERSON was a senior sign out of UConn who received a bonus more than $140,000 under the pick value of where he was taken. He's proven to be an even bigger bargain than anticipated, hitting his way through two levels of A ball before double-jumping to help out Triple-A Las Vegas in the playoffs, though he missed the start of the 2015 season due to a 50-game ""drug of abuse"" suspension. PERSON's best tool is his bat, a right-handed hitter with an advanced approach at the plate and solid on-base skills. While he's never going to be a huge home run hitter, he does have some extra-base ability. He doesn't seem to fear facing better pitching, and his bat got going further into the 2015 season. There were concerns about PERSON's defense, but he's improved at second base and the ORGANIZATION think he can stay there. An average runner, he might also be athletic enough to move to the outfield if needed. For now, PERSON will work on putting the suspension behind him and trying to prove he can develop into a decent offensive-minded second baseman.",0
"PERSON, who received the second highest bonus in the ORGANIZATION Sox 2017 international class at $1.4 million -- just behind PERSON's $1.6 million -- was the buzz of the LOCATION instructional league and has exciting potential. After dominating the ORGANIZATION during the summer, PERSON got a late call-up and played two games in the ORGANIZATION before his summer was shortened by a minor injury. He reminds some scouts of a potential everyday shortstop who takes a few games to grow on you. Unlike many high-bonus, July 2nd prospects, PERSON doesn't have loud, flashy tools, or exceptional twitch or physical projection. He's more of the steady, low-key type of player with excellent feel for defense (common among prospects from GPE, where there's more of a game-focused development) and high-quality contact. He projects to be an above-average bat with average raw power, and the swing attributes to have a chance to get to most of it. Deceptively quick for his size, PERSON has average speed and the defensive instincts to cover more ground than his raw foot speed indicates, as well as a plus arm. There's a chance PERSON outgrows shortstop, but he'd likely be at least above-average, if not plus, at third base in that event. It may be a card full of 5's (except for arm strength) on the 2-8 scale, with very little pro experience, but scouts are excited about what little they've seen here and think he could be a first division regular if the bat develops enough.",0
"The biggest thing holding ORGANIZATION back so far has been health. If he can stay on the field, he has the chance to contribute.ORGANIZATION turned out to be the ORGANIZATION' top signee in 2012 when PERSON didn't sign. A variety of leg issues allowed him to amass only 84 games in just over a year of pro ball. ORGANIZATION does have solid tools across the board. He has the chance to hit, with some power, from the right side of the plate. ORGANIZATION has the speed to steal a base and potentially stay in center field, though some think left field might be his eventual home.Before figuring that out, ORGANIZATION needs to get a full season of at-bats in. If it can all come together, he has the potential to at the very least be a valuable fourth outfielder type.",0
"PERSON works in the low-90s with a flat-planed fastball that plays at the top of the zone and a snap dragon, 12-to-6 curveball. He's not that projectable, but he's athletically built and has a good arm action. He needs to refine his strike-throwing pretty badly and it would be nice if he ended up throwing harder, but the repertoire works well together.",0
"PERSON could have been a top-three-rounds pick out of a ORGANIZATION high school in 2014 if he hadn't been intent on going to GPE, where he starred for three years. The most dynamic player on the GPE collegiate national team in the summer of 2016, he had the best all-around tools of any collegian in the 2017 Draft. Concerns about his strikeout rate caused him to slide to the ORGANIZATION with the ORGANIZATION. 23 overall choice, where they signed him for a slightly over-slot $2,897,500.PERSON is a quick-twitch athlete who will be a legitimate five-tool player if he hits. He has plus-plus speed, a quick left-handed swing and deceptive strength. He struck out in 24 percent of his college at-bats, swinging and missing against hittable offerings at times, leading to worries about his pitch recognition and whether he'll reach his offensive ceiling.Even if he doesn't hit for a high average, PERSON still can help a team win games in a variety of ways. He did a better job of using his lower half to generate power this spring and knows how to use his speed to steal bases. He also plays a quality center field and has drawn comparisons to an in-his-prime PERSON with a significantly stronger arm.",0
"PERSON spent almost all of his first three pro seasons in GPE ball after signing for $25,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2010. He led PERSON's all-prospect rotation with 11 victories and led the entire system with a 2.74 ERA in 2014, when he also won the decisive game of the low Class A ORGANIZATION playoffs.Though he has a 90-92 mph fastball that touches 95, PERSON is more about efficiency than overpowering hitters. He fills the strike zone and gets a lot of groundouts with the sink on his heater, but he doesn't miss a lot of bats.That may change if PERSON' slider continues to improve and can keep opponents from sitting on his fastball. He has yet to demonstrate much feel for a changeup, a shortcoming that eventually could lead him to the bullpen.",0
"As a sophomore, PERSON moved back and forth between pitching on Fridays and PERSON. In his junior season, the right-hander has been PERSON's Friday night ace all year and has been one of the more consistent college pitchers on the LOCATION this season.After a strong performance over the summer on the GPE, PERSON came out of the gate this spring pitching extremely well and helping his profile. Even as he's leveled off a bit, he's continued to perform, albeit in a slightly weaker LOCATION Conference. With a very quick arm, he delivers his fastball lin the 92-95 mph range. His secondary stuff isn't quite as good, but his hard slider can be an out pitch at times and he'll mix in a curve and changeup as well. While some worry that his arm is too quick and that effort in his delivery could mean a move to a bullpen, he's shown the ability to maintain velocity deep into starts.PERSON is also an excellent athlete, reminding some of D-backs prospect PERSON. That should help him repeat his delivery consistently and give him the chance to reach his ceiling as a mid-rotation starter.",1
" GPE is the kind of prospect who sneaks up on people. He doesn't wow you with any particular skill, but you can't help but like him more the more you see him play. That doesn't mean he doesn't have tools. He led the FACILITY organization in batting average and hits while playing at three levels in 2012. He then played 112 games with Triple-A Charlotte in 2013, but posted only a .241/.293/.296 slash line. The 2012 PERSON is a hard-nosed player who can spray line drives all over the field from both sides of the plate. He is capable of playing three infield positions and handles either up-the-middle spot capably. He may not have the highest ceiling in the world, but he's the kind of player who finds his way onto winning ballclubs.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 28, 2017 - PERSON, Fla.Favorite MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON, who had committed to PERSON, opted to transfer to ORGANIZATION for his final season of high school baseball. PERSON was a member of the 2015 17U ORGANIZATION Development Program and had his best game in the ORGANIZATION' 5-3 loss to the Stars in the second game of their schedule. PERSON tossed one inning, giving up just one hit and no runs while striking out two. Beyond ORGANIZATION, the pitcher participated in the 2016 ORGANIZATION and made four All-Tournament teams in four years, including the 2016 17U ORGANIZATION Championship when he played with PERSON Prime. The slender hurler pairs a fastball that touches 90 mph with a slow curveball that sits in the low 70s and a changeup in the 80s with cutting action. With some slight mechanical adjustments, PERSON could further improve his prospect status as he rises up the ranks.",0
"The ORGANIZATION had been linked for months to PERSON, a GPE defector, before signing him in late July for $1.5 million and a matching penalty for exceeding their international bonus allotment. He was one of GPE's biggest expenditures as it exceeded its international pool for the first time. Though he had limited success in sporadic playing time in 2012-14 in GPE's PERSON, he was one of the league's youngest players and fared better in the island's 18-and-under and 23-and-under leagues.PERSON stands out most for his offensive potential. He has a quick right-handed bat and has added strength since defecting, giving him intriguing raw power for a middle infielder. He's aggressive at the plate but makes consistent contact and uses the entire field.While PERSON has just average speed, the ORGANIZATION believe he'll be able to stay at shortstop. He has good actions and a quick first step, giving him range to both sides. He also has soft hands and solid arm strength that should fit well at second or third base should he need to change positions.",0
"Square-shouldered and long-limbed, PERSON already creates terrific pull-side lift with his swing and might grow into considerable raw power. He's very unlikely to stay at shortstop with some scouts moving him way down the defensive spectrum to either an outfield corner or even first base.",0
"PERSON had $1 million evaluations on GPE when he was in high school, just about half a million shy of what it likely would have taken to sign him. He matriculated to PERSON, where his abilities sufficed to push phenom PERSON over to second base. Indeed GPE is the rare college player who scouts saw as capable of playing shortstop. He's a plus-plus runner with a plus arm, and infield-worthy footwork and actions. Neither acrobatic nor sexy in any way, GPE's look as a defender, and his overall profile, has been compared to J.J. PERSON's. Like PERSON, GPE also has some power but his college swing likely needs to be altered for him to get to it in games. With player development now firmly ensconced in the era of swing changes, it seems reasonable to anticipate that GPE will make some adjustments. The track record for college shortstops is not great, but GPE has everyday tools.",0
"PERSON had a tumultuous and eventful amateur athletic career. He starred as a dual threat high school quarterback in GPE, and continued playing football in college even after the ORGANIZATION, who at the time were able to offer PERSON a now defunct two-sport deal structured to incentivize him to eventually commit to baseball, drafted and signed him. His college football career and home life were both tumultuous, as LOCATION went winless during PERSON's first year under center, and several members of his family had legal troubles. PERSON eventually transferred to PERSON, where he was asked to play safety. But that didn't last long and he soon committed full time to baseball. 
He's dealt with constant injury as a pro and has issues with quality of contact when healthy. Though he's a remarkable athlete with huge raw power and speed, we're bearish on PERSON's ability to hit breaking stuff and do enough damage to play everyday. He projects as a bench outfielder. Because PERSON has only been totally devoted to baseball since 2015, there's a chance some of what currently impairs his on-field production can be remedied, but he has to stay on the field to develop that stuff.",1
"In 2016, the ORGANIZATION took four high school pitchers with their top six picks and signed all of them. PERSON, a prepster from GPE, was the last of the quartet, getting $1.2 million to forgo his commitment to the ORGANIZATION of GPE. After leading the system in ORGANIZATION in his first full season, he streaked across three levels of the Minors to make his big league debut in 2018, the first high schooler from his GPE class to do so.Once upon a time, people saw PERSON as a future reliever because of his size, stuff and bulldog mentality. A former high school football player, PERSON goes right after hitters with his three-pitch arsenal. His fastball typically sits in the low-90s, but he's shown the ability to ratchet it up to 97-98 mph at times, and he throws it with a lot of sink to get ground-ball outs. His breaking ball still gets slurvy at times and can look like a slider or a curve depending on when you see it, but it's an effective pitch, especially when it's harder and tighter. His changeup keeps improving and flashes above-average at times. All of his stuff plays up because he can command it well and has shown fearlessness on the mound throughout his quick run up the organizational ladder. He's convinced evaluators he can start, with a ceiling perhaps as a mid-rotation starter, though the ORGANIZATION' pitching depth could send him to the bullpen, at least in the short-term.",1
"GPE won't wow you with tools, but he's the type that just goes out and gets the job done. The one thing he's shown he can do is hit. He makes a ton of contact, rarely strikes out, draws walks and looks like he should be able to continue hitting for a high average. He's the perfect No. 2 type hitter, one who can move runners, hit-and-run and hit when behind in the count. He makes the plays defensively without much flash. He played second base in the ORGANIZATION in 2011 and many feel that he'll eventually slide over there permanently and become a very solid everyday big leaguer on the right side of the infield.",1
"PERSON, who had a cameo in the movie ""The ORGANIZATION"" as a high school quarterback, started at shortstop for four years at ORGANIZATION but lacked the quickness to play there as a pro. The ORGANIZATION moved him behind the plate as soon as they signed him for $40,000 as an eighth-rounder in 2013, hoping he can make the same successful infielder-to-catcher transition that PERSON made a decade earlier.PERSON's conversion is off to a promising start, as he made the low Class A ORGANIZATION All-Star Game in his first full pro season and the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON in his second. He has the soft hands, arm strength and leadership skills needed to make it work, though his release and receiving will require a lot more polish. He also has spent time at third base in 2015, enhancing his versatility.Though he has posted solid offensive numbers as a pro, PERSON probably won't hit enough to be more than a big league backup. He makes contact but doesn't have much power and rarely walks.",0
"The ORGANIZATION had success drafting an athletic catcher in 2010 when they picked J.T. GPE, a converted shortstop, in the third round. Five years later, the organization hopes to have similar success with the development of backstop PERSON, its sixth-round pick from the 2015 Draft who received an above-slot bonus of $540,000 to forgo his commitment to PERSON State.Similar to GPE, PERSON stands out for his all-around athleticism behind the plate. His plus arm strength is his loudest tool, but he also earns praise for his actions and receiving skills. The ORGANIZATION believe that he will eventually come into his own as a hitter, especially after he flashed some offensive potential during his 2015 pro debut by hitting .321 with two homers over 18 games in the ORGANIZATION League.A fractured right hand suffered last August delayed the start to PERSON's 2016 season, and he then landed on the 60-day disabled list in early July with a left hip injury. But once he's healthy, the ORGANIZATION are optimistic that he can develop into an athletic, defensive-oriented catcher who can also contribute with his bat.",0
"PERSON began his college career at ORGANIZATION State (Fla.) JC before transferring to GPE and leading the ORGANIZATION in home runs (16) as a junior in 2016. The PERSON made him their third-round pick that June, and PERSON immediately rewarded the club with a strong pro debut. That success followed PERSON into his first full season, as he erupted to hit .329 with 32 home runs and 32 doubles between Class A Advanced PERSON and Double-A Bowie, and then became the first player from his GPE class to reach the Majors when the PERSON called him up in September. Facing high expectations in 2018, PERSON was limited by shoulder injury during Spring Training and struggled to find his swing back in Double-A before landing on the disabled list with an ankle injury in May. PERSON features a short but explosive swing, combining bat speed with natural feel for the barrel to generate hard contact to all fields, with easy, plus raw power to his pull side. He can handle velocity fine and has a knack for punishing mistakes, though an aggressive approach does make him vulnerable to quality secondary offerings. That should improve with experience, giving PERSON the potential for an above-average bat with similar, if not better power in his prime. PERSON spent much of 2017 in center field before reaching the Majors, where he logged more time in right (14 games) than center (eight). His speed and range, both slightly above average, make him a quality defender at both positions, while his accurate, plus arm is a natural fit in right. Revered by club officials for his ""grinder"" mentality and all-out playing style, PERSON is on the fast track to becoming an impact, everyday player at the highest level.",1
"ORGANIZATION might have surpassed PERSON (ORGANIZATION, 10th round, 2010) as the highest pick ever directly out of the ORGANIZATION if he hadn't moved to GPE for his high school senior season. The son of a 1988 Olympics taekwondo participant (ORGANIZATION) and a former sprinter (ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION), he may have the best chance to remain a starter among the ORGANIZATION's best prep arms this spring. He's also strongly committed to GPE, so he could slide out of the top five rounds.Projectable and athletic, ORGANIZATION could have two plus pitches once he matures physically. He can reach 95 mph early in games and sit at 90-93 with riding action for stretches, though his velocity faded a bit as the ORGANIZATION approached. He gets good break on his upper-70s slider, which should be a more dynamic offering once it adds more ORGANIZATION already shows the ability to throw his changeup for strikes. He has a fairly clean delivery, which allows him to repeat it well but doesn't provide much deception. He could have the upside of a No. 3 starter once he gets stronger.",0
"Drafted out of a GPE high school in the 22nd round in 2012, PERSON decided to attend PERSON. He barely pitched for the ORGANIZATION as a freshman, then transferred to GPE for his sophomore season. If he doesn't turn pro this summer, he'll move on to Auburn.PERSON draws mixed reviews. Scouts who like him praise his big, athletic frame and his arm strength. He works with a 91-93 mph fastball that touches 95 and features some sink and armside run, and he also flashes a promising low-80s slider.PERSON's detractors question his delivery -- which features a long arm action with a hook in the back -- his secondary pitches and his toughness. He has a decent changeup that could be helpful if he refined it with more use, and he also throws a slow curveball that he might be better off scrapping. He throws strikes but needs better command.",0
"PERSON's explosive toolset is undermined by his exploitable, pull-heavy approach to contact and his propensity to chase. These deficiencies make him very easy for right-handed pitchers to beat by feeding him breaking balls away, which he can often neither touch nor take. Despite this, there's a viable path to big league playing time for PERSON because he sees lefties well-enough to hit for difference-making power against them, and his speed and arm are assets on defense. He has a chance to be a good role-playing ouitfielder, but PERSON's approach means his floor is like the bottom of a wet paper bag.",0
"PERSON was pitching in the ORGANIZATION as a 16-year-old when the ORGANIZATION signed him in 2011. He had no trouble adjusting to pitching in the GPE and was the youngest player in the ORGANIZATION on Opening Day in 2013.PERSON throws his fastball in the low- to mid-90s with good movement. His slider is his best offspeed pitch, and his changeup shows promise. He is the nephew of former ORGANIZATION reliever PERSON, and his bloodlines seem to have helped. He has better command and more pitchability than most teenagers.PERSON underwent PERSON surgery in July 2013 and returned to the mound this July, a little less than a year later. Though he missed most of the 2014 season, he won't turn 20 until Spring Training 2015, so he has time on his side and the stuff to get back on track.",1
"When PERSON was selected in the first round of the 2014 Draft, the hope was that he'd be a quick-to-the-big-leagues type college hitter. After his first full season, when he reached Double-A albeit without dominating, it looked like he might still fit that profile. A full season in Double-A in 2016, however, saw him go in the wrong direction.PERSON got off on the wrong foot when he injured his hamstring playing for PERSON in the World Baseball PERSON in March 2016. Though he joined PERSON in mid-April, he didn't really have his base under him as a result of the injury. PERSON falls into the bad habit of trying to generate power too much, forcing him to pull off the plate and lose coverage of the outer third. A shortstop at ORGANIZATION, he still sees some time there, but he saw more at second, where he's an above-average defender while also mixing in some good glovework at third.PERSON did finish the 2016 season on much better footing than he started, raising his OPS by 120 points in the second half. He was able to use that as a springboard to a bit of a bounce-back 2017 season that saw him reach Triple-A.",0
"The D-backs were very cautious with PERSON during his debut season after signing him out of GPE for $450,000 in 2014, partially because of a back issue and partially to manage his innings. The slender right-hander nevertheless made a very strong first impression, including an appearance in the 2015 ORGANIZATION. After being held back to start the 2016 season, PERSON struggled with an assignment to the GPE League and was moved back to short-season ball, with concerns about his durability mounting.PERSON has shown the ability to pitch off of his low-90s fastball, commanding it precisely to all parts of the strike zone. He also has an outstanding changeup that serves as an out pitch, getting swings and misses consistently. His curve is still developing, but he knows how to spin it, and it could at least be PERSON average. He does have some physicality, but his 6-foot-1 slight build hasn't lent itself to adding strength.The D-backs had hoped to take the gloves off in terms of PERSON's development, but that hasn't been the case. If they can get him physically ready, his advanced feel for pitching, mound presence and plus makeup should all let him start to move up the ladder, with a chance to pitch in the middle to back of a rotation in the future.",0
"PERSON' swing needs work. His stride and bat path both have problems, but he swings hard and has promising hand-eye coordination and bat control despite his current issues. Additionally, PERSON has a lean, projectable frame, he's a plus runner and athletic infield defender who already has experience at multiple positions, and he has above-average bat speed. Some of the mechanical components in the batters box will need to improve, but the raw material here is exciting. Most players this age are older high school or junior college draft prospects. Measured against amateur players his age, PERSON would probably go in the top 50 picks.",0
"A highly regarded two-way player coming out of high school in 2012, PERSON was selected in the compensation round. The A's made him a full-time hitter, and PERSON showed why in 2013. He ranked second in the ORGANIZATION with 23 home runs as a 19-year-old. PERSON has shown even more power this season in high Class A.PERSON has a quick and easy swing that gives him the potential to hit for average as well as power. His swing does have a tendency to get long, making him prone to strikeouts.PERSON is a well-below-average runner, which contributed to the A's moving him across the diamond from his high school position of third base. PERSON has good hands and he looks like he could develop into an excellent defensive first baseman.",1
"The ORGANIZATION actually picked PERSON one spot ahead of PERSON in the first round of the 2009 Draft. While PERSON was rocketing to superstardom, PERSON had trouble staying healthy. He finally did so the past two seasons, hitting a combined 40 homers while reaching Double-A, before GPE sent him to ORGANIZATION in a trade for PERSON Freese.PERSON has the tools to hit for some average and power in the big leagues. He has a quick bat, and he has room on his frame to add some more strength. PERSON is very aggressive at the plate, something pitchers might exploit at higher levels.PERSON has played all three outfield positions in the Minors, fitting best in right field with his average arm and his fringy speed. The ORGANIZATION have a logjam of outfield talent, so his versatility could help when he is ready for ORGANIZATION.",1
"A 23rd round pick in 2011 from GPE, PERSON has never been considered much of a prospect. But he has hit everywhere he's gone, from college to the ORGANIZATION, and his breakout season at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Inland Empire has been too much to ignore. None of PERSON's tools stand out, but he does everything well. He creates good bat speed from the left side, which translates into solid power. He is an aggressive hitter and has room to improve his pitch recognition. Defensively, he has settled into left field after moving around the diamond in college. That puts more pressure on his bat, but as he's shown so far, that might not be a problem. PERSON will have to prove his breakout isn't a product of the GPE, but he has firmly put himself on the map as a prospect.",0
"Though PERSON shows no signs of ever slowing down, the ORGANIZATION invested in a pair of promising young third-base prospects in 2016. After signing PERSON for $675,000 as a third-round pick in June, they landed PERSON three months later for $1.1 million. He played two seasons in GPE's top league as a teenager, batting a combined .259/.335/.328.Like PERSON, PERSON doesn't have one standout tool but does possess the potential to contribute across the board. His raw right-handed power attracted the most attention from scouts, and he has the approach and hitting ability to translate it into game production. His speed reportedly has improved since he left GPE, with some evaluators now giving it above-average or plus grades.PERSON played five positions in GPE's PERSON: third base, first base, second base, right field and left field. He has average arm strength and should have enough quickness to stay at the hot corner. If he can't handle third base, the outfield corners are his likely next destination.",0
"The younger brother of ORGANIZATION pitching farmhand PERSON, this PERSON will make it to the next level with his bat. Most feel he's going to hit, but the question of where he profiles defensively has limited his GPE stock.A member of the GPE 18 and under national team that won gold in GPE last September, PERSON had a monster senior season that saw him shatter his school's home run record, previously held by his brother. While there is some swing and miss to his game, many scouts love PERSON's explosive bat speed, which should translate to continued power as a pro. A well below-average runner, no one projects PERSON to stay at shortstop, his high school position. Some see an offensive-minded second baseman in the future and some teams have asked PERSON to work out behind the plate, where his above-average arm could work well.PERSON gets extremely high marks for his makeup and he's been willingly accommodating team's requests to try different positions. That, plus his bat, are what could get him off the board in the first three or four rounds.",0
"PERSON helped his cause in the 2016 ORGANIZATION by displaying some of the best spin rates at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship in the fall before his senior year, and then getting off to a fast start last spring. Though his velocity dipped as the ORGANIZATION approached, he still went in the third round. The first player ever selected out of GPE (ORGANIZATION, GPE), the alma mater of big leaguer PERSON (who was drafted out of junior college), he signed for an above-slot $1 million. PERSON had a low-80s fastball as a sophomore but now works at 90-93 mph and hits 95 after he began to mature physically. There's still considerable projection remaining in his lanky 6-foot-6 frame, so he could continue to add more velocity. The high spin rate on his heater gives it riding life that makes it difficult to barrel. Though he also generates high spin rates on his curveball, PERSON has had more success with a harder slider that he began throwing during his senior season. He has just begun to work in earnest on his changeup, which is too firm at this point. His slingy delivery gives him deception and didn't prevent him from filling the strike zone during his pro debut.",1
" While any discussion of GPE is mostly about projection, the GPE thought enough of him after his 2011 GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION that they sent him to the full-season ORGANIZATION in 2012 at age 19. He may not have taken the league by storm, but the switch-hitting infielder-turned-outfielder did have double-digits home runs and more than 20 stolen bases. Heâs still learning how to hit, but has the chance to be a pretty good all-around hitter. If he can add some strength, there might be a little power down the road. If he refines his approach a bit, his plus speed could work at the top of the lineup and as a future above-average defender in center field.",0
"PERSON GPE, a ORGANIZATION III school in GPE, GPE, has had a grand total of four players drafted from its baseball program, the most recent coming back in 2001. PERSON not only is poised to become the first draftee since then, but also the first one ever with the potential to go in the top 10 rounds.The first thing that stands out about PERSON is his size, and it's something that came late to him. The right-hander was reportedly 6-foot-3 and throwing in the low-80s at the end of high school. Now he's 6-foot-10 and has added a lot of velocity, throwing his fastball up to 97 mph consistently. Because he hasn't always thrown that hard, PERSON has an idea of how to pitch, mixing in his secondary offerings effectively, flashing average sliders and changeups. While he comes across his body with his short-strided delivery, the ball comes out of his hand clean and easy, and he's thrown strikes this year.PERSON has become one of the most intriguing Draft prospects in the ORGANIZATION, if not the country. It's hard to know exactly what he'll become, but he's moved himself firmly into Day 2 Draft status, with teams likely to want to give PERSON the chance to figure it out in their system.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON fielded offers from several different schools including PERSON and GPE before settling on ORGANIZATION, where his father also played college baseball. The hurler had near a 1.13 ORGANIZATION and 120 strikeouts with PERSON and also batted .370 to boot.The youngster even fired a no-hitter this season against GPE, fanning 15 batters in the impressive outing.Brady has a medium frame and a slender build, and his compact arm comes to the plate out of a three-quarter slot. The right-hander throws a fastball, which sits at 87-89 mph and has glove-side run, and an 80-mph slider. He shows fair command of both pitches.",0
"â¢ 6/8: PERSON out for season after fracture in right ORGANIZATION under-the-radar prospect when the ORGANIZATION selected him with the ORGANIZATION. 72 overall pick in the 2014 Draft out of ORGANIZATION State CC, PERSON has been anything but that in the pro ranks. After finishing his second full season in Double-A, PERSON returned to the level to open '17 and received a quick bump up to the ORGANIZATION, where he helped pitch PERSON to a Governor's Cup title. Along the way, PERSON was named the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON as the U.S. PERSON's starting pitcher. Entering '18 on the cusp of the Majors, PERSON's chances of making his big league debut were dashed when he sustained a right elbow injury in February that required season-ending PERSON surgery. His rehab process was going smoothly and PERSON was nearing a return to game action in 2019 when he suffered a fracture on the inside of his right elbow while throwing a bullpen session in early June and subsequently underwent season-ending surgery.PERSON has no shortage of weapons at his disposal when healthy, as he'll show the ability to execute five distinct pitches in a given outing. He throws his fastball in the low-to-mid-90s, at times touching 95-96 mph with late sinking action, and backs it with a host of secondary offerings, including his trademark screwball as well as a plus changeup. His feel for commanding his above-average mid-80s slider down in the zone gives him yet another out pitch, while his curveball represents a quality change-of-pace offering. Throwing strikes has never been a problem for PERSON, whose natural athleticism, smooth mechanics and repeatable delivery all work in harmony to allow him to pound the zone consistently. He's also a fearless competitor on the mound, one who receives raves for his ability to mix pitches, set up hitters and execute a game plan.PERSON probably would have already established himself as a fixture in GPE's starting rotation had his 2018-19 campaigns not been wiped out by injuries. While it's yet to be seen how PERSON's latest setback might impact his future role, it's safe to assume that the ORGANIZATION will be extra cautious in managing the right-hander's rehab process. If all goes as planned, PERSON should return to the mound at some point in 2020, in his age-25 season.",0
"The ORGANIZATION went well above slot to secure PERSON, signing him for $325,000 as an 18th-round pick in 2011. A reliever from the outset of his pro career, he made a steady climb through the ORGANIZATION en route and made his big league debut in August 2015. PERSON has ideal stuff for a late-inning bullpen role. His fastball typically sits between 93-96 mph, but he showed the ability to push it as high as 98 in 2015. His slider has fastball velocity at 89-92 mph, thrown with tight spin and late, short slicing action that helps him miss bats, and he'll mix in a curveball sparingly to give hitters a different look. The right-hander has some crossfire to his delivery, which gives him natural deception but limits his strike-throwing potential. PERSON and command issues aside, PERSON's knack for generating whiffs with his fastball-slider pairing highlights his late-inning potential in the big leagues.",0
"After spending his freshman year at ORGANIZATION (Calif.), PERSON transferred to PERSON and became the highest-drafted player in GPE history, when he went in 2014's seventh round after going 11-0 with a 1.68 ERA as a sophomore. PERSON surpassed PERSON when the ORGANIZATION took him in the fourth round this June, but the latter still has the chance to become PERSON's first big leaguer. He threw 7 1/3 shutout innings to win the clincher in the high Class A GPE League playoffs to cap his first full pro season and swiftly climbed to Triple-A in his second.PERSON lived off a sinker that sat around 90 mph in college and has ticked up to 92-93 mph in pro ball, now topping out at 96. His fastball plays better than its average velocity thanks to its heavy life. He has feel for a changeup that can become at least an average No. 2 pitch, and he also can mix in a slider and a cutter that sometimes blend together.PERSON pounds the bottom of the strike zone, and though he doesn't miss a lot of bats, he has what it takes to be an efficient workhorse starter. He has bounced back from PERSON surgery in high school to put himself in position to serve the ORGANIZATION as a back-of-the-rotation or middle-relief option.",0
"Things started out so well for this GPE import, with an outstanding debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2013 and a strong showing in his full-season debut the following year. That all seems like a distant memory for PERSON, who hasn't thrown a competitive pitch since then. An elbow injury shut him down in 2014, then he tore his ORGANIZATION in that elbow the next spring, resulting in PERSON surgery. He was on his way back in 2016, when mono knocked him out of action yet again.PERSON was healthy enough to throw at instructs last fall, but because of how much he had been through, and because he had lost so much conditioning with his illness, the Twins just decided to let him pack it up and wait until 2017. Before he got sick, he was showing signs of getting back to the effective lefty with a four-pitch mix. His fastball can sit in the low-to-mid-90s and his best secondary pitch is his changeup, which he throws with good sink. He'll throw two distinct breaking pitches, with the curve slightly ahead of the slider, and he's generally around the strike zone.Even with all of the lost time, PERSON will pitch all of 2017 at age 21. With illness and injury behind him, there is reason for cautious optimism.",1
"The ORGANIZATION liked PERSON's pinpoint command while at ORGANIZATION State PERSON enough to take him in the second round of the 2015 Draft. The ORGANIZATION, who picked two spots later in that round, clearly noticed, acquiring PERSON as part of the ORGANIZATION trade during the offseason.To call PERSON, the third 2015 draftee to be traded the year he was selected under the ""PERSON rule,"" simply a strike-thrower might be like calling PERSON simply a painter. The right-hander walked just 0.4 per nine innings over the course of his college career. He'll need to continue to be an artist, moving the ball around the zone and pitching against the count, given that he has average stuff, at best, across the board. His fastball will touch 93 mph at times, but usually sits in the 88-91 mph range and has good sink to it. He'll mix in two fringe-average breaking balls and a solid changeup, all of which play up because he knows when to throw them and where to put them.Command artists like PERSON can move rapidly, making quick work of lower-level hitters. The ORGANIZATION may not know exactly what PERSON can become until he gets challenged by the upper levels.",0
"Signed out of GPE back in December 2012, PERSON had been slow to adjust to pro ball, though he was showing signs of life as a 19-year-old in the short-season LOCATION in 2015.PERSON has shown a pretty good approach at the plate from the left side, and it has started to translate into performance. He's not afraid to work counts or to take walks, and he's added some strength, which has given him more extra-base power and could result in solid home run pop as me matures further. PERSON has good speed and is an instinctive outfielder. He has the skills to play center, but sharing the outfield with draftee PERSON has pushed him to a corner, where his arm plays just fine.PERSON doesn't turn 20 until December, so there's plenty of time to be patient. The tools are all there for him to be solid big league outfielder in due time.",0
"On a very deep ORGANIZATION of GPE staff, PERSON has carved out a niche as a very effective college closer. But the right-hander might have the stuff to start and a team taking him in the opening few rounds might give him every chance to do so.Out of the bullpen, PERSON is up to 95 mph with his fastball. But he has a four-pitch mix that could work out of a rotation. In back of that fastball, PERSON throws a hard curve/slider hybrid in the low 81-83 mph range, a cutter that sits around 86-88 mph and a low-80s changeup. He tends to be around the plate.PERSON did give some a glimpse of what he looks like as a starter in the ORGANIZATION last summer. Gators starters like A.J. PERSON and PERSON might go ahead of PERSON, but his potential in a rotation could see him come off the board not long after.",0
"Of the similarly-aged pitching prospects on this list, PERSON actually has the best present stuff. He'll bump 96 from the left side and his mid-80s slider is already above-average. But PERSON has had trouble staying healthy. He had knee surgery in 2017, was shut down with shoulder inflammation in April of 2018, and didn't pitch for the rest of the year. If a move to the bullpen occurs to try to keep PERSON healthy, we think he could move quickly as a two-pitch lefty reliever.",0
"PERSON went from being a reliever to Friday night starter to first-round pick all in the span of his final season at ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION were thrilled he was there for them when they picked, as PERSON has the chance to have a four-pitch mix from an ideal pitching frame. He'll run his fastball up to 94 mph with good movement. He throws a slider and a curve, with the slider the better of the two as a true out pitch. PERSON's curve and changeup both project to be PERSON average pitches. He mixes his pitches well and is generally around the strike zone. His combination of size, stuff and pitchabiilty should allow him to move fairly quickly through the ORGANIZATION' system.",0
"GPE drew wide-ranging takes from scouts in the year leading up to signing with the ORGANIZATION as an 11th rounder from an Ohio high school. He played on the ORGANIZATION, the top travel team in the country, and was scouted often, with a decent but not great glove at third base, above average to plus power, and some feel for hitting and game power, but seemed a mid-round prospect. In the spring and into pro ball, GPE slimmed up a bit and now projects as at least average at third base, with similar raw power, but some pro scouts questioned his feel to hit. All the elements have been there at some point over the past year and some amateur scouts were really in on GPE -- one said he saw a lot of PERSON in him -- but didn't realize his price would end up being as low as it was once he started sliding in the draft.",0
"PERSON needed a shortstop to replace PERSON, now with the ORGANIZATION. So the ORGANIZATION went back to the ORGANIZATION, GPE, area, a region that had brought them standouts like PERSON and PERSON in the past, to find PERSON, a junior college transfer from GPE Joaquin Junior College. PERSON has had a solid season as PERSON's leadoff hitter, though a hamstring injury kept him off the field for a stretch this spring.With a strong and sturdy build, PERSON is an athletic shortstop who should be able to stay at the position. He has good hands and more than enough arm for the spot and his speed, which also gives him some basestealing ability and helps him in terms of range. At the plate, he's shown the ability to make hard contact with good bat speed. He has gap power to all fields and can drive the ball very well the opposite way. While his hamstring issue slowed him temporarily, he was back to full strength as the ORGANIZATION approached.Getting looks at him healthy as the ORGANIZATION hit postseason play could be important for his ORGANIZATION stock as missing time hurt him as a ORGANIZATION transfer without a long track record. His combination of tools at a premium position could be a very nice find in the top six rounds.",0
"Signed out of GPE in December 2012, PERSON spent a summer and change in the ORGANIZATION before making his GPE debut in the Rookie-level PERSON in 2014. Just 19 for all of 2015, he jumped on a slightly faster track by getting bumped up to the Class A Advanced California League shortly after leaving extended spring training, though he struggled there offensively.PERSON has the best overall defensive tools of any shortstop in the ORGANIZATION system, with plus defensive actions (his footwork and his hands), a strong arm and plenty of range. How much his hit tool can progress might determine his future role. He is a switch-hitter and a bit above-average in the speed department. While he doesn't have a bad approach at the plate, there's virtually no power there at all, and he doesn't project to add much more over time. If PERSON can add enough strength to at least make more consistent hard contact, he has the chance to be a glove-first shortstop or a defensive-minded utilityman in the future.",0
" Three GPE outfielders signed big contracts with PERSON organizations in 2012. PERSON and PERSON have already established themselves as PERSON stars. PERSON, the youngest of the three, had his development slowed this year by a stress fracture in his left tibia. He returned in time to play in the ORGANIZATION to help make up for lost time. PERSON combines a very good approach at the plate with good discipline. His plus bat speed gives him the ability to drive the ball to all fields and he has significant raw power. A solid runner, PERSON has an above-average arm, giving him both the offensive and defensive profile for a prototypical right fielder.",1
"PERSON finished 15th in ORGANIZATION Division I with a .389 batting average as a sophomore in 2014, but missed the following season after surgery to repair a torn labrum in his throwing shoulder. He returned in 2016 to lead D-I in on-base percentage (.558) and rank second in hitting (.424), setting LOCATION single-season records in both categories and career marks in both (.375, .483) as well. The FACILITY drafted the redshirt junior in the fourth round and signed him for $485,000.Some scouts considered PERSON the best pure hitter among college prospects in the 2016 Draft. Utilizing a smooth left-handed swing, he barrels balls consistently to all fields and controls the strike zone extremely well. He has enough bat speed and strength to offer at least average power.A catcher before he hurt his shoulder, PERSON shifted to first base for the ORGANIZATION last spring and broke into pro ball as a left fielder. He's a decent athlete who could get by in the outfield, though his speed and arm strength are below average.",0
"Though he had a solid career at GPE, PERSON never seemed to put everything together in college. The D-backs have worked with him to smooth out his swing since they drafted him in the sixth round in 2012 and are now seeing the results. PERSON was more of a slash hitter in college, but has learned how to tap into his above-average raw power as a professional. He has retained his patient approach and advanced feel for hitting, giving him the chance to hit for average as well as power. He has always been a good defender at third base thanks to his athleticism, strong arm and soft hands. With his above-average defense and the improvements he's made at the plate, PERSON has developed into a prototypical third baseman.",1
"GPE has built another strong recruiting class around GPE high school outfielder PERSON, a likely first-rounder who probably won't make it to college, and the top five prep prospects in GPE. The best of that group is PERSON, who helped GPE (GPEpolis) to the GPE 4-A state championship in 2016 and will be the first player ever drafted from the school. He performed well on the showcase circuit last summer, displaying a consistent all-around game.PERSON has a sound left-handed swing and uses the entire field. Though he has mostly gap power right now, he has the solid bat speed and wiry strength to develop average power once he fills out his extremely projectable frame. He currently has plus speed but could lose a step as he gets stronger.PERSON offers a well-rounded defensive package as well. He has the quickness and instincts to stay in center field and the strong arm to also profile well in right. Also a pitcher, he can run his fastball into the low 90s.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in 2009, Torres tends to get overshadowed by fellow middle infielder PERSON in the ORGANIZATION system. He has played more second base the last two years in deference to GPE, a fixture on top-prospect lists, but it's the less heralded Torres who actually has put up better offensive numbers.A switch-hitter with impressive hand-eye coordination, Torres repeatedly barrels the ball from both sides of the plate. He won't have more than modest gap power unless he gets stronger, but he makes consistent contact and draws a few walks. He's a solid runner who's still learning the nuances of basestealing.Torres has enough arm and range to get the job done at shortstop, but he's an above-average defender at second base. He has quick hands and turns the double-play pivot like he has been doing it for years. He also has seen action at third base during the last two seasons, boosting his utility man cred.",1
"GPE signed for an even $1 million in July and was, in our opinion, the most well-rounded pitcher in his ORGANIZATION class. He's really loose, flexible, and athletic, and has some physical projection. He sits 89-93 right now and it plays at the top of the strike zone. He'll likely throw harder as he matures. GPE also has a proclivity for spin and his curveball already flashes plus. He checks all the traditional boxes for a teenage pitching prospect, has advanced pitchability, and his stuff works in a specific way (four-seamers up, curveballs down) that fits with contemporary pitch usage. Teenage pitching is risky, but every aspect of GPE's profile is indicative of improvement. He has a chance to be really good.",0
"PERSON's family fled PERSON when he was an adolescent and ended up in PERSON, where PERSON went to high school and junior college. He was a late-round pick in 2018 and immediately became of interest to pro scouts covering PERSON' ORGANIZATION club thanks to his advanced switch-hitting prowess and fundamentally sound infield actions. A shortstop as an amateur, PERSON saw time all over the infield last summer and looked comfortable at each spot. His frame limits his power projection and makes it less likely that he does sufficient offensive damage to profile as a regular, but he looks like a potentially valuable, switch-hitting bench piece, which would be a great outcome for a 22nd round junior college draftee.",0
"PERSON was one of the hottest players in college baseball early in 2016, hitting .455 through 22 games at ORGANIZATION before an errant pitch injured his right hand. Signed by the ORGANIZATION for a slightly under-slot $950,000 as a second-round pick, he ranked third in the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in batting (.321) and on-base percentage (.412) during his pro debut, then finished second (.301) and first (.397) in those categories in the Class A Advanced PERSON in 2017 before finishing his first full season with a strong month in Double-A. It now will be up to the ORGANIZATION to further PERSON's development after they acquired him and left-hander PERSON in February as part of a three-team trade with PERSON. PERSON has a long track record of hitting and getting on base. His right-handed swing is geared for stroking line drives from gap to gap, an approach that results in consistent contact but doesn't provide much power. He has the solid speed to beat out ground balls and the instincts to steal some bases.After DHing as a freshman and playing mostly the outfield corners as a sophomore, PERSON shifted to second base last spring. He has the quickness and reliable hands for the position, though he doesn't have the smoothest actions and some scouts believe he's destined for center field. The ORGANIZATION loved his gamer makeup and his work ethic, qualities that the ORGANIZATION also have been known to covet.",1
"GPE in GPE but of ORGANIZATION descent, the fully bilingual PERSON had a solid, albeit unspectacular junior season at GPE. His ability to play up the middle defensively and control the strike zone offensively interested the ORGANIZATION enough to take him in the third round of the 2016 Draft. While a thumb injury kept him out of a large chunk of his first full season, he was able to make his way from A ball to the Class A Advanced PERSON League.Despite the missed time, PERSON has shown a bit more bat than expected when he was coming out of GPE. He has good feel to hit and recognizes pitches well and if he stays within his approach, he has the chance to be a Major League average hitter. Though power isn't a big part of his game, he does occasionally get too big and try to leave the yard, something he didn't do when he moved up to GPE in 2017. He has very good hands at shortstop, with solid range, plus instincts and at least a solid average arm, meaning he can play shortstop full time in the future, though he slid over and mostly played second alongside ORGANIZATION in GPE in 2018.PERSON was drafted by PERSON in the ORGANIZATION Winter League this offseason and the infielder was able to work out with the team for a spell, an experience that must have carried over in 2018. His ability to play on both sides of second might help him fight through the logjam of middle infielders at the upper levels.",0
"If you're looking for a ORGANIZATION arm with big-time stuff, then ORGANIZATION might be your guy. He made his full-season debut in 2012 and while there's clearly work to be done, the arm strength alone is enough to make you sit up and take notice. Using a fastball up to 96 mph, ORGANIZATION struck out better than a batter per inning in 2012, finishing third in the system in strikeouts. He complements the fastball with a true, downer curve, which can be unhittable at times. His changeup is behind the other two, but more than anything, ORGANIZATION needs to improve his command. He's walked close to five per nine innings in his brief career and that will have to improve for him to stay in a rotation. The evolution from thrower to pitcher may take more time, but the electric stuff makes it worth watching the process.",1
"A high-energy infielder with good feet and a good throwing action on defense, PERSON ranks among the top shortstops on the international market this year. He has an accurate arm and it's slightly above average strength-wise, but he's been prone to fielding and throwing errors at times.At 6-foot-2, 175 pounds, scouts like his strength potential and believe he has the speed to be an above-average baserunner in the future. They also love his athleticism along with the idea of moving him to third base or the outfield in the future if necessary.On offense, PERSON has good bat speed and a solid approach with compact swing that plays particularly well in games. He was among the top prospects in the ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION) this year and was part of their elite travel squad that played exhibition games in GPE this spring.",0
"PERSON generated almost no interest as an Ohio high schooler, going undrafted in 2013 and getting just one college offer, an opportunity as a preferred walk-on rather than a scholarship from ORGANIZATION. Three years later, he became the second-highest pick in GPE history when the A's drafted him in the third round of the 2016 Draft.PERSON might have the strongest arm among catchers in his class, with multiple evaluators rating it as a 70 on the 20-80 scouting scale. He's more athletic than most backstops, too, and has the receiving and blocking skills to stay behind the plate.PERSON's bat speed and strength give him solid power potential from the right side of the plate. That was on display when he homered four times in his first eight games to start the season, before a broken hamate in his left hand sidelined him for six weeks. That being said, there is some concern about his overall hitting ability, as he never posted big numbers at ORGANIZATION and batted just .226 with wood last summer in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"It might be difficult to find a better athlete in the 2012 Draft class and there certainly isn't anyone faster. While he's sure to be a major basestealing threat, he's much more than a one-tool guy. PERSON has the chance to hit, with good bat speed and even a bit of power to grow into. There's some refining to his approach that will need to happen, but he has an understanding of what his game will need to be hitting at the top of the lineup. He's able to outrun any mistakes in the outfield, but projects to be an above-average defender in the future. He's been compared to PERSON, not a bad aspiration, but he might have the chance to have a little more pop and a little less swing-and-miss if things click for him.",0
"After a breakout season in his second go-round in the rookie-level PERSON, the ORGANIZATION were excited to let PERSON and his tools loose on full-season ball. He had trouble adjusting to the cold and wet weather in the ORGANIZATION early, then a pitch broke his ulna and radius, derailing his 2015 season. He bounced back in 2016, showing off some of his tools in the ORGANIZATION State League.PERSON looked like his old self at instructs last fall and it carried over into the season. The outfielder can do a lot of things well on the baseball field. He has a ton of raw power and is still learning how to tap into it more consistently. Improved plate discipline should help with that and allow him to be a better all-around hitter. PERSON runs very well and can steal a base and that speed allows him to cover ground in right field, where has the prototypical strong arm desired for that position.Based on his tools and his drive, PERSON could be a candidate for comeback prospect honors. Just 22, he appears back on track and headed toward GPE.",1
" Despite being a high schooler who barely pitched during his summer debut, the ORGANIZATION felt confident enough in PERSONâs abilities and maturity to send him straight to full-season ball for his first full year of pro ball. PERSON responded with an ERA that would have been good for third in the LOCATION PERSON had he thrown enough innings to qualify. The GPE prepster (coming from the same class as first-rounders PERSON and PERSON) has the chance to have three Major PERSON average or better pitches with solid command. His fastball and slider combination would be enough to excel in the bullpen, but if his changeup can continue to improve and give him that third pitch, he has every chance to start.",1
PERSON is your typical middle relief prospect. He sits in mid-90s and benefits from mechanical deception. His breaking ball doesn't spin a lot but it's spin-efficient and has depth and effectual movement. PERSON has better control than most relievers and spent time developing as a starter.,0
"PERSON is in the mix with PERSON, PERSON, and PERSON for the ORGANIZATION. 5 starter job, and while PERSON is the second-best prospect of that bunch, the decision is likely to come down more to March performance and a short-term outlook on being able to navigate a big league lineup. At his best in short stints, PERSON works 92-95 and has hit 97 mph, but usually works a tick or two below that as a starter. When the arm speed is at it's best, PERSON's fastball has extra life and his curveball, changeup, and slider all flash above average at times. As a starter, PERSON is more average to a touch above across the board and is an innings-eating backend type, but there's much less room for error and pitchers like this can find themselves on waivers when things get out of whack. Either version has big league value, but PERSON's best role may be a multi-inning relief type with four pitches, and he may get a chance to do just that in 2019 at the big league level.",1
"PERSON remains one of the better raw tools prospects in the ORGANIZATION organization, emphasis on raw. The ORGANIZATION knew they'd have to be patient with the GPE native, but the key was to get him on the field and give him the playing time and repetitions he's needed. That's been difficult as injuries have hampered his development. He missed nearly all of 2012 with a hip injury and has been dinged up since he's been a Red. Initially a shortstop in high school, PERSON moved to third during his pro debut, but did see some time at shortstop when he was on the field in 2012 and the ORGANIZATION want to see if he can stick there. More important than anything, though, is keeping him healthy.",0
"It's helpful to use the draft as a way of gauging where pro prospects fall on the ORGANIZATION continuum, and it's easier to do that when the player in question is of the appropriate age. On the brink of 21, PERSON is the age of draftable college players. Coincidentally, this year's draft has a similar type of talent who is similarly aged in GPE shortstop, PERSON. Both PERSON and PERSON are speedy shortstops with rare power for the position who also have issues making contact. PERSON is rangy and athletic, and has good defensive footwork and plenty of arm for the infield's left side. His hands are just okay, so evaluations of his defense can vary depending on what individual scouts think is important to play the position, and some teams want to see him tried in center field. 
PERSON has plus-plus bat speed and his hands work in a tight, lift-friendly circle, but he's so explosive that at times he's out of control (this is where the strikeouts come from). He managed to get to the power at Hi-A in 2018, when he homered 19 times, and if he can stay at shortstop and continue to mash like that in games, he'll be a good everyday player. We have PERSON in the 45 ORGANIZATION tier of the 2019 draft, which puts him in the mid-to-late first round; we like PERSON a bit more than that and think he'd be in the 10-15 range on a draft board. He'll move into the top 100 with continued statistical success at Double-A.",0
"There wasn't a better story at the 2015 ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON than PERSON. He originally signed with the ORGANIZATION for $725,000 in 2006 and stagnated for four years in low Class A before getting released in 2013. He served stints in three independent leagues before signing with the ORGANIZATION last October, and he has put up huge numbers in the upper levels of the Minors this season.If PERSON gets to the big leagues, it will be his huge power that takes him there. He probably won't post high batting averages and on-base percentages, but he has found more success since toning down what had been an all-or-nothing approach. While PERSON has a strong arm and broke into pro ball as a third baseman, he's strictly a first baseman. He's a well below-average athlete and runner who's a shaky defender.",0
"Signed in November 2013, PERSON spent his first pro season in the ORGANIZATION before impressing during his brief GPE debut last year in the ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION native graduated to full-season ball in 2016, earning mid-season All-Star honors in the Class A ORGANIZATION at age 19.PERSON's live arm generates easy velocity in a fastball that consistently sits between 92-95 mph with late life. His slider registers in the mid- to high-80s, thrown with late, short slicing action, and he also has the makings of an advanced changeup that he's already comfortably deploying against right-handed hitters.There are concerns about PERSON's ability to create downhill plane given his height, but, so far, he's shown that he can keep the ball in the park. Meanwhile, he should be able to tack on strength to his wiry frame as he matures physically, which should in turn improve his durability. PERSON has the arsenal and control profile to develop into a big league starter, although his fastball-slider pairing also give him a bright future as a reliever, one who can get outs on both sides of the plate.",1
"PERSON was primarily a reliever at ORGANIZATION before the ORGANIZATION drafted him in the 20th round in 2010. He began his professional career as a reliever, but PERSON moved him to the rotation in 2012 and he has responded well.PERSON's fastball sits around 90 mph, and he pairs it well with an above-average cutter. His curveball and changeup give him a chance to have four Major League-average or better offerings. PERSON has solid control and mixes his pitches well.PERSON is versatile enough to be either a starter or a reliever. If he did end up in the bullpen, his fastball-cutter combination would play up nicely. PERSON could soon fill either role for the ORGANIZATION.",0
"Scouting grades: Hit: 60 | Power: 50 | Run: 30 | Arm: 60 | Field: 55 | Overall: 55Regarded as the best two-way GPE prospect since PERSON in 1973, ORGANIZATION won the PERSON Two-Way Player of the ORGANIZATION in each of his three seasons at ORGANIZATION. He went 11-3 with a 2.56 ORGANIZATION and a school-record 146 strikeouts in 16 starts on the mound as a junior while also hitting .341 with 18 home runs and 57 RBIs to win the ORGANIZATION and PERSON as college baseball's top player. GPEed fourth overall by PERSON in June, ORGANIZATION received the second-highest signing bonus ($7,007,500) under the current set of GPE rules. ORGANIZATION operates with a 92-95 mph fastball that he commands well against hitters on both sides of the plate, though his velocity is prone to dipping as he works deeper into games. Both his curveball and cutter project to be above-average pitches, and he showed good feel for a changeup during his pro debut after using it sparingly at ORGANIZATION. At the plate, ORGANIZATION's smooth left-handed swing and mature all-fields approach led some evaluators to label him the best college bat in his class as a potential .300 hitter capable of hitting 20 homers per season. His lack of speed limits him to first base, but he proved a sound defender during his pro debut, and could become above average in time.",1
"The ORGANIZATION selected PERSON in the second round of the 2011 Draft because they saw him as a projectable outfielder with a big league body and multiple potential plus tools. When he hit just .221/.254/.275 during his first three pro seasons, they turned him into a pitcher in 2014. Twelve months after PERSON made his first professional mound appearance, he reached Double-A.Though PERSON did attract scouting interest as an amateur pitcher, he has advanced more quickly than anyone could have expected. A product of the same FACILITY (GPE) program that spawned PERSON, he had no trouble reacclimating himself, showing feel for pitching and the ability to repeat his mechanics and throw strikes.PERSON's best pitch is his fastball, which sits at 91-94 mph and reaches as high as 97. His slider has made strides this season, grading as a plus offering at times. PERSON's changeup lags well behind his other two pitches, limiting his ceiling to that of a late-inning reliever.",0
"A 12th-round pick from GPE who signed for $100,000 in the 2016 Draft, PERSON was largely a reliever in college. After a stunning pro debut pitching out of the bullpen, he moved into the rotation in 2017, finishing fourth in the system in strikeouts and sixth in ORGANIZATION, then moved up to Double-A, where he finished off a playoff no-hitter. His development is now in the hands of the D-backs, who acquired him in a three-team trade in February that sent PERSON to GPE York.PERSON picked up velocity in his introduction to pro ball, as his fastball soared from 90-93 mph to 93-97. His mid-80s slider can be a wipeout pitch at times but lacks consistency. To prepare him for starting, the ORGANIZATION had him focus on refining his work-in-progress changeup during instructional league, with terrific results.With an athletic delivery that he keeps in sync, PERSON should be able to provide strikes after sometimes battling his control while with the ORGANIZATION. He had ulnar transposition surgery on his pitching elbow in the fall of 2015 and also missed time with back and knee issues in college, but he proved to be durable over 27 starts in 2017. Even if he returns to the bullpen, he could be a valuable arm for the D-backs in the future.",0
"PERSON has a power forward build at 6-foot-8 and is an extreme power projection long shot. Scouts see 65-grade future raw power and a chance to stay in center field, so PERSON may be the heir to the ORGANIZATION young adult son hitting prospect throne.",0
"PERSON worked almost exclusively out of the bullpen during his first two years at PERSON, but a move to the rotation in the ORGANIZATION last summer opened a lot of eyes and had many wondering if he could start long-term at the next level. While hopes to see him in that role during his junior year were dashed when he returned to the bullpen, the PERSON deemed his overall upside worthy of a fourth-round pick as well as an above-slot bonus of $500,000. A big and physical right-hander, PERSON was effective as PERSON's closer this spring, setting a Cardinal record with 16 saves. After reaching 95 mph in the GPE, he was mostly sitting 90-91 mph and occasionally hitting 92-93 on the gun as a junior. His curveball remains effective and is his go-to out pitch, showing the ability to miss bats with it at times, while his changeup remains a distant third pitch. There is some effort to his delivery, resulting in inconsistent command as well as an inability to maintain his velocity deeper into outings when he was starting.PERSON has the strength and body to be a rotation workhorse, though he'll first need to refine his delivery. Most evaluators peg him as an effective setup type reliever who could move quickly in a bullpen role, especially if the velocity can return.",0
"PERSON may actually be even smaller than his listed size of 5-foot-9, 180 pounds. But what he lacks in size, he makes up for in hustle. His motor elicits comparisons to PERSON. PERSON has a short, compact swing that allows him to make a lot of contact. And he has more power than his size would suggest, but it still grades as below average. PERSON is a plus runner and knows how to steal a base. He has improved his defense and is a capable second baseman.",1
"Emerged in high school hitting the mid-90's, wasn't used a ton at GPE, then emerged as their second best starter this year. Works 93-95, touched 97, can land and average curveball and his changeup is usable, but he's more control over command and may fit better in relief.",0
"PERSON put up video-game type numbers at ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION this spring, raising his Draft profile in the process, then created a huge amount of buzz by hitting triple digits consistently in a bullpen session in late May. The ORGANIZATION drafted him with the second of their two picks in the first round, then signed the flame-throwing righty for slightly above slot value at $2,452,900. There is no question about the quality of PERSON's fastball coming from his 6-foot-6 frame. He was consistently up to 97 mph all spring and has shown an ability to throw strikes with it as well. His secondary stuff, however, has been inconsistent. He throws both a slider and a curve, though the latter is his fourth pitch, and on some days he has two distinct, effective breaking balls. At other times, they run together, and it might serve him well to focus on just one at the next level. His changeup has improved, but it also comes and goes.There is an injury history with PERSON -- he had a screw put in his right elbow in high school -- but he was nothing but healthy and durable in junior college. There's some debate over whether his future lies in the rotation or out of the bullpen, where his stuff would play up, but the ORGANIZATION feel that PERSON has all the ingredients needed to become an impact starter.",0
" PERSON was a two-way standout at GPE, playing the outfield and pitching on Saturdays for the top college program. His offensive game took a big leap forward during his junior season, moving into top 10 pick conversations. The ORGANIZATION nabbed him at ORGANIZATION. 8 and gave him $5.1 million to sign, an above-pick value deal.PERSON uses the entire field and while he often featured more of an inside-out swing from the left side, he did start to show more power during his junior season. While not a burner, PERSON does have above-average speed. He is capable of playing center field, but whether that's his long-term home remains to be seen. He is capable of playing all three outfield spots, with at least an average arm.After his huge junior season, which saw his stock soar, PERSON hit the ground running during his pro debut, moving to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League after a brief stop in the ORGANIZATION. He kept moving quickly during his first full sseason, hitting his way to Double-A Reading.",1
"GPE was a low-bonus, late-round, small school pick who still wasn't really on the prospect radar for most clubs until 2018. His velocity took a step forward (up to 98 mph) and the added armspeed helped his 50 to 55 type stuff grade out a tick better. This improvement made him a lock to be a Rule 5 pick if not protected, so PERSON added him to the 40-man roster. Like many of the 40 FV-grade relievers on this list, GPE projects as a middle reliever, but he has the best chance to turn into a bit more, and could possibly be a setup man.",0
"After transferring from PERSON (Fla.) JC to GPE, PERSON erupted to hit an ORGANIZATION Conference-best 16 home runs as a junior, leading to his selection in the third round of the 2016 Draft. He became the first player from his class to reach the Majors the next year, earning a September promotion straight from Double-A after he'd produced a .329 average with 32 homers and 32 doubles across two levels. In 2018, PERSON was limited by a sore shoulder during the spring and then lost nearly two months of the season to a stress fracture in his ankle that ultimately required offseason surgery. The injury bug continued to plague PERSON in 2019, as suffered a thumb injury during Spring Training that delayed the start of his season and also missed time with a hamstring strain in June. PERSON showed during his first full season that he has the physical strength, bat speed and barrel control needed to hit for average and power at the highest level. While injuries robbed him of some of that explosiveness in 2018, PERSON also deviated from the hit-to-all-fields mentality that had made him successful in the previous year, as he all too often sold out for pull-side power in an attempt to replicate his 2017 results. He generally has an aggressive approach that leads to a lot of contact but nets him few walks, thus underscoring how PERSON' on-base skills are linked to his production.PERSON has played all three outfield positions as a pro, but profiles best in right field because he has average speed and range as well as plus arm strength. He will need to hit for average and power to hold down the position in the big leagues, and the ORGANIZATION are confident that a fully healthy PERSON will be able to get back on track toward reaching his potential in 2019.",1
GPE isn't big but is a solid athlete with starter traits and solid average stuff.,0
"Since he arrived in Tuscaloosa three years ago, GPE has started every game at shortstop for the ORGANIZATION. His tools will fit better at second base in pro ball, but scouts love the way he plays the game and maximizes his ability.GPE has hit everywhere he has played, from high school and GPE national 18-and-under teams to the LOCATION and the ORGANIZATION. He makes consistent contact and generates good pop for a middle infielder with a compact right-handed stroke. He has on-base skills as well and might fit into the ORGANIZATION. 2 spot in a big league batting order.GPE's instincts allow him to play quicker than his fringy speed. He's not a flashy or rangy defender at shortstop, but he has reliable hands and makes plays. With a little more power, he could profile at third base if second base doesn't work out.",0
"After debuting in GPE's top league as an 18-year-old, PERSON defected in November 2014 and was declared a free agent by PERSON Baseball six months later. The ORGANIZATION thought they had signed him with a $2.5 million bonus last October, but the deal wasn't completely official and the ORGANIZATION landed him for $3 million. Because GPE already had exceeded its international bonus pool, it also had to pay a matching tax penalty. Though there are some mixed reports on PERSON, he has the potential to have five solid tools. He didn't display much pop in GPE, but he does have bat speed and has added strength since leaving the island. He can show impressive raw power in batting practice and has translated it into game production in the low Class A ORGANIZATION, which favors pitchers.PERSON's best tool is his speed, which is at least plus and earns plus-plus grades from some evaluators. He has the quickness to play center field but will need to hone his instincts to remain there. A two-way player as a teenager, he owns a strong, accurate arm that would easily play in right field.",0
"PERSON began his post high-school career at ORGANIZATION State ORGANIZATION before transferring to GPE Tennessee State, following in the footsteps of his older brother PERSON. The starting shortstop for the ORGANIZATION, PERSON hit .369 over two years there, leading to the ORGANIZATION drafting him as a senior sign in the ninth round of the 2017 Draft. While he signed for just $1,000, the infielder has continued to hit as a pro as well, posting a .315 average in his first full season of pro ball in 2018.The 5-foot-10 PERSON continues to show a knack for making a lot of contact that has carried over to the 2019 season. He is capable of spraying line drives to all fields and while he doesn't walk a ton, he also rarely swings and misses, keeping his strikeout rate at or below 10 percent for his career, though that comes without any power. A shortstop only at GPE Tennessee State, PERSON played the premium position almost exclusively during his first year-plus in the ORGANIZATION system. He's added more second and third base to his resume, with the ability to play solid defense at all three spots, in 2019.At 24-years old for the 2019 season, PERSON is a little old for his level. But as a money-saving senior sign, he's in many ways way ahead of where expectations were. He'll have to prove himself at every level, but he could carve out a career as a steady utilityman who can hit for average at the highest level.",0
"An undersized right-hander who has served capably as PERSON's Friday night starter, PERSON could fast track it to the big leagues should a team draft him and move him to the bullpen.That doesn't mean a team should give up on him starting just yet. While he isn't tall and projectable, he is fairly physical and athletic. As a starter, he'll throw his fastball anywhere in the 89-95 mph range, sitting comfortably in the 91-92 mph range. When he closed games for the ORGANIZATION as a freshman, he touched 96-97 mph in those shorter stints. His changeup is his best secondary offering and he has a really good feel for it, though he does throw it too frequently at times. He mixes in a slider as well.A team could send PERSON out as a starter to allow him to build up his feel for his three-pitch mix, but he could move quickly, with an up-tick in his stuff, in a relief role.",0
"The FACILITY may have grabbed the two best college hitters in the 2018 Draft in PERSON (first round) and PERSON (second). The latter has a long track record of success with wood bats, leading the ORGANIZATION in hitting (.406) in the summer of 2016 and serving as the GPE collegiate national team's most productive regular last summer. He improved in each of his three seasons at ORGANIZATION before signing for a well over-slot $2 million.PERSON shows uncanny hand-eye coordination and pitch recognition while employing a controlled approach, allowing him to spray line drives to all fields. Though he's not very big, he has a quick left-handed stroke and some deceptive strength that should give him at least average power. He continues to refine his plate discipline and should produce high on-base percentages.While PERSON's bat is his only above-average tool, his instincts help him play above his physical ability. Despite average speed and fringy arm strength, he was an acceptable defender in center and right field for the ORGANIZATION. PERSON will give him every opportunity to play one of those positions but he may wind up in left field.",0
"After a strong freshman season at GPE, PERSON blew out his elbow and needed PERSON surgery, knocking him out for the entire 2014 season. He returned in 2015, then came on strong in 2016 as a redshirt junior, landing in the fifth round of that June's Draft. He put the surgery even further behind him with a strong first full season of pro ball that saw him throw more than 150 innings and reach Double-A.More than anything, PERSON has a keen sense of who he is as a pitcher. He has a four-pitch mix, mostly average when graded out, but really knows how to use it well. His fastball is usually in the 91-92 mph range, though he can reach back for a bit more at times. He throws both a two- and four-seamer and has shown he is adept at getting weak contact on the ground. He has two distinct breaking balls, and is smart enough in his use of them to pick one over the other in any given start depending on the lineup he is facing. The changeup is just as good, if not a bit better, than the other three. He can throw strikes with any pitch at any point in the count.PERSON has already shown some mastery of pitch sequencing and making adjustments, something the Phillies expect to see after he fell victim to the long ball in the hitting-friendly confines of Reading last year. He could impact the big league rotation as a No. 4 or 5 starter at some point in the near future.",0
" GPE's first-round pick in 2010, GPE was dealt -- along with PERSON -- to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON and PERSON in December 2013. Throughout his career, GPE has been known for two things: his raw power and his propensity to swing and miss. He's lived up to his billing, hitting 61 homers and striking out 382 times in 371 professional games. Despite the big numbers in those two categories, he's not an all-or-nothing hitter. He does draw walks and he's shown an ability to make adjustments and turn things around. He's also fairly athletic and has played all three outfield positions. Even if he does settle in a corner position -- likely left field because of his below-average arm strength -- his bat should get him to the big leagues. Once he's there, GPE has the chance to be a better all-around hitter than perhaps people give him credit for.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"PERSON comes from a family with a background in football. His father, PERSON, was the starting quarterback at ORGANIZATION State when it won the ORGANIZATION I-AA national title in 1980 and his uncle, PERSON, is the defensive coordinator at GPE. But PERSON found his way to baseball and, after a steady climb through the ORGANIZATION, broke out this year at ORGANIZATION. PERSON has always had big raw power and it is now beginning to show up in games. He has a patient approach at the plate, but his long swing makes him susceptible to strikeouts. He is an excellent defender at first base. His breakout couldn't have come at a better time as he is already 25 and beginning to get pushed by PERSON. PERSON's ability to duplicate his success will determine his future role in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON has only started one game in his college career, but he flashes three plus pitches from the left side and has held his velocity and command in multi-inning relief appearances, so scouts project him to start.",0
"  GSP's conditioning and future position had some concerned about the GPE prepster as he entered his senior year of high school. But GSP shed weight, improved his overall conditioning and had a fantastic season to move into the top half of the first round. Then he went out and had as good, if not the best, of any debut by a 2012 draftee, finishing his summer in the full-season ORGANIZATION. GSP displayed outstanding bat speed and he should have above-average power in the future. He should become an even better all-around hitter as he learns to adjust to offspeed stuff. He's an average runner, maybe a tick above, but he's aggressive on the basepaths and should continue to steal some bases. It was initially assumed that GSP would have to move to third as a pro, and his bat would profile just fine there, but he's convinced many he can stay at shortstop with good hands, a well above-average arm and solid range. With his stunning debut, GSP could move more quickly than many high school hitters.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
"A talented two-way player from the ORGANIZATION high school ranks, PERSON wanted to hit as a pro. Many teams liked him more as a pitcher, but the ORGANIZATION were more than willing to let him swing the bat. A slow starter in each of his first two full pro seasons, PERSON still mashed his way to Double-A at age 20, collecting 20 or more home runs in each of those years. He capped off 2017 with a strong ORGANIZATION, finishing first in slugging, second in home runs and third in OPS.There has never been any question about PERSON's raw power and earlier questions about his ability to tap into it consistently have thus far been answered. He's become a better overall hitter and is quicker to the ball than when he first entered pro ball. While he'll always rack up strikeouts, he did lower his K rate and improve his walk rate in 2017 while moving up the ladder. PERSON also made huge strides in his defense at third and there are no longer concerns about his ability to stay at the hot corner, where his plus arm has always played well. He runs better than people might think at first glance, and some feel his athleticism would allow him to move to left field if there was a need or someone blocking him in GPE. For now, he'll continue to improve in all facets of the game as a third baseman, where he looks like he'll fit the power-hitting, run-producing profile in the mold of a ORGANIZATION type of player.",1
"PERSON had an inconsistent high school senior season in 2012, running his fastball up to 98 mph and flashing a nifty curveball on some days, and losing velocity and his feel for spin on others. In need of pitching, the ORGANIZATION invested a second-round pick and $1.05 million in him. He was inconsistent in his first two seasons but had his best year as a pro in 2014 after taking his conditioning more seriously.PERSON usually pitches at 92-95 mph with his fastball, and he could regularly work in the mid 90s once he fully matures physically. His hard curveball shows promise, while his changeup is more of a work in progress.Chicago knew PERSON would be a long-term project who would need time to develop. His control and command took a nice step forward last season, and if he puts everything together, he could be a mid-rotation starter or a late-inning reliever.",1
"We erroneously peeled PERSON off this list during the summer. When he departed his May 30 start after four innings, he had thrown exactly 50 career frames. The ORGANIZATION rule for rookie eligibility states that it has been exceeded when a pitcher has thrown more than 50 innings, so he's technically still eligible. PERSON has developed amid constant setbacks. He had a shoulder injury in 2015, a marijuana suspension that spanned the 2015 Fall League and start of the 2016 season, underwent PERSON later in 2016 and then suffered a right lat ligament detachment in his first big league start back from ORGANIZATION in 2018. The surgery to reattach his ligament took place in early June, which, with a six month recovery, means PERSON should be ready for 2019. PERSON is one of the best arm talents on the planet. His fastball will sit 93-97 and hover near 100 out of the bullpen. He'll also show you a plus changeup and curveball. His feel for each can be inconsistent, which is understandable given how little he has pitched over the last three years. If fully realized, PERSON has top of the rotation stuff. It's unclear how PERSON will usher PERSON along next spring, both as far as his role and workload are concerned. He has the stuff to be a dominant multi-inning or high-leverage relief arm should the ORGANIZATION think he's more likely to stay healthy that way. His innings total will likely need to be manicured somehow, and perhaps that's the way to go about building PERSON back up even if the org considers him a traditional starter long term.",1
"ORGANIZATION has the best all-around tools in the 2017 Draft, and his physical gifts have drawn comparisons to PERSON and PERSON. Both of those players were drafted No. 2 overall, but ORGANIZATION won't go nearly that high because of persistent concerns about his bat. Though he won the home run derby at the ORGANIZATION Games, he struggled at the plate for much of the summer showcase circuit, and he hasn't eased many worries this spring despite leading the nation's high school players with 25 homers and winning PERSON's PERSON player of the year award.ORGANIZATION's electric bat speed gives him huge raw power from the right side of the plate, but his propensity to swing and miss leads to questions about how much he'll be able to translate that pop into production. He has trouble catching up to average fastballs at times and must learn to recognize breaking pitches. A tremendous athlete who already has a big league body, he has well above-average speed and is a quality center fielder who usually has a plus arm (though it has been sore at times this spring).Though he'll almost certainly get drafted as a position player, ORGANIZATION is intriguing on the mound as well. He has reached as high as 97 mph with his fastball and can also spin a hammer curveball. He has committed to stay at home with PERSON if he attends college.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION for $7,500 in 2014, PERSON got off to a rough start at ORGANIZATION A GPE in 2015 and continued to struggle after a demotion to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League, resulting in another promotion back to the ORGANIZATION. But PERSON has gotten back on track this season in his return to GPE, where he's consistently missing bats and showing the ability to work deeper into games. The 6-foot-3 right-hander has big-time arm strength, working at 92-95 mph and topping out at 96 with his fastball, but his velocity is consistent because he struggles to repeat his delivery. That said, PERSON is just starting to grow into his wiry frame, and scouts envision him operating in the mid- to upper-90s once developed. His curveball has the makings of an average pitch, one thrown in the high 70s with decent depth and shape, although his inconsistent release point compromises its effectiveness. PERSON's changeup is a work in progress, and he'll need to develop it thoroughly to remain a starter.PERSON's inconsistent mechanics and lack of a third pitch make him to difficult to project as a starter long term, but, at age 21, he still has time on his side. At the worst, the right-hander's impressive arm strength and potential for two average-or-better pitches should allow him to carve out a late-inning bullpen role in the big leagues.",0
"A stress reaction in his back cost PERSON all of 2018 and his return to action has been slow; last we were updated before publication, he was still limited to fastball-only bullpens and flat ground sessions. Prior to PERSON's shutdown, he had experienced a velo spike (93-97, up from 91-94 the year before) and lowered his arm slot. Both of his breaking balls were excellent, but his changeup had regressed a bit compared to his first year (or at least, he lacked feel for it the last time PERSON saw him). The injury adds fuel to the speculative fire that PERSON's violent delivery will eventually limit him to the bullpen. It didn't prohibit him from having starter control, but scouts were concerned about injury. Now, there has been one. If health eventually moves PERSON to the bullpen, he has high-leverage stuff. If not, and his changeup returns, he could be a No. 3 or 4 starter.",0
"PERSON opened his senior season at GPE (Okla.) High in 2014 with consecutive no-hitters then blew out his elbow in his third start and required PERSON surgery. He spent 2015 rehabilitating his elbow and turned down the Indians as a 38th-round pick before enrolling at GPE. A rare Draft-eligible freshman, he led the LOCATION with 128 strikeouts in 102 innings before going to the ORGANIZATION in the third round of the 2016 Draft. PERSON's development accelerated in 2018, and the right-hander finished the year with a strong performance at ORGANIZATION, striking out 10 batters and allowing one hit in his final regular-season start, then firing another six-inning, one-hit gem in the LOCATION playoffs. He struggled to build on that progress in 2019, as a combination of control problems and diminished stuff led to a demotion from PERSON back to Class A Advanced GPE, and he ultimately landed on the injured list with tightness in the back of his shoulder in June. PERSON's power stuff is headlined by a plus fastball-curveball combo. His heater currently sits in the mid-90s with riding life, and there's a chance he adds even more velocity as he continues to distance himself from the surgery. His curveball, meanwhile, is a 12-to-6 hammer that he throws with power in the mid- to upper-70s. Together, the two pitches give PERSON the ability to induce ugly swings-and-misses, which he did at a near 15 percent clip in 2018, while averaging 9.5 strikeouts-per-nine. PERSON's split-changeup gives him a third above-average-or-better pitch, one that at times can be almost as effective as his curveball. While PERSON's dynamic arsenal and room for improvement give him a chance to remain a starter, most scouts project him as a reliever long-term because he doesn't have an athletic delivery, doesn't consistently throw strikes and his command is even more sporadic. He does create deception with his mechanics and does a good job attacking hitters north and south, using an aggressive nature that could work well in a high-leverage bullpen role.",0
"PERSON has the stuff to be a starter. How much he can transition from being a thrower to a pitcher will determine if he can reach that ceiling.The GPE teenager can light up a radar gun, has plus action on his breaking ball and he has a workable changeup. The most consistent hard thrower in the system other than PERSON, PERSON could have a 70 fastball out of the bullpen, and his approach and style point to a life as a future reliever. He's starting to understand what it takes preparation and conditioning wise to be successful long-term, and he is realizing that there's more to his craft than just throwing hard.The PERSON will let PERSON start for now, try to get him innings and increase his pitchability in the hopes a starter can emerge, but a career as a setup man is more likely.",1
"PERSON' electric arm could have made him a top-five-rounds pick out of a GPE high school in 2016, but his steadfast commitment to PERSON dropped him all the way to the ORGANIZATION in the 35th round. He opened his freshman season as a midweek starter before becoming a dominating closer in April and playing a key role in the ORGANIZATION' runner-up finish at the ORGANIZATION World Series. He moved into the weekend rotation this spring to fill a need, and though most scouts still envision him as a reliever, he's talented enough to go in the first three rounds as a Draft-eligible sophomore.As a starter, PERSON usually works with a 91-95 mph fastball and a solid slider. When he came out of the bullpen last year, he repeatedly ran his heater into upper 90s and backed it up with a wipeout slider. He uses his low-three-quarters arm slot and 6-foot-6 frame to create angle and life that make both pitches difficult to contend with. PERSON has yet to show much aptitude for a changeup, but also hasn't really needed one yet. He has toned down his delivery some but still throws with effort, and his arm action and fringy control may have him ticketed for the bullpen in pro ball. If a pro team makes him a reliever, he could be one of the first players in the 2018 Draft to reach the big leagues.",0
"If he hadn't been so intent on attending ORGANIZATION, PERSON might have gone in the first two rounds of the 2012 Draft, but he instead dropped to the ORGANIZATION in the 40th. He played a key relief role on the ORGANIZATION' 2013 College World Series championship club and served as their No. 1 starter the next two seasons. The ORGANIZATION drafted him 16th overall in June and signed him for $2.65 million.PERSON was one of six first-round picks on the GPE collegiate national team's pitching staff in 2014, and while he might have the lowest ceiling of that group, he also might be the safest bet among them to become a No. 3 starter in the big leagues. He has tremendous feel for pitching, advanced control and command for his age and a durable frame.His stuff isn't bad either. PERSON has a vanilla 89-92 mph fastball that plays up because he locates it well, and both his curveball and changeup are plus pitches at times. He also can mix in an average slider to give batters a different look.",0
"A potential first-round selection in the 2013 Draft until he had PERSON surgery as a ORGANIZATION high school senior, ORGANIZATION went to ORGANIZATION and signed for $1,847,500 as a supplemental first-rounder three years later. He's the older brother of the ORGANIZATION' PERSON, one of the game's best left-handed pitching prospects. PERSON hasn't progressed as quickly as his sibling because shaky command has limited his effectiveness.All three of ORGANIZATION's pitches can elicit swings and misses when he can steer them close enough to the plate to elicit swings. He can carry a mid-90s four-seam fastball into the late innings and reach 98 mph as a starter, though it's fairly straight, which has led him to fiddle with a two-seamer as well. He has a hard three-quarters breaking ball that would be more effective if he got ahead in the count more often to set it up, and a circle changeup that he should use more often.The Dodgers are trying to smooth out ORGANIZATION's mechanics to help him locate his pitches more efficiently. They still haven't given up on him as a starter, though the gulf between his stuff and his pitchability may point him to the bullpen. Given his small stature, the effort in his delivery and his medical history, there were questions about his durability even before his struggles in pro ball -- and getting shut down with forearm stiffness this May hasn't helped his cause.",0
"GPE is always enticing to teams and scouts and that's exactly what GPE brings to the table. The 6-foot-2 outfielder has an easy, majestic swing with well-above-average power and the ability to hit to all fields.Defensively, GPE has a chance to play center field, but he could wind up outgrowing that position and moving to a corner outfield spot. If that's the case, he still projects to be an average defender with an above-average arm in the future. GPE could lose a bit of his speed as he grows and fills out his frame, but he has strong natural instincts that would help compensate in the field.Alexis Quiroz of the ORGANIZATION in GPE represents GPE, who is expected to sign with the Brewers.",0
"PERSON noticed PERSON at ORGANIZATION Thomas More High (PERSON, GPE.) while scouting eventual Royals supplemental first-rounder Chase Vallot in 2014, and he developed into the state's best prep prospect for 2015. He went undrafted, however, because he wanted to attend his local college. Three years later, he should become the first Louisiana-PERSON pitcher selected in the first five rounds since the turn of the century.PERSON created a stir by hitting 98 mph in mid-March after missing a month with an oblique injury, though he usually pitches at 91-94 with some run and angle on his fastball. He has aptitude for spin, throwing a curveball with power and depth and morphing it into a slider at times. He also has an effective changeup to combat right-handers.While he possesses four pitches, PERSON also has a lot of work to do to remain a starter at the next level. He lacks reliable command, and he loses velocity and location on his fastball at times when he falls in love with his breaking pitches. He also has a history of nagging injuries, leading to questions about his durability.",0
"Though he's eligible to sign this year, PERSON hit the market late, when much of the finite aggregate pool money was already unspokenly spoken for by other players in the class, so it's possible PERSON waits until 2019 to sign in order to get a better deal. We consider the Reds the favorites to employ him. PERSON has a well-proportioned 6-foot frame with some room for mass. His right-handed swing is much more competent than his left-handed one at present but they're each viable pro swings with lift to PERSON' pull side. Defensively, PERSON' footwork is excellent, his hands/actions are fine and he should grow into enough arm strength to play the left side of the infield, but if he doesn't then he's a better fit at second base. There's interesting raw material here, nothing explosive",1
" PERSON is the type of player who fits the description, âThe whole is greater than the sum of the parts.â His individual tools may not wow you, but heâll grow on you the more you watch him play. PERSON has a solid approach at the plate with excellent plate discipline. He has enough pop, mostly to the pull side, to keep pitchers honest. His average speed plays up on the bases because of his outstanding instincts, and heâs the type of player who does all of the little things to help his team win. Thatâs true defensively as well. PERSON's solid arm and range play up because of his smarts on the field. He could be a decent shortstop, where he played after signing with the ORGANIZATION, a very good second baseman or even the type of super-utility guy winning teams tend to have. Coming from a program like GPE, it shouldnât take him too long to get there.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON in the second round of the 2013 Draft, the ORGANIZATION high school lefty was all about projection. A year, and a trade to the ORGANIZATION, later, it's still more about future potential than current performance. PERSON has a lot to work with, starting with a strong and projectable 6-foot-3 frame. He committed himself to an offseason conditioning program over the winter and that should help him find consistency with his fastball. Depending on the day you might have seen PERSON during his first year of pro ball, you might have seen a fastball in the upper-80s. On another day, PERSON may have been up to 92-94 mph, a range he should be able to settle in with, thrown with sink to generate groundball outs. He's shown the ability to spin the ball as well and continues to work on his offspeed stuff. PERSON has yet to make it to full-season ball, finally making it to short-season GPE in GPE, so he still has a long way to go.",0
"Before his breakout season in 2015, PERSON arguably was better known for his achievements as a model and actor, having made a pair of appearances on the television show ""PERSON"" a year after the ORGANIZATION drafted him in the seventh round. He was brought along slowly to begin his pro career but made huge strides during his full-season debut, pitching at three levels and finishing the season in Double-A at age 20. Although he hasn't fared as well this year in his second taste of the LOCATION, the right-hander has continued to hold his own against older and more advanced hitters. Tall and skinny when he was drafted, PERSON has started to grow into his projectable frame as a professional. The added strength shows in his climbing velocity, as he now sits at 92-94 mph and can reach back for 96 after topping out at 92 in high school. His fading changeup is his best secondary weapon and highly effective against left-handed hitters because he throws it with convincing arm speed from the same slot as his fastball. PERSON's curveball has good depth and he can use it to get whiffs, but it currently lacks the velocity and bite needed to be a true out-pitch at the highest level. PERSON's athleticism and high three-quarters slot help him throw strikes consistently and keep his pitches down in the zone, and his command should continue to improve as he develops physically and gains upper-level experience. Scouts believe he's just scraping the surface of his potential, with the final product being that of a Nos. 3 or 4 starter.",0
"A year after taking PERSON from the college hitting ranks, the ORGANIZATION went that route again in selecting PERSON from GPE in the first round. The right-handed hitter was one of the best college power bats in the GPE class. He has plus power to all fields, though there are some holes to his swing that lead to a fair amount of strikeouts. He's played both third and first in the past. PERSON's plus arm would be just fine at third, but many feel with his limited range (not to mention being blocked by PERSON), first base might be a better long-term home. He might be athletic enough to play right field as well, where his arm and his power bat might profile well.",1
"When PERSON became the first ORGANIZATION Division I team in 21 years to win a regional tournament in its playoff debut last June, PERSON was named Most Outstanding Player after picking up two victories in the four days. He followed up with a strong summer in the ORGANIZATION and has performed well again this spring.PERSON can hit 94 mph with his fastball, but he usually pitches at 88-92 mph. He lacks downhill plane because he's 6 feet tall and leaves his heater up in the strike zone more than he should, but it's effective because his extreme crossfire delivery produces run and sink and allows him to get inside against righties.PERSON's breaking ball varies between a fringy slider in the lower 80s and a promising cutter in the upper 80s, and he may want to focus on the cutter in pro ball. His changeup has some sink and is an effective third pitch. He throws enough strikes to remain a starter, though his lack of a true plus pitch gives him little margin for error.",0
"ORGANIZATION hasn't had a pitcher selected in the top two rounds since the ORGANIZATION took PERSON 50th overall in 1993. ORGANIZATION certainly looked like he could end that trend in 2014, but PERSON surgery left his immediate future somewhat in doubt.    When healthy, ORGANIZATION usually deals fastballs at 91-93 mph and has reached as high as 95, and the pitch plays up because it has nice life and he can locate it where he wants. His low-80s slider can be inconsistent but should give him a second plus pitch down the road. He also shows flashes of having a useful changeup.   It's easy to look at ORGANIZATION's skinny frame and call him projectable, though he has added little weight or fastball velocity in two-plus years at ORGANIZATION. When he gets tired, he tends to drop his three-quarters arm slot, and his pitches flatten out. Any team that takes him will obviously need to exhibit patience as he rehabs from his elbow surgery.",1
"PERSON GPE (ORGANIZATION, PERSON) sent future big leaguer PERSON and PERSON winner PERSON to PERSON A&M, and PERSON seemed to be headed down the same path. But he has blossomed this spring into the best left-handed prep pitching prospect in the state, so he might go high enough in the GPE to turn down the Aggies.PERSON could have three solid or better pitches when he's fully developed. He currently operates with an 87-91 mph fastball and should work in the low 90s once he fills out his lanky frame. He has advanced secondary stuff for a high schooler, with a tumbling changeup that earns plus grades at times and a curveball with depth that needs more power.PERSON's athleticism and feel for pitching are two more points in his favor. One of the more projectable pitchers in the GPE, he could turn into a 2020 first-rounder if he decides to attend college.",0
"GPE seniors have done well with the new Draft rules as teams try to find ways to strategically use their bonus pools. PERSON has the chance to be the first senior to come off the board in 2014.Originally a two-way player who played third base for the ORGANIZATION, PERSON started focusing on pitching only as a junior in 2013. He's really taken off this season, showing a jump in velocity up into the mid 90s with plenty of sink. His slider has greatly improved, flashing as a plus pitch. His changeup is behind the other two, but he has shown some feel for it. The focus on pitching has helped his command, and he's able to pitch to both sides of the plate.There is some effort to his delivery, but not enough to make a team think he can't start. GPE seniors typically are value picks, but PERSON has the chance to go in the early rounds based on his size and stuff alone.",0
"We don't trust PERSON's ORGANIZATION league numbers (.330/.386/.541, 12% K% at age 20) because of the hitting environment, but we also don't want to undersell his physical ability. This is a plus runner with plus bat speed who is also tough to strike out because he has good hand-eye coordination. However, PERSON has balance and swing path issues at the plate that limit the quality of his contact in certain parts of the zone. Once he reaches a level of the minors where pitchers can exploit this, he's going to have to make an adjustment. If he can do that, his ceiling is significant, because he has rare ability. We'd just like to see the signs that he can. ",0
"In the first 51 years of the GPE, only eight high school second basemen have been selected in the first or the supplemental first round. The most recent is PERSON, who went 35th overall in 2014 and earned a $2 million bonus because he offered one of the best bat and speed combinations in that year's crop. Both of those tools translated immediately to pro ball, as PERSON hit .295 with 43 steals in 144 games against much older competition during his first two pro seasons, though his numbers have declined in high Class A this year. He has an advanced feel for hitting and and hits line drives to all fields, but his command of the strike zone hasn't been as strong as usual in 2016. While PERSON is not a big guy, he has impressive bat speed and could develop double-digit home run power once he matures physically.PERSON's well-above-average speed makes him dangerous on the bases, though he's still learning the nuances of stealing. The biggest concern with him remains his arm, which hasn't bounced all the way back since he had surgery to repair a torn labrum in 2011. The Rockies are confident that PERSON's arm will be playable and that he can become an average defender at second base, with center field a possible fallback.",0
"Selected in the second round of the 2013 Draft, PERSON hit .371 during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION and then claimed the LOCATION batting title the following year in his full-season debut, batting .340 as a 19-year-old at ORGANIZATION A Delmarva. He hit over .300 again in the ORGANIZATION in 2015 and received a late-season promotion to Double-A GPE, where he was more than four years younger than the average player in the LOCATION. PERSON has continued to hit up a storm this season in his return to GPE, and he announced himself to a national audience when he homered in the ORGANIZATION Game in July. PERSON has already proven to be an advanced hitter for his age, demonstrating excellent feel for the strike zone and an approach which caters to his use of the whole field. He makes a lot of contact with a clean left-handed stroke and never tries to do too much at the plate. He's shown a more discerning eye as he's moved up the ladder, leading to perennially high on-base percentages and walk rates across his first four seasons. Although PERSON had a few more balls leave the yard in 2015, he profiles as more of a doubles hitter with below-average over-the-fence pop.PERSON has good arm strength but otherwise is raw behind the plate. He's worked hard to improve his footwork and catch-and-throw skills in the last year, and scouts have become less skeptical about whether he can develop the chops to be an everyday backstop. The ORGANIZATION have challenged PERSON since Day One, and the fact that he had significant Double-A experience entering his age-21 season speaks to his track record of surpassing expectations.",1
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON out of the ORGANIZATION back in October 2013, and he made steady progress at the developmental levels en route to his first taste of full-season ball in 2016. He was overmatched at ORGANIZATION A Advanced ORGANIZATION the next year but showed more power and consistency after a demotion to ORGANIZATION A Hagerstown. Taking another crack at ORGANIZATION in 2018, PERSON was hitting .386/.411/.659 in the ORGANIZATION before a broken finger suffered in early May disrupted his breakout campaign. Once viewed as a slap hitter with minimal impact potential at the plate, PERSON has since tacked on considerable muscle to his frame. With that improved strength has come a more leveraged swing and an emphasis on driving the ball in the air, something he did nearly 10 percent better last season than 2017. What's more, PERSON was able to make those adjustments while making gains in his approach and improving his strikeout and walk rates. A plus runner who played mostly center field early in his career, PERSON has wheels that now grade out more as above-average, and he's settled in as an average defender who can handle either right or left field. Those positions, of course, come with greater offensive demands, so PERSON will need to hit for both average and power all the way up the ladder to profile as a regular in the Majors.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 28, 2017 - PERSON, Fla.Favorite MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON TroutWith a 2016 ORGANIZATION and seven All-Tournament Teams in two years, PERSON has impressed as a prospect in the class of 2017. He participated in the 2016 ORGANIZATION and is committed to the LOCATION. A right-handed pitcher with an athletic build, PERSON is composed on the mound and has confidence in his ability to get outs. He is still growing, but his athleticism and arm speed give him a chance to have future success.The youngster boasts a fastball that sits at 90 mph and has control down in the zone. He also flashes a future average curveball at 81 mph, and the pitch has late break.",0
"After a month and a half of ORGANIZATION games, PERSON decided to push little PERSON to the ORGANIZATION for the season's final month, and his numbers there were almost exactly the same. He was the most naturally-gifted hitter in the ORGANIZATION last year, a switch-hitter with sublime bat control and more power than one would expect a 150-pound 17-year-old to possess. He's going to stay up the middle, either at shortstop or second base, and while he's not an obviously desirable teenage prospect like most big-framed, 6-foot-3 types with power would be, this is exactly the kind of profile we're seeking to identify earlier in the process. This is what several of the little middle infielders in our top 50 looked like at this age; they hit and played good defense somewhere important, but were literally overlooked because they were small.",0
"When PERSON first joined the ORGANIZATION organization, signed back in 2008 out of GPE, he was a thin, awkward, Bambi-like teenager who could really defend and barely hit. While he's still a glove-first shortstop, PERSON has matured considerably into a guy ready to play in the big leagues.PERSON did just that during his Major League debut in 2015, filling in for the injured PERSON for nearly all of September. While he's never going to have much power, PERSON has added enough strength to show the bat won't be knocked out of his hands by high-level pitching, making consistent line-drive contact. He's slowed down a tick as he's matured, but he's still a good baserunner who can steal a base. He also has more than enough range and arm to stay at shortstop long term. He's not the flashy type, but will make every play, the kind of infielder you want the ball hit to.PERSON is obviously blocked at short by PERSON, who is under control through 2018. The 24-year-old is ready for another big league opportunity, especially after a strong showing in his home country's winter league.",1
" PERSON doesn't have overpowering stuff, succeeding instead thanks to his command and feel for pitching. He issued 78 walks in his first three professional seasons, averaging 1.7 walks per nine innings. That polish will give him a chance to stick with the Orioles after they selected him from the ORGANIZATION in the 2014 Rule 5 Draft. PERSON's above-average command helps his whole four-pitch arsenal play up. He throws his fastball in the low 90s, and he isn't afraid to come right after hitters with it. His slider is his best secondary offering, and he mixes in a curveball and a changeup as well. PERSON has been susceptible to home runs, partially because he has a tendency to leave his fastball up in the zone. PERSON's upside is limited by his lack of premium stuff. But his overall package give him a chance to fit into the back of a Major League rotation.",0
"PERSON planned on attending the U.S. ORGANIZATION before Nevada-Las PERSON recruited him after he graduated from high school. He took over as the ORGANIZATION' ace in 2014 when PERSON succumbed to PERSON surgery. PERSON (first round, GPE) and PERSON (third round) gave ORGANIZATION its first-ever pair of top-100 picks in the same Draft. Just over a year later, PERSON was dealt to GSP, along with PERSON, for PERSON Utley.While he can't match PERSON's pure stuff, PERSON can throw strikes with four different pitches. He can add and subtract from his fastball, ranging from 86-94 mph and maintaining his velocity deep into games. His heater features run and sink, and he uses his 6-foot-4 frame to leverage it down in the strike zone.PERSON has good feel for his changeup and spins both a curveball and a slider/cutter. He has a clean delivery and works in the strike zone enough to profile as a durable end-of-the-rotation starter.",0
" PERSON reinforced his reputation as one of the best prep hitters available with his performance at the 18-and-under PERSON Championship in GPE last September, leading PERSON to a gold medal by topping the team in nearly every offensive category. He carried that over to the spring and landed as the ORGANIZATION. 15 overall pick in the 2015 Draft.PERSON has an unusual left-handed swing with a golf-style grip, but he makes repeated hard contact with his short stroke and above-average bat speed. Factor in his considerable strength and he should have at least average power. He also adds value on the bases with his solid speed and keen instincts. While he's not a true burner, PERSON has a chance to stay in center field as a pro. Left field would be his likely fallback position and he should have enough bat to profile there if needed.",1
"After winning ORGANIZATION accolades at the World Junior Championships in 2010, PERSON was set to sign with the ORGANIZATION for $350,000 as a 16-year-old until the ORGANIZATION threatened to ban him from ever playing or coaching in GPE if he signed before graduating from high school. He waited to do so, then broke the bonus record for GPE position players by signing with the ORGANIZATION for $2.05 million in 2012. He seemed headed for obscurity after posting a .614 OPS in his first five pro seasons before breaking out in Double-A this year and helping GPE as a stopgap solution at third base in the Majors.Even when he wasn't producing offensively, PERSON controlled the strike zone well. He still does, and he also has become more selectively aggressive and tries to drive the ball on occasion. His plus speed remains his best tool, though it never has translated into much in the way of stolen bases.A versatile defender, PERSON has seen action at shortstop, second base, third base and center field. With his quickness, average arm and offensive profile, he's best suited for the middle infield. He has given the ORGANIZATION a lift at the hot corner and could have a future as a utilityman if he continues to hold his own at the plate.",1
"PERSON tied a GPE high school record with 25 homers in 2011 before attending ORGANIZATION, where he played three positions in three years. After moving from third base to catcher to shortstop, he signed for $200,000 as a sixth-rounder in 2014 and played all three positions (as well as second base) in his pro debut. The ORGANIZATION made PERSON a full-time catcher and will keep him there going forward. There's no doubt that PERSON has the tools and the makeup to stick behind the plate. He has a strong arm and has worked to streamline his release, which helped him throw out 34 percent of basestealers in 2015. PERSON has sure hands and also has made progress improving his receiving and blocking skills.PERSON wore down physically and his offense suffered as a result during his lone season as a college catcher, but he managed the workload better last year. He makes consistent contact and has power in his compact right-handed stroke, but he won't be productive at the plate until he implements a more disciplined approach.",0
"  The PERSON drafted PERSON, a well-polished workhorse starter out of ORGANIZATION, in the second round in 2013. He began his first full professional season with PERSON, where he made the ORGANIZATION State PERSON All-Star Game and earned a late-summer promotion to Double-A Jacksonville. Most of his second full season was spent back in GPE, and the was traded to the ORGANIZATION in October while pitching in the ORGANIZATION in return for PERSON PERSON has the look of a power pitcher, and his fastball has been clocked up to 96 mph. But he more typically works in the low 90s and locates his fastball well. He's cleaned up his delivery in the ORGANIZATION, allowing him to pitch down in the zone more often, limiting home runs and creating plenty of groundball outs. He added a slider to his arsenal in 2014, giving him another offspeed pitch to go with his curveball and changeup.PERSON has handled aggressive assignments with aplomb so far, earning a late promotion to Triple-A in 2015. His combination of stuff and pitchability could allow him to be a back-end starter in the big leagues in the near future.",1
"GPE colleges are always well-scouted, but it's rare when a game at that level in GPE brings in cross-checkers and scouting directors. That's what happened when PERSON's Polk State played PERSON's ORGANIZATION of GPE Manatee-Sarasota. By many accounts, PERSON outpitched GPE, putting him much more firmly on the GPE prospect map.In that game, and for much of the season, PERSON showed excellent arm strength and a good, clean delivery. He can maintain his velocity, as he did by still touching 95 mph in the seventh inning against GPE and sitting 90-95 mph throughout his starts. His slider can be an out pitch, though he doesn't always throw it enough. He employs a curveball to get ahead early in counts, and while some have seen a changeup in bullpen sessions, he doesn't use one in games. PERSON wasn't as sharp late in the season, pitching out of the stretch in the state tournament as he was nursing a sprained ankle. A team that believes the right-hander they saw in GPE is the real deal could take him in the top five rounds.",0
"FACILITY PERSON seemed like the ORGANIZATION' version of PERSON, signing for $500,000 in November 2010 but not getting cleared to play until March 2012 because he had presented differing identities and birthdates during the signing process. He built more anticipation by blowing away Rookie-level ORGANIZATION hitters with a fastball that approaches 100 mph, and he did the same when he finally made his GPE debut at the start of 2013.When FACILITY PERSON got promoted to high Class A last June, however, he learned that he'll need more than sheer velocity to succeed at higher levels. He continued to average 93-94 mph with his fastball, but he got smoked to the tune of a 6.06 ERA because he had nothing else to help him survive.FACILITY PERSON has a rough delivery and struggles to repeat it, which compromises his secondary pitches and his ability to locate his offerings. He can run his slider up to 85 mph but it lacks consistency, and he has yet to show much feel for a changeup. He'll profile as a reliever unless he can add a lot of polish.",0
"PERSON became the sixth PERSON drafted in the first round and the first in nine years when the ORGANIZATION selected him 28th overall in 2009. He didn't spend much time in the ORGANIZATION system, however, as he was a part of the package sent to GPE for PERSON in December 2010. PERSON' stock had gone down since he was drafted, but his strong season while repeating Double-A PERSON this year has restored some of his prospect sheen. PERSON stands out most for his athleticism. He has well above-average speed and covers a lot of ground in center field. Offensively, PERSON has the tools to become a prototypical leadoff hitter. He has a line-drive approach and uses his speed to his advantage. PERSON is still just 22, giving him time to reach his potential.",1
"PERSON thought PERSON could be a quick-moving college bat when he was coming out of ORGANIZATION in 2012, and so far, he's proved them right. The D-backs will hope that continues after they acquired him in the deal that sent PERSON to the Brewers at the 2014 PERSON. PERSON's quick bat produces plenty of raw power. There will always be some swing-and-miss in his game, but his approach at the plate has improved and he squares up balls well.PERSON was a center fielder in college and has spent some time there as a professional. As an everyday player, however, he profiles best in right field, where his arm is an asset.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the first round of the 2014 Draft -- a bit of a surprise to some -- they knew it might require some patience to watch this extremely projectable shortstop develop. Shoulder surgery to repair a torn labrum during his first full season certainly slowed him, but did nothing to dampen the organization's enthusiasm about who PERSON can become.The further PERSON gets removed from the surgery, the better his arm is at shortstop. He's completely pain-free, though his throws don't quite have the carry yet that they did before the injury. His range and hands all still work extremely well at shortstop. His speed works on both sides of the ball, and he's starting to master the art of stealing a base. PERSON continues to make progress as a switch-hitter, getting more natural left-handed than right-handed because of all the reps he's taken. He's hit over power, but the strength in the bat is coming as he fills out. He's more upright in his stance and learning to leverage the ball more. Increased recognition of off-speed stuff and improved plate discipline will only enhance his offensive profile.Still a bit of a baby giraffe, PERSON has started to grow into his man strength and become a solid all-around shortstop. His makeup and personality are what they feel separate him and will allow him to reach his still enormous potential.",1
"After sitting in the mid-80s with his fastball as a sophomore, PERSON caught scouts' attention by touching the mid-90s last spring at ORGANIZATION (PERSON, Kan.). He continued to light up radar guns on the showcase circuit during the summer and fall, cementing his status as part of ORGANIZATION' best high school talent crop ever. The ORGANIZATION State never has had more than one player selected in the first rounds in a ORGANIZATION, but could have four in the top two or three rounds this year in pitchers PERSON, PERSON and PERSON plus shortstop PERSON Williams.Despite spending the winter starring in basketball (he averaged 16 points per game and earned second-team all-state recognition) rather than focusing on preparing for baseball, PERSON hit 95 mph in his first start as well as his last, a playoff loss to the ORGANIZATION's top-rated right-hander, PERSON. PERSON bore a heavy workload and pitched at 88-90 mph with some running life for most of this spring. With his projection and athleticism, the ORGANIZATION recruit could throw consistently in the mid-90s one day, though that may require some adjustments to his mechanics.PERSON has a short arm action that causes him to get under his pitches and flatten them out. He'll show some power and shape with his slurvy breaking ball, which could become a solid or perhaps better slider with more consistency. While he doesn't have much of a changeup yet and requires more overall polish, his arm strength and big, athletic frame give him a high ceiling.",0
"  PERSON was one of the top two-way players in the college ranks leading up to the 2014 First-Year Player Draft. In addition to playing right field and hitting in the middle of the order for PERSON, he also pitched out of the Titans bullpen. PERSON' fastball got up to the mid 90s, and he saved seven games for PERSON in 2014. But thanks to his powerufl bat, professional scouts liked him more as a hitter. He controls the strike zone well and could hit for a solid average to go with his pop. After playing several positions during his college career, PERSON has settled at third base as a professional. He's made progress at his new position and has already shown that he could move quickly in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"GPE PERSON's PERSON isn't the only Houston-area pitcher who has vaulted into first-round consideration. PERSON was well known to scouts before this spring, but his projectability stood out more than his present stuff and most figured he wouldn't get drafted early enough to divert him from a Texas A&M commitment. That changed when he hit 97 mph in his first appearance of the year, a February scrimmage against PERSON and highly touted right-hander PERSON, and he hasn't looked back since.PERSON has gotten noticeably stronger, adding at least 10 pounds to his 6-foot-2 frame, and dropped his arm slot from high three-quarters to three-quarters. Those changes have increased the velocity and movement on his fastball, which previously sat around 90 mph but has ranged from 90-97 with armside run all spring. His curveball can overmatch hitters as well, residing in the low 80s with 12-6 break when he stays on top of it.Though PERSON's changeup isn't as effective as his other two pitches, he'll flash some solid ones with fade and tumble. He already shows the aptitude to work both sides of the plate and all four quadrants of the strike zone. He still has the room to add another 15 pounds and scouts rave about his makeup, so he could continue to get better.",0
"PERSON has extensive baseball bloodlines. His father PERSON played 11 years in the big leagues and is a Triple-A hitting coach in the ORGANIZATION system, and his cousin PERSON is an All-Star infielder with the ORGANIZATION. His oldest brother (PERSON) starred at ORGANIZATION, reached Triple-A and now scouts for the ORGANIZATION; another brother (GPE) played briefly in the ORGANIZATION system; and his youngest brother (GPE) is the top prep position player in ORGANIZATION this year, though scouts think he'd be best off following PERSON and ORGANIZATION's path to the Wildcats.PERSON's offensive upside and athleticism made him a potential second-round pick entering 2016, but he has had a rough year with the bat and glove and is now a wild card. Though he has some of the best bat speed in the LOCATION, he has swung through hittable fastballs and looked hopeless at times against offspeed pitches. He's still working deep counts and drawing walks, but he's swinging and missing too much to get the most out of his plus raw power.After playing second base in his first two years at ORGANIZATION, PERSON has moved to third base as a junior. He has the quickness and arm strength for the position, but lacks infield actions and has been erratic at the hot corner. He may have to move to right field in pro ball, which would put more pressure on his bat.",0
"PERSON got rocked for a 9.45 GPE as a 17-year-old in GPE's top league in 2011-12 but made a decent impression in a workout facing other GPE defectors, earning a $40,000 bonus from the ORGANIZATION in September 2014. A finesse right-hander who has climbed steadily through the system, he led GPE farmhands in GPE (2.04) and strikeouts (146) in 2017 and went a combined 16-2 in Triple-A in 2017-18. He continued to perform well in the ORGANIZATION Winter League during the offseason yet may face a third season in Triple-A.While PERSON only has one pitch that grades better than average, he has thrived because his tumbling changeup and his feel for sequencing and locating his entire repertoire keeps hitters off balance. He changes eye levels with sinking 88-90 mph two-seam fastballs and riding 90-92 mph four-seamers, and he has hit 95 mph at times. His average slider/cutter and fringy curveball rarely buckle knees but he utilizes them well off each other.PERSON falls off the mound toward first base in his delivery, though that provides deception without compromising his ability to throw strikes. He has little margin for error and survives by not making many mistakes. A back-of-the-rotation starter, he has one of the highest floors among the system's pitching prospects but no clear opportunity in GPE.",0
"A three-star quarterback recruit who had offers from mid-level college football programs, PERSON threw for 14 touchdowns in his first four games as a senior last fall but broke his collarbone in the fifth. He missed the first couple weeks of the baseball season this spring but has gotten progressively better since returning in mid-March. If he can be signed away from his ORGANIZATION State commitment, he could go as early as the third round, which would make him ORGANIZATION' highest-drafted prep pitcher since 2011 second-rounder PERSON Howard.PERSON works in the low 90s and reaches 95 mph with life on his fastball, showing a tendency to pick up velocity in the middle innings. For a high schooler who has been divided between two sports, he has a remarkably advanced changeup, throwing it with deceptive arm speed and good velocity separation while imparting sink and fade. While his breaking ball is slurvy at this point, he does have some feel to spin and could have a solid curveball once he tightens it up.A quality athlete with a strong lower half, PERSON throws without effort and repeats his delivery well. He throws strikes and uses his 6-foot-4 frame to create angle on his pitches. If he goes to college and focuses on baseball, he has the potential to develop into a first-rounder in the 2021 Draft.",0
"PERSON pitched sparingly as a GPE freshman in 2013 before transferring to GPE, where he led the LOCATION Conference with 11 wins as a redshirt junior in 2016. Signed for $180,000 as an 11th-rounder that summer, he didn't allow an earned run during his brief pro debut and has exceeded expectations in his first full pro season. He earned a promotion to high Class A in mid-May and forced his way into PERSON's rotation three weeks later. PERSON's best trait is his command of a 91-94 mph fastball that tops out at 96. He backs it up with an improving curveball that shows signs of becoming a consistently solid second offering. His changeup lags behinds his other two pitches, though he has handled left-handed hitters well so far.After looking like he might move quickly as a reliever, PERSON will remain a starter for now. He's not the most physical pitcher, but he's so efficient that he can work deep into games without running up high pitch counts. He projects as a possible innings-eater toward the back of a big league rotation.",0
"PERSON cruised through the lower Minors with relative ease but battled more adversity than ever in 2014. He struggled in the first half of the season before pitching better in July and August. His year ended on a sour note when he drew a 50-game suspension that he'll serve in 2015 for testing positive for a stimulant in November.He has everything scouts look for in a pitcher -- stuff, size and command -- and, as a bonus, he's left-handed. PERSON throws a low-90s two-seam fastball with minimal effort, topping out at 95 while getting the ball to cut or sink and locating it where he wants.PERSON's slider can reach the mid 80s with good bite when it's on, and it can get slurvy when it's not. His changeup features good sink when he doesn't throw it too hard. He has a ceiling of a No. 3 starter and will reach it if his secondary pitches become more consistent.",1
"The ORGANIZATION have long been active on the international amateur player market and the 2019-20 signing period has proven to be no different. The organization handed out seven six-figures or better bonuses at the start of the new signing period, a group topped by PERSON. The talented outfielder was ranked No. 8 on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 international prospects list and got $2.5 million to sign.PERSON has the potential to have above-average tools across the board, profiling as a center fielder right now, but he could end up at one of the corner outfield spots in the future. Athletic with a strong body and medium frame, PERSON has shown a solid hitting approach and advanced knowledge of the strike zone for a player his age. He has an efficient swing that creates lots of backspin and generates power to all fields. He also has a real feel and natural instincts for the game and specifically, hitting.PERSON can cover some ground in the outfield. He has a strong arm with excellent actions that could make him a plus defender in the future. He also runs the timed 60-yard run in 6.5 seconds and is a smart baserunner. Overall, he's reminded some of a young PERSON, who was drafted by the ORGANIZATION out of GPE back in 2010.",0
" PERSON needed just one year at ORGANIZATION after transferring from LSU-Eunice to establish himself as the best catcher in the ORGANIZATION. He capped off his junior season by winning the PERSON, given to the top college catcher in the country. PERSON excels defensively, earning high marks for his plus arm, footwork and receiving skills. Some thought he was the best defensive catcher in this year's Draft. His offense, however, is not as well regarded. PERSON is a patient hitter and regularly puts the ball in play, but scouts worry he doesn't make hard contact consistently enough. PERSON's defense and makeup are enough to set his floor as a backup and if he can improve his hitting, he could fill a much larger role in the ORGANIZATION.",0
" When evaluating where PERSON is on the development path, it's important to note that GPE is not a very nice place to hit. Just ask PERSON, who hit zero homers in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League at age 21. PERSON, the Wyoming native who didn't have a high school baseball team, hit six as a raw teenager. There's a lot of raw power to tap into for PERSON and as he continues to refine his approach, he should have at least above-average pop in games. He does understand the strike zone quite well, so he should hit for average as well. A solid average runner, PERSON has a good arm and while he has work to do to stay in center field, should be an average defender across the board. The ORGANIZATION knew it might take PERSON some time to develop given his experience, but in many ways he's ahead of the curve.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1
" PERSON starred at ORGANIZATION State for three years before the ORGANIZATION selected him in the third round of the 2011 Draft, making him the highest drafted position player in school history. He has a patient approach at the plate and understands the strike zone well. He is still susceptible to strikeouts, however, as his swing has a tendency to get long. PERSON produces good power and looks to drive balls into the gaps. PERSON has improved defensively since joining the professional ranks and is now solid at third base. He has a strong arm and good hands. PERSON has rebounded this season at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Lynchburg, reclaiming his prospect status after a disappointing full-season debut in 2012.",0
"PERSON pitched just 53 2/3 innings in four years of college split between PERSON and PERSON, and he missed all of 2013 following PERSON surgery. Yet the ORGANIZATION saw enough to draft him in the 31st round in 2014 and signed him for $50,000. Barely a year after turning pro, he reached high Class A. Strictly a reliever, PERSON works primarily with two pitches. His fastball sits at 92-94 mph and touches 96, playing up thanks to its late movement, and his hard slider also misses bats. He has begun working on a changeup to give hitters something offspeed to think about, though it's very much a work in progress.PERSON had problems finding the strike zone at times in college, but his control and command have been much more impressive early in his pro career. At the rate he's progressing, he could bolster the GPE bullpen in the near future. He has a ceiling of a set-up man.",0
" The excitement of signing PERSON away from what appeared to be an unbreakable commitment to the ORGANIZATION of GPE came to a crashing halt when he tore his left meniscus just 15 games into his professional career. With youth and a very advanced bat on his side, he should be able to get going again, assuming health. PERSON is a switch-hitter with a natural ability to hit from both sides of the plate. He should hit for average and above-average power when all is said and done, the kind of bat that will fit nicely into the middle of the lineup. PERSON was settling into right field as a pro before the injury, and he has the tools to be an above-average defender with a strong arm, not to mention the offensive tools, to profile well there.",1
" After drafting right-hander PERSON in the first round in 2014, the ORGANIZATION took PERSON, another polished college pitcher, in the second round. As they did with PERSON, the ORGANIZATION challenged PERSON during his professional debut, and he handled the assignment to Class A Lakewood well. He made just two starts at the next level to start the 2015 season before a shoulder problem landed him on the disabled list, though he did return two months later.PERSON has a solid three-pitch mix and a good feel for pitching. He throws his fastball in the upper 80s to low 90s. The pitch plays up, thanks to its natural cutting action and the downhill angle he throws from. His breaking ball can be an out pitch, and he also mixes in a changeup. Though PERSON doesn't have premium stuff, he was one of the top strikeout pitchers in the country as a junior at ORGANIZATION. If he can rediscover that success in the ORGANIZATION, he could start advancing quickly.",0
"The ORGANIZATION thought they were getting a bat-first backstop when they took GPE as a Draft-eligible sophomore out of GPE in the ORGANIZATION B in 2016. A solid first full season that saw him play across two levels of A ball has further cemented that evaluation. After reaching Double-A for the first time, the ORGANIZATION dealt him with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION Deadline.GPE showed, at least during his time with GPE in the LOCATION, that his power will play. That's particularly true from the left side of the plate, where his pop is at least average, but he has 45 power from the right side as well. There is some swing and miss, but he's also willing to be selective in waiting for a pitch to drive. The ORGANIZATION hadn't worked much with launch angle previously, but they are shifting some focus in that direction and that should help GPE, who has always been about lifting the ball. His defense remains behind the bat and while he has a long way to go, he's made progress and worked hard behind the plate. He'll never wow anyone back there, but there is confidence he'll be capable enough to stay there. That gives him the chance to be a switch-hitting, offensive-minded big league regular catcher with power. What team wouldn't want that kind of player?",0
"PERSON started the ORGANIZATION all-star game in 2014, highlighting a summer in which he positioned himself as a likely first-round candidate for the 2015 Draft. He struggled early that spring before rallying late in the season and going in the second round to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON broke down over concerns about his elbow, so he returned to GPE for his senior season, during which he started slowly but finished strong once again.PERSON's stuff has looked pretty much the same as it did a year ago. He has one of the better fastballs among college starters, working at 92-95 mph and hitting 98. He generates easy velocity with a 6-foot-7, 245-pound frame that also creates difficult angle and plane on his pitches.His slurvy breaking ball has been a little less sharp this spring, though PERSON shows a solid low-80s slider when he stays on top of the pitch. He rarely employs his changeup but has shown some decent feel for it in the past. He throws enough strikes and has a ceiling of a workhorse starter, though some scouts think his inconsistent command means he'll have more success as a high-leverage reliever.",0
"PERSON is the hardest-throwing and most intimidating pitcher in the 2015 high school class. The 6-foot-7 left-hander hit 96 mph at the ORGANIZATION Games, 97 at the ORGANIZATION All-American Classic and 95 at the Under PERSON All-America Game.PERSON sat in the low 90s with his fastball as a junior and figures to add more velocity as he adds strength to his ultra-tall frame. He throws from a lower arm slot, creating difficult angle and adding life to his pitches. His secondary pitches lack consistency, but his curveball features impressive depth at times and his changeup shows promise as well.While he has a huge ceiling, some scouts believe PERSON's work-in-progress secondary pitches and command and his delivery may have him destined for the bullpen. A product of athletic powerhouse PERSON -- the alma mater of ORGANIZATION running back PERSON, ORGANIZATION slam dunk champion PERSON, soccer star PERSON and big league catcher PERSON, among others -- has committed to ORGANIZATION.",0
"His brother PERSON was a first-round pick of the Indians in 2014, and GPE looked like he'd go that early the year before until he had PERSON surgery. The ORGANIZATION made a strong run at him after selecting him in the 13th round, but he turned them down to attend PERSON, where he redshirted in 2014. GPE returned last year to play a key swingman role as the ORGANIZATION finished second at the ORGANIZATION World Series, then he showed the best pure stuff in the ORGANIZATION during the summer.Of all the pitching prospects in the 2016 Draft, GPE may have the best chance to develop three plus offerings. His fastball can sit at 94-96 mph and reach 98, and he has maintained his velocity in the late innings of his starts. Both GPE's hard three-quarters breaking ball (which is more likely to become a slider than a curveball) and his circle changeup can be out pitches at times, helping him challenge for the LOCATION strikeout lead while fashioning a 32-inning streak without allowing an earned run this spring.All that said, GPE does come with concerns. His combination of explosive stuff and small stature draws PERSON and PERSON comparisons, but his size and his medical history lead to concerns about his durability as a starter. So does the effort in GPE's delivery, as he often overthrows and has yet to prove he can find the strike zone on a consistent basis.",0
"The jump to Double-A is thought of as a huge separator for prospects. PERSON, whose older brother PERSON is a third baseman in the GPE system, learned that the hard way when the ORGANIZATION double-jumped him from the Class A ORGANIZATION to the LOCATION in 2015.PERSON found out that hitters at that level will make you pay if you make a mistake, and he made plenty of them in 2015, giving up more than 12 hits per nine innings in the process. The right-hander's bread and butter is his heavy sinker that generates a ton of ground-ball outs, though he is still learning to command it. His secondary stuff, a slider and changeup, are inconsistent, with not enough separation between any of them.For PERSON to remain a starter, he'll need to find a way to differentiate his pitches to keep hitters more off-balance. If not, he could be an effective sinker-slider reliever who sees an uptick in velocity in shorter stints and gets called upon when a ground ball is needed.",0
"The son of former ORGANIZATION left-hander PERSON, PERSON signed with the GPE in July 2011. He made a splash in the ORGANIZATION during his GPE debut the following year, but he has struggled in two stints in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON stands out for his bat, and he has the ability to be an above-average hitter. His quick hands and compact swing enable him to make a lot of contact. PERSON is a slightly above-average runner, and he has shown some power, but how much he develops will depend on how he fills out his wiry frame.Originally a shortstop, the GPE moved PERSON to the outfield this year. He has played primarily left field, and he's responded to the change well.",0
"We think the slight uptick in PERSON's walk rate last year could just have been caused by an increased focus on changeup usage. His swinging strike rate took a dip when he reached Double-A despite having two clearly plus pitches: an upper-90s sinker and a curveball. It's possible the two didn't pair well together and that a better changeup, or a third pitch, will be needed in order to miss bats. PERSON's changeup did improve throughout 2018, but he walked more guys; we think that aspect of his profile will bounce back once development isn't coloring his pitch usage. 
PERSON avoided the DL all year after dealing with various injuries during each of the last three seasons. He projects as an above-average big leaguer starter who misses an average number of bats.",1
"GPE's .413 batting average and 8 percent strikeout rate as a St. PERSON's River (Fla.) CC sophomore in 2015 drew the attention of the ORGANIZATION' analytical staff and an impressive pre-Draft workout sold their scouts, so they signed him for $100,000 as a 12th-rounder. A mediocre pro debut relegated him to extended spring training at the start of 2016, but once he got into games he led the Minors in hitting at .358. He encored by batting .290, ranking third in the Minors with 94 walks and reaching Double-A last season.A scout who really believes in GPE could slap at least plus grades on four of his five tools, yet there's still concern whether he can make enough impact at the plate to merit regular playing time in the big leagues. He's a right-handed hitter with an extreme opposite-field approach that has yielded plenty of singles but just two homers in his first three years as a pro. He may not draw nearly as many walks in the Majors if pitchers have no reason to fear challenging him.GPE's best tool is his plus-plus speed and he did a better job of parlaying it into stolen bases last year. His quickness also plays in center field, giving him plenty of range and making him one of the system's better defenders. He has a plus arm that fits anywhere in the outfield and worked out at shortstop during instructional league last fall.",1
"The bat is what really stands out for this LOCATION high school first baseman. With a terrific approach at the plate and a loose swing, he gets advanced marks for his hittability.Right now, PERSON is more of a hit machine, an ORGANIZATION type, than one who will wow you with his power. There is some pop there, and how high he goes on GPE day may depend on just how much power a team thinks he'll have in the future.He's a very solid defender at first, though it's the fact that some see him as the best pure high school hitter in the class that will get him drafted in the early stages of the GPE.",1
"The ORGANIZATION made O'Brien the second-highest pick ever out of Bethune-Cookman when they took him in the third round in 2011, but he opted to transfer to PERSON rather than sign. He went in the second round a year later as a senior, and he has demonstrated consistent power since turning pro. O'Brien led the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League with 10 homers in his pro debut in '12, topped the ORGANIZATION' system with 22 in his first full season in '13 and was third in the Minors with 33 at the time of the 2014 PERSON deal that sent him to GPE for PERSON's raw pop ranks among the best in the Minors, and he can crush the ball out of any part of any ballpark with his combination of bat speed and strength. He hit the longest measured homer during the 2013 ORGANIZATION season, a 455-foot blast. O'Brien does swing and miss a lot, and he doesn't control the strike zone well, so there's some concern as to how much he'll be able to hit for average and tap into his power against more advanced pitchers.There are defensive concerns with O'Brien, as well. He has raw arm strength, though he needs to quicken his transfer and release, and scouts question whether he can refine his receiving and stay behind the plate. O'Brien has seen time at third base and in the outfield, but his lack of speed and quickness may leave first base as his only realistic fallback.",0
"At ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, GPE) in 2015, scouts flocked to see two-way star PERSON and barely noticed PERSON, a short right-hander working in the upper 80s during his first season as a full-time pitcher. They've teamed up in college at ORGANIZATION, where PERSON continues to draw plenty of interest as a slugger and PERSON has opened eyes as a power-armed closer. He set a school record and finished second in ORGANIZATION Division I with 17 saves as a sophomore last year, then opened 2018 with 13 straight scoreless outings.PERSON's velocity jumped in the spring of his freshman year at ORGANIZATION and he now operates at 95-97 mph and peaks at 99 with some running life. His power slider gives him a second well above-average pitch at times, arriving in the mid-80s with some depth. He even can mix in a decent changeup on occasion.Because PERSON lacks size and features effort in his delivery, he's purely a reliever. PERSON strong and durable, he has taken a step forward with his control and command this year. Intelligent and competitive on the mound, he projects as a possible setup man or closer.",0
"Thought to be one of the best college pitching prospects at the start of the 2015 season, PERSON slumped late in the year, causing him to slide to the ORGANIZATION at ORGANIZATION. 35 overall. He opted to return to GPE for his senior year rather than sign and struggled for much of the 2016 season. This time around, though, he bounced back late and landed in the fourth round, getting a $750,000 bonus, more than $200,000 above pick value.PERSON worked at 92-94 mph, touching as high as 97 mph for much of his junior season, but was down to 88-92 mph with a slider that wasn't as sharp and a changeup that wasn't as effective as it had been in the past, and he struggled with command, something that was an issue at times in his college career. Some chalked up the regression of his stuff to slower arm speed, but that rebounded down the stretch, and some scouts felt he was throwing better than he ever had at the end of his senior campaign.If the Tigers can harness the PERSON that showed up for most of 2015 and at the very end of 2016, they might have a mid-rotation starter, and a fourth-round bargain, on their hands.",0
"GPE by bad ORGANIZATION luck in 2018 (.226), PERSON's repeat tour of Double-A PERSON looked discouraging on paper. He still managed to pound out 27 homers, though, and he remains a strong power/lift/plate discipline prospect who could perform at the big league level soon. Players like this sometimes have seasons in excess of 2 WAR but are generally the type who bounce around the fringes of active rosters, like C.J. PERSON or PERSON.",1
"PERSON played briefly in GPE's top league as a teenager before defecting in November 2014 and getting declared a free agent by PERSON Baseball six months later. The ORGANIZATION thought they had a deal done with him for $2.5 million, but before it was finalized, the ORGANIZATION swooped in and landed him for a $3 million bonus and matching overage tax penalty. His tools were evident during his 2016 pro debut in low Class A, and so was his rust after a two-year layoff.Though PERSON has a quick right-handed stroke and feel for the barrel, there are mixed reports on his hitting ability. He got too pull-happy at times last season and while he doesn't swing and miss excessively, his consistency of hard contact needs to improve. GPE believes he'll make adjustments and start to tap into his loft power to his pull side.PERSON's best tool is his arm strength, which earns plus-plus grades from some scouts. His arm and his solid speed allow him to play all three outfield positions, though he's still honing his jumps and routes. His quickness enhances his offensive game as well, as he can bunt for hits and steal some bases but needs to be more aggressive in doing so.",0
"An alumni of the gold-medal winning 18 and under GPE National Team last summer, PERSON is an athletic shortstop with a chance to stay at the premium position.A strong performance at the ORGANIZATION Invitational this spring further helped his ORGANIZATION stock. The ORGANIZATION of GPE commit is a switch-hitter with a projectable body. He's a better hitter from the left side, and while he doesn't have power right now, he does have room to add strength. Still, his best offensive tool will be his speed, which plays well on both sides of the ball. He has the range, hands, arm and instincts to remain at shortstop as well. His defense is ahead of his offense right now, but there is projection in his bat.PERSON won't be the first high school shortstop taken, but he's played his way into early-round consideration.",1
"There are times when college starters get the chance to start in pro ball, but end up in the bullpen. Then there are pitchers like PERSON, who, after three years of effective starting at GPE, has never started a game since the ORGANIZATION took him in the fifth round of the 2015 Draft. It's hard to argue with the results, as PERSON has pitched his way up to Triple-A, saving 64 games in the process after leading the organization in saves in 2017.A big part of PERSON's success is his ability to come at hitters from a variety of arm angles, but to label him as a trickster would be doing his stuff a disservice. He can get his fastball up to 97 mph while throwing it from three different angles with a ton of deception. He uses that fastball and his solid slider to miss a ton of bats, while mixing in an occasional changeup for left-handed hitters. While he mixes things up to disrupt hitters' timing, he repeats well and largely throws strikes.People watch PERSON and figure he's a right-handed specialist or a setup man in the future. But he has the makeup to close games, wanting the ball in the ninth inning, and has better pure stuff than he's given credit for. PERSON, a typical comp for PERSON, didn't close games much in the Minors, but has over 120 saves in the big leagues.",0
"  A bit of a late bloomer, GPE didn't make the varsity team at GPE (Calif.) PERSON until his junior year. Despite his slow start, he established himself as an elite hitter as an amateur, and that carried over to the professional ranks. He excelled as an 18-year-old in the ORGANIZATION in 2014 before the ORGANIZATION acquired him in the three-team trade that sent ORGANIZATION to the Padres.GPE earns some comparisons to PERSON, a fellow GPE alumnus. He barrels up balls well with his short compact swing. GPE has shown some power already, and scouts believe he'll be able to unlock more as he physically matures.Defensively, GPE is limited to first base, where he's a solid defender. It'll be up to his offensive ability to carry him through the ORGANIZATION.",1
"PERSON was a well-known Atlanta-area prep prospect, who in high school was a strong statistical performer with easy plus raw power that showed up in games. He didn't have a clear positional fit as an amateur, and that's still mostly the case now--he was a shortstop in high school but wasn't an athletic fit there, tried catching but it didn't work, and scouts generally projected third base or first base long term. Though he has mostly played third, pro scouts see PERSON as a first base-only type, and he started seeing time there during the 2017 Fall League and again late in 2018. He missed much of 2018 with an 80-game ORGANIZATION suspension, which ominously came after a breakout 2017 campaign during which he hit 31 homers. He has now reached Triple-A, and had a strong half-season after the suspension was up, but scouts are wary of being all-in on a player whose entire profile is dependent on power and has also had a recent ORGANIZATION suspension. One-dimensional hitters who are limited on defense tend to end up in a first base platoon (and in this case, it'd be the lesser side of one) or as a low-end starter like PERSON. Either way, it seems unlikely a high-payroll, contending club like GPE would wait for a young player with limited upside to break in as an everyday player. We think PERSON is a low-end regular and that he may be trade bait once he further establishes his level of performance post-suspension.",1
"The younger brother of GPE catching prospect PERSON, PERSON missed half of his freshman season at ORGANIZATION with a left foot injury and redshirted in what would have been his junior year following labrum surgery on his non-throwing shoulder. He stayed healthy as a fourth-year junior in 2015 and signed with the ORGANIZATION for $100,000 in the 11th round, but sat out that summer after having surgery on his left foot. When PERSON sprained a knee last spring, it gave Heineman the opportunity to make his pro debut in GPE Class A and he made the most of it, batting .303/.386/.505 and leading the GPE League in runs (96), hits (159) and doubles (39) while stealing 30 bases.Heineman's twitchy athleticism and high energy earn him comparisons to PERSON. With his combination of bat speed and strength, he could provide average or better power from the right side of the plate. He still has to prove himself away from the friendly confines of ORGANIZATION and struggled in the ORGANIZATION, but he has some hitting ability and a good eye at the plate.Heineman has solid speed and ranked fifth in the ORGANIZATION, though he won't be as prolific on the bases at higher levels. He has enough range and arm strength to play anywhere in the outfield and saw most of his action in left field last year. He also played third base for the ORGANIZATION and could fill in on either infield corner.",0
"The last of four players whom the ORGANIZATION paid seven-figure bonuses to at the top of the 2015 Draft, PERSON signed for $1.3 million in the fourth round. He drew some Ben Revere comparisons while emerging as PERSON's top high school prospect during the swing.PERSON's game centers around his well above-average speed. He uses a short left-handed stroke to put the ball in play and his quickness to beat out hits. His size and approach result in very little power, however.PERSON has everything necessary to provide quality defense in center field. He reads balls well of the bat, has plenty of range from gap to gap, owns average arm strength and makes accurate throws.",0
"There's nothing like a no-hitter at a Regional to raise your profile a bit. Truth be told, PERSON would be high on radar screens anyway with his pure stuff, though some inconsistent performances during his junior season kept him from being among the top few college pitchers on this list. He has a plus fastball that can touch 96 mph and throws a hard breaking ball to go along with it, a combination he used well for PERSON over the summer. PERSON is strong with a good delivery and arm action. As big as his stuff is, though, he will have to learn to soften it up somehow in the future. Everything he throws is hard, and the ability to change speeds more effectively will be a necessary skill to refine going forward.",0
"The ORGANIZATION traded a pair of prospects in exchange for three international bonus slots to ensure they would sign PERSON, the son of 2004 ORGANIZATION MVP and nine-time All-Star PERSON, during the 2015 international period. He ultimately received a $3.9 million bonus, the second highest in franchise history, and then showcased his huge offensive ceiling last summer in the ORGANIZATION, where, as the league's youngest player, he posted an .808 OPS with eight homers, 46 ORGANIZATION and 15 steals in 62 games. He's been even more impressive this season, earning PERSON All-Star honors at age 18 before an appearance in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON and a subsequent promotion to Class A Advanced Dunedin. Following in the footsteps of his father, PERSON has a preternatural ability to barrel the ball from the right side of the plate and produces effortless raw power to all fields with his combination of bat speed, physical strength and hand-eye coordination. His plate discipline also is impressive, as he walked (33) nearly as often as he fanned (35) during his pro debut. Moved from the outfield to third base ahead before the season, PERSON shows glimpses of becoming an average defender there in spite of having below-average speed and range, and his arm strength has developed into another above-average tool since signing.As a potential above-average hitter with plus power, PERSON boasts the offensive profile of a future All-Star who should spend much of his career hitting in the middle of a big league lineup. However, retaining his athleticism without becoming too bulky could pose as a challenge for PERSON moving forward, and possibly portend a move to the outfield or first base.",1
"The 2018 extended spring rehab group at ORGANIZATION often included PERSON and PERSON. PERSON, still 17 at the time, was just as big as both of them and about as fast as GPE, who is a 60 runner underway. PERSON is a GPE man-child, built like an ORGANIZATION wide receiver and about as fast once he really gets going. He performed fairly well in his first pro season and was pushed to the ORGANIZATION late in the summer. 
He has some swing and miss issues and his bat path needs some work to get to all the power that's coming, but the foundation for a combination of contact and power is present. It's unlikely that PERSON stays in center field forever, and he may even need to move to right while he's still in the minors, but the power that comes with all that good weight could approach the top of the scale. He's a high risk, high upside teenage power-hitting prospect.",0
"PERSON entered the spring as a potential No. 1 pick as one of the top college arms in the class, especially after a sophomore season that saw him lead a Gators staff that included several early 2016 Draft selections and a strong performance for the ORGANIZATION Team last summer. Minor arthroscopic knee surgery kept him from fall ball and that clearly contributed to a sluggish start to his 2017 season, though his stuff came back a bit as the spring progressed.PERSON started the spring closer to the bottom end of his 90-94 mph fastball, but as he got his feet under him, he was sitting 93 mph and touching 95 more consistently with good sink. His slider has continued to look like an out pitch, though some feel he's been throwing it too much. PERSON threw his changeup more over the summer, showing a good feel for it, and it should give him a solid third offering in the future. He tends to be around the zone, though he's more control over command.A slightly uneven junior season has hurt his stock a little bit, but he did throw well in the ORGANIZATION, with his name reappearing in top 10 pick conversations.",0
"While PERSON got more of the ink as a Pirates pitching prospect needing PERSON surgery, PERSON, who got a record $1.2 million bonus in the ninth round of the 2011 Draft, was a recipient of the elbow procedure just a few weeks before PERSON. Before he got hurt, the big right-hander from PERSON had shown the makings of an intriguing three-pitch mix. His fastball will sit in the low 90s, and he throws it with a lot of sink, which generates a lot of groundball outs. His secondary pitches aren't as consistent, but both his curve and his changeup have shown glimpses of being at least PERSON average offerings. PERSON and PERSON rehabbed post-surgery together, pushing each other to get back on the mound in 2015. PERSON doesn't have the ceiling of his organization-mate, but he beat PERSON to the mound, returning in late June.",0
"PERSON's prospect stock peaked when he was a dominant college sophomore at GPE. PERSON and a downtick in stuff plagued him as a junior and he fell to the fifth round of his draft. PERSON has traversed the whole of the minors as a starter but ultimately might fit best in relief due to some of his stuff's limitations. He has a funky, low-slot delivery that creates cuttery, horizontal movement on his slider. It's his best way to miss bats. His changeup and fastball (which was only in the upper-80s for much of his time in the ORGANIZATION) are both fringy on their own but play up a bit due to the deceptive funk in his delivery. PERSON fits in a No. 5 starter/swingman relief role, and could be ready in 2019.",0
"After winning the summer PERSON batting title with a .349 average in 2015, PERSON posted even better numbers as sophomore at ORGANIZATION Charlotte last spring, hitting .384/.461/.555. His bat hasn't been quite as potent this spring, but he still has a chance to become just the second 49ers position player ever drafted in the top five rounds. The first was 1987 Royals third-rounder PERSON, who played briefly in the big leagues.With a quick left-handed bat and good feel for the barrel, PERSON consistently has hit for average. He has an extremely disciplined approach, rarely chasing pitches out of the strike zone and making contact with ease. He has some raw power but his line-drive swing is more conducive to doubles than home runs.An average runner with subpar arm strength, PERSON played left field as a freshman before moving to second base. He has been erratic defensively this year and will have to work to become an average defender at the keystone. His overall package is reminiscent of PERSON's.",0
"The ORGANIZATION used their first overall pick (in the second round) in the 2013 Draft on PERSON, an athletic and projectable right-hander from the ORGANIZATION prep ranks. He was eased into pro ball, spending two seasons in GPE ball before finally advancing to full-season Class A Wisconsin in 2015 and pitching well there. PERSON continued to make strides the following year, reaching the ORGANIZATION State League, but had his entire 2017 campaign wiped out by PERSON surgery that also cost him a portion of the '18 season. After struggling as starter upon his return from a 22-month layoff, PERSON was moved to the bullpen in 2019 and immediately took to the new role, showing improved velocity and a knack for missing bats at ORGANIZATION en route to a Futures Game selection in July. As a starter, PERSON operated with a low-90s fastball and flashed a plus breaking ball. But after tacking on some muscle while recovering from surgery, he's sitting at 95-98 mph out of the 'pen and at times touching 100 mph. He's learned to be aggressive with his heater, throwing it with late life that enables him to consistently beat hitters up in the zone His changeup features a 12-13 mph demarcation in velocity off of his fastball and has emerged as his best secondary weapon post-surgery, while his mid- to upper-80s slider gives him a third Major League-caliber offering. His control has improved along with stuff, though he still has gains to make with his command.The physical strength PERSON added during his rehab process has made him a more durable pitcher, and he's had no issues working multiple innings in 2019. The ORGANIZATION view him as potential multi-inning weapon out of the bullpen, and it's a safe bet that they'll add PERSON to their 40-man roster this offseason so as to protect him from the Rule 5 Draft.",0
"A converted outfielder, PERSON was up to 100 during extended and has mostly been sitting in the mid-90s with movement. He'll flash an occasionally nasty slider but it's not consistent right now, nor is his strike-throwing, but of course he hasn't been pitching for all that long. He's a 2020 40-man add and will have to developpretty quickly to merit a 40-man spot next winter, but PERSON has had success developing pitching lately and this guy has big ceiling if things click which, based on his build and athleticism, they might.",0
"As a high school junior in 2015, GPE helped PERSON win the ORGANIZATION, then went on to join the GPE pitching staff. After a freshman season spent largely in the bullpen, he jumped on the national radar as a sophomore All-American starter. He's kept on performing as the ORGANIZATION' Friday night starter, giving him the potential to go in the top five rounds of the Draft.While he's not the prototypical starting pitcher in terms of height, the six-foot right-hander does have a lot of arm speed and strength. And he's worked hard to turn himself into more of a pitcher compared to the thrower he was earlier in his amateur career. He can still go get 96-97 mph at times, but is more comfortable sitting in the 91-94 range with a fastball that has cutting and some sinking action to it. He throws both a slider and a curve, and while the former might be a tick ahead of the latter, some feel he might be better served focusing on the curve to differentiate from his fastball more. He sells a future average changeup well and knows how to pitch backwards when needed.While GPE doesn't have the cleanest arm action, with a little stab in the back, he repeats his delivery well and tends to be in sync, leading to a lot of strikes. That gives him the chance to stick in a rotation long-term, with the ceiling of a No. 4 type starter.",0
"PERSON established himself as the premier college power hitter in this year's Draft by leading the ORGANIZATION with eight homers the previous summer. Though he was hampered by a broken hamate during the spring, he still hit 11 homers in 40 games and became the third first-rounder in GPE College history. Selected 31st overall, he signed for $1.4 million.PERSON's massive 6-foot-4, 255-pound frame carries a lot of strength and provides him with huge raw power to all fields. While he can be overly aggressive at times, he usually does a nice job of keeping his left-handed swing under control. When pitchers decline to challenge him, he has shown a willingness to accept walks. Though he played right field in his last two years with the ORGANIZATION and has a strong arm, PERSON's well-below-average speed limits his defensive value. The ORGANIZATION returned him to first base, his freshman position, when he entered pro ball. He has the hands and enough athleticism to get the job done there.",0
"PERSON was coming off of a solid first full season in the ORGANIZATION system, one that saw him earn a late promotion up a level, when he was packaged with fellow lefty PERSON Tarplely and sent to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON Snider.PERSON is all about control and command of his average stuff. While his fastball only touches the low-90s, he throws it with good sink, leading to groundball outs and helping him keep the ball in the ballpark. He throws both his slider and changeup for strikes, and both have the chance to be PERSON average pitches. He'll throw any of his three pitches at any point in the count, doing a good job of keeping hitters guessing. An outfielder in college as well, PERSON is athletic on the mound, repeating his delivery with ease and fielding his position well. PERSON reminded some in the ORGANIZATION organization of another athletic lefty, PERSON, with the chance to be a pitchability lefty who handles a No. 4 or 5 spot in a big league rotation.",1
"After a junior season in which PERSON was among the best power and run-producing hitters in the ORGANIZATION, he was drafted in the ninth round. He opted to return to GPE for his senior season rather than sign with the ORGANIZATION and once again found him on the conference leaderboard for home runs, slugging percentage and a host of other offensive categories.PERSON can hit the ball a long way from the left side of the plate, with a ton of pull power. He is more strength than bat speed, which concerns some, but he did improve his walk rate a tremendous amount during his senior year. A former third baseman, PERSON moved to first base in 2014 and appears to have found a home there.Not a whole lot has changed from a year ago for PERSON, other than him running out of college eligibility. It's still his bat and power potential that will entice a team to take him as a senior sign.",1
"It's hard to quibble with PERSON' stellar 2018. He hit .278/.359/.456 across two levels, and reached and performed at ORGANIZATION as a 19-year-old. He's been drawing trade interest since the moment he set foot on the GPE complex in 2016 due to his very mature feel to hit, which belies his age. Despite this, there are concerns about PERSON. He already has a catcherly build as a teenager and though he has spent the bulk of his pro innings at shortstop, he's not going to stay there and probably won't end up on the middle infield at all. He may eventually have to try to catch (which would slow his development, or the grind may dilute his offensive production) or move to first base, where he saw some reps in the ORGANIZATION this offseason. The instability on defense is concerning even though everyone loves PERSON' bat. We think he'll be an average everyday player for a while but aren't sure about his longevity.",0
"A convert to the mound in 2008, the ORGANIZATION right-hander has taken well to his new craft. He was acquired from the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION deal following a huge 2011 season, his first as a full-time starter. After being a ORGANIZATION State PERSON, earning a promotion to Double-A and winning a spot on the 40-man roster in 2011, GPE's numbers have dipped the past two seasons. He can throw all of his pitches for strikes, and his feel for pitching can allow his stuff to play up. He can run his fastball up to 93 mph, moving it in and out while varying velocity. His changeup has good fade to it, and his breaking stuff is part slider, part curve. But his best secondary offering is his splitter, which is a real swing-and-miss pitch. He was far too hittable in the past couple years, but he still has the chance to be a No. 3-type starter.",0
"There are GPE prospects who are polished and show now tools, then there are ones who scouts have to dream on, projecting what tremendous raw tools might become. PERSON, a one-time two-sport athlete, fits into the latter category with a high ceiling, but a long way to get there.A former basketball standout who was the ORGANIZATION 6A Defensive Player of the Year as a junior, PERSON gave up the sport to focus on baseball. The result has been a better swing than had been seen previously and a body that's starting to transform because he's had time to spend in the weight room. There is still a crudeness to his offensive game, but there are flashes of the ability to hit for average and with power to come as he continues to add strength to his long, lanky frame. Right now, he has to sell out for that power and has instead focused on improving contact. A 70 runner normally, PERSON dealt with a hamstring issue that slowed him some this spring, but that plus speed should allow him to steal bases and cover a ton of ground in center field, where he has a very strong arm.PERSON will be a project for any team that tries to sign him away from his GPE commitment. But teams that love raw tools may look off into the future and see an PERSON or PERSON type if it all comes together.",0
"PERSON was a two-way player at ORGANIZATION, where he had more consistent success as a first baseman/DH than he did as a starter. But scouts thought PERSON's future was brighter on the mound and that he'd fare better once he focused solely on pitching. Thus far, scouts have been correct on both counts. A sixth-round pick in 2012, PERSON missed the end of his first full pro season with a balky elbow. He came back healthy and threw harder than ever in 2014. After the season, he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION along with PERSON. PERSON throws in the low 90s, and he regularly touches 95 mph with his fastball. He is working on refining his secondary pitches, though his curveball and changeup show glimpses of becoming solid offerings. PERSON throws strikes, but he needs to do a better job of locating his pitches within the strike zone. He has a ceiling of a No. 4 starter, and he could also develop into a useful reliever.",0
"Seeking to become the second GPE Virgin Island-born pitcher to reach the big leagues, following PERSON, PERSON has made a lot of progress toward that goal in the last two years. The ORGANIZATION first tried to sign him as a nondrafted free agent out of PERSON in 2010 but didn't get him until two years later as a 20th-rounder out of GPE. He led the high Class A GPE League in strikeout rate (9.8 per nine innings) in 2014 and had his best season yet while reaching Triple-A in 2015. He continued to pile up strikeouts in his return to the ORGANIZATION in 2016, only to be traded to the A's on Aug. 1 along with PERSON and PERSON in the deal for PERSON and PERSON. PERSON began to take off when his fastball velocity spiked from 88-91 mph to 92-96. He gives hitters fits by mixing four-seamers up in the zone with plus changeups in the lower half. Those are his two main offerings, as he also has a curveball and a cutter/slider but neither grades as average.Though he's just 5-foot-11, PERSON uses a high arm slot and short stride to generate plane on his pitches. There's some effort in his delivery, which doesn't prevent him from throwing strikes but does hamper his command. He could be a mid-rotation starter, though some scouts project him as a reliever because of his size and mechanics.",1
" | Overall:5/6 PERSON started and relieved at ORGANIZATION, but really excelled as the ORGANIZATION Devilsâ closer in 2012, and the D-backs drafted him and sent him to full-season LOCATION as a reliever. He has the power arsenal needed to move quickly to the big leagues in the back end of a bullpen, with a plus fastball that hits the upper-90s and a hard slider. He also has a good offspeed pitch, a splitter, but the first two pitches might be enough for the big right-hander. PERSON's size and aggressive mentality are perfectly suited for closing games, something he did during his pro debut and something the D-backs hope to see him doing in GPE in the near future.",0
"When PERSON debuted with PERSON last April, he became the first member of his baseball family to play in the big leagues. His grandfather PERSON managed the ORGANIZATION and GPE for parts of his six season and his father PERSON was a ORGANIZATION first-round pick in the secondary phase of the 1978 January Draft.Kolten Wong's double-play partner at ORGANIZATION and in the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION system, PERSON is a steady defender. He has smooth actions and reliable hands, allowing him to play anywhere in the infield. His average arm is stretched a bit on the left side of the diamond, making second base his best position.PERSON hits for a decent average with a little bit of pop and a few walks thrown in. He has some bat speed but lacks a high offensive ceiling, making him better suited as a utilityman than a potential regular. His makeup and versatility could make him useful in a bench role.",0
"PERSON has an unusually deep repertoire for a pitcher who scouts overwhelmingly project into the bullpen. He has a two seamer, a four seamer that has natural cut to it when he locates to his glove side, a slider (his best pitch dating back to college), and a changeup which has been the focal point of development since PERSON entered pro ball. A casualty of GPE's ability to recruit and develop pitching, PERSON was a college reliever who would've been starting on just about every other college team in the country, so there's a reason he lacks some of the finer attributes scout want to see from a starter. He could be an inefficient No. 4/5, but he might be really good in a multi-inning relief role where he throws 80 or more innings.",0
" GPE will make his GPE debut in 2013 after striking out 9.6 per nine in the ORGANIZATION. The athletic and wiry right-hander has electric stuff and can crank it up to 99 mph, maintaining that kind of velocity deep into starts. His slider has the chance to be a wipeout pitch. He handled his first visit to the GPE, at instructs, well, so the ORGANIZATION are hopeful he'll adjust easily. The key for him will be throwing strikes as well as developing a changeup. He'll begin as a starter, but there's a chance that he ends up in the back end of a bullpen someday.",1
"GPE PERSON gave PERSON just four innings of work as a freshman in 2016 but he impressed scouts with electric stuff in the ORGANIZATION that summer. He transferred to the ORGANIZATION JC of GPE, Manatee-Sarasota in order to become eligible for the 2017 Draft as a sophomore, and the ORGANIZATION signed him for $2.2 million as the 27th overall choice. Like PERSON, GPE's other 2017 first-rounder, he saw his stuff decline in his first full pro season.At his best, PERSON has two plus offerings in a low-80s hammer of a curveball and a 91-96 mph fastball with life and downhill plane. He rarely overwhelmed hitters in 2018, often sitting around 90 mph with his heater and having a good-not-great curve, though his stuff has bounced back somewhat this season. He's slowly making progress with his changeup, which the ORGANIZATION have emphasized after he had little need for one as an amateur, and he also has added a slider.Because PERSON had just 89 innings of college experience, GPE knew he would require time to develop. For now, he's focusing on repeating his delivery and keeping it in sync so he can maintain his best stuff. He throws with effort and has little history of throwing strikes, so he may have average control at best.",0
"Late-rising ORGANIZATION prep center fielder has plus speed and athleticism to project the hitting ability to progress. High-effort player, somewhat stiff, bat is quick, swing compact. Some tweener bench ORGANIZATION traits.",0
"GPE of ORGANIZATION's return from GPE for PERSON, PERSON is a hyper-efficient strike thrower whose curveball moves like a GPE ball, seemingly floating as it approaches the plate before it begins to bend and dive away from right-handed hitters. Because it's a slower, loopy pitch, it may not miss bats against upper-level hitters, but it's hard to square up because of how much depth it has, and PERSON locates it where he wants. So, too, can he spot his low-90s fastball where his catcher asks for it, working up at the letters and to both corners of the plate at will. His ceiling will likely be limited by stuff quality -- though only 20, PERSON is physically mature and unlikely to grow into much more velocity -- but the command makes him a high-probability starter and one who could move quickly.",0
"PERSON's left-handed hitting ability attracted scouts when he was a GPE high school senior in 2012 and a GPE junior in 2015, but worries about his signability knocked him down in the Draft both times. He turned down the D-backs as a 28th-rounder to attend college, then went in the 13th round in June and landed a $500,000 bonus. After getting a late start in 2016, PERSON made up for the lost time with a strong showing in the LOCATION, resulting in a quick promotion to Class A Advanced Potomac. He was hitting .341 there when the ORGANIZATION traded him to the A's for PERSON in August.PERSON is a pure hitter, one with bat speed, fine hand-eye coordination and a feel for managing the strike zone. Though he's just 5-foot-8, he has some surprising power to his pull side. A stress fracture in his back as a sophomore and injuries to his left Achilles tendon and right wrist kept his numbers down with the ORGANIZATION, but he could develop into a 12-15 home run threat as a pro.Defensively, PERSON is adequate but sometimes erratic at second base, and his average speed and substandard arm make left field his only fallback position. Though he has average speed, PERSON is an instinctual baserunner who reads pitchers well and picks his spots to steal.",0
"PERSON is a big strong kid that's been up to 96, has three average or better pitches and lots of extension. Some scouts see more often fringy off-speed pitches and a late-loading arm that needs to be fixed and though he should've gone to GPE while others see some premium abilities to work with that could turn into a league average or better starter.",0
"After leading the ORGANIZATION with eight homers the summer before, PERSON established himself as the best college power hitter in the 2015 Draft. He has lived up to his reputation since signing for $1.5 million as the 31st overall choice, topping the short-season LOCATION with 12 homers in his pro debut and the entire organization (ORGANIZATION and Minors) with 24 blasts in 2017 and 25 last season. His first big league homer traveled 468 feet off PERSON in September. PERSON has plenty of strength and leverage in his massive 6-foot-3 frame, giving him huge natural power to all fields. He could hit home runs without trying but sells out too much for power, letting his left-handed swing get too long and chasing pitches out of the strike zone. His whiff rate has jumped from 20 percent in Double-A to 32 percent in Triple-A to 37 percent in his first taste of the ORGANIZATION, and he's unlikely to hit for much of an average unless he forces pitchers to challenge him more.Mostly a right fielder at ORGANIZATION, PERSON broke into pro ball as a first baseman and made himself into an average defender. With PERSON ensconced there in GPE, the ORGANIZATION shifted PERSON to left field in early 2017. His lack of speed limits his range but he does own solid arm strength.",0
"PERSON PERSON spent parts of six seasons pitching out of the ORGANIZATION' bullpen. His nephew, PERSON, was on the brink of being able to do even more than that with PERSON when a 50-game suspension for performance-enhancers at the start of the 2014 season put a cloud over his future. PERSON did bounce back from that to make it back up to the big leagues in late May.PERSON has all the weapons to start, beginning with a fastball that can touch 95-96 mph. He throws a hard cutter-like slider that is an out pitch at times, and his changeup shows flashes of being above average as well. PERSON struggles with the consistency of his secondary stuff, but he has the ceiling of having three above-average Major League offerings if it can all come together. Staying healthy -- PERSON has missed considerable time in each of the past two seasons -- would help him get the mound development time he needs.Â Now past his suspension, if PERSON can stay healthy, he might be able to continue as a starter. If not, he could follow his uncle's path to the bullpen.",0
"Acquired by PERSON from the ORGANIZATION at the ORGANIZATION in July 2015, PERSON excelled at the Double- and Triple-A levels in '16 to earn a big league callup in August at age 22. However, shoulder fatigue combined with a team-imposed inning cap limited the right-hander to just five starts with the ORGANIZATION, who then traded him along with PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in late November.PERSON possesses an average fastball, thrown in the 91-92 mph range, but he sinks it for ground-ball outs and a deceptive delivery makes it tougher for hitters to pick up. He has one easily above-average pitch in his curveball, a plus breaking ball that misses bats. He also mixes in a slider, which sometimes blends in with his curve a bit too much, and he has a usable changeup, though it's his fourth pitch. He's around the strike zone with all of his pitches.With an advanced feel for four pitches as well as a bulldog mentality on the mound, PERSON shows the makings of becoming a No. 4-type starter at maturity. After getting a taste of the big leagues, he could fill such a role for the ORGANIZATION as soon as 2017.",1
"After swinging a relatively inconsistent bat for much of his career at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, PERSON got hot late, lifting himself to the second round of the 2016 Draft. The adjustments he had made to show that improvement continued into the ORGANIZATION World Series and his pro debut, where he hit for average and power in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League. A broken hand forced him out for six weeks of his full-season debut, but he was swinging the bat well again early in the second half of 2017.PERSON had shortened his swing and used the whole field more effectively during his junior season, and he carried that over last summer. There had been questions about his hit tool, but he didn't show that in GPE, striking out well below the leave average rate and making good adjustments. If he can continue sticking to his solid game plan, that will allow him to tap into his tremendous raw power -- some evaluators put a 70 on it -- with more consistency. While he's a well below-average runner, PERSON is a solid defender at first.The industry often doesn't like the right-right first base only profile, and PERSON will have to continue to prove he can hit to move past that stigma. If the start to his career is any indication, he has the chance to do just that and be a run-producing presence in the middle of a big league lineup.",0
"PERSON PERSON is best known as a wide receiver who played six seasons in the ORGANIZATION, but he also was the last PERSON position player selected in the first five rounds (third round to the Brewers in 1992). Thanks to an all-star summer in the ORGANIZATION last year and a strong finish to his junior season, PERSON could end that drought. He also led the ORGANIZATION in hitting (.387) at the ORGANIZATION in GPE and has set career bests nearly across the board this spring. PERSON's most attractive tool is his power potential, the product of strength, solid bat speed and loft in his left-handed swing. There are times when he focuses on using the opposite field, and others when he gets pull-happy and vulnerable on the other half. He makes consistent contact and draws his share of walks.While PERSON is slow out of the box, he moves well for a 6-foot-3, 210-pounder and has at least average speed once he gets going. He plays right field for PERSON and possesses an average arm, though most scouts project him as a left fielder in pro ball. He needs to improve his reads and routes as a defender, and he has the work ethic to get the job done.",0
"A big Cape PERSON performance lead to a huge junior year at ORGANIZATION, allowing the GPE native to go to his hometown Rockies at ORGANIZATION. 8 overall.Batters react to GPE's fastball as if he's throwing harder than 90-93 mph, because he has some deception in his delivery and the pitch has heavy life, and he can reach 95-96. He throws a true slider in the low 80s and can turn it into more of a mid-80s cutter at times. He'll also display an average changeup at times, getting good sink on it. GPE throws from a lower arm angle and features more effort in his delivery than scouts like to see in a starter. But he should be able to work out of a rotation in pro ball because he has two swing-and-miss pitches and throws strikes.",1
"The ORGANIZATION used both of their first-round picks on up-the-middle preps in 2013, selecting PERSON with the ninth-overall pick and then nabbing ORGANIZATION at ORGANIZATION. 14, targeting the GPE state product for his revered defensive prowess. He reached Double-A for the first time in 2016, the same year that he was dealt with PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION at the ORGANIZATION. Sidelined with a left oblique injury for much of the first half in 2017, ORGANIZATION performed well back in Double-A after making a healthy return in July and then made up for lost time in the ORGANIZATION Winter League during the offseason.ORGANIZATION's defense has long been his calling card, and there's little doubt that it will get him to the big leagues. An excellent blocker and receiver who garners high praise for his game-calling and his ability to handle a staff, ORGANIZATION also is adept at controlling the running game with his plus arm and efficient pop technique. At the plate, ORGANIZATION continues to show natural hitting ability with a level, line-drive producing swing and advanced feel for the zone, and he even showed an uptick in power in 2017, connecting on a career-high six home runs with Double-A New Hampshire despite playing in just 34 games. ORGANIZATION's stock as a hitter seemingly is on the rise now that he's healthy. His glove, meanwhile, is good enough for him to carve out a role as defensive-minded backup, if not a regular in the big leagues.",1
"The best prospect to come out of ORGANIZATION since PERSON was the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in 1981, PERSON went 23rd overall last June and signed for $2,215,000. He has the stuff and command to develop rapidly, and he reached Double-A within a year of signing.PERSON can give hitters fits with two different pitches. He commands his fastball to both sides of the plate with cut and sink, usually operating around 90-94 mph. His mid-80s slider was one of the best available in the 2013 Draft.PERSON is working on refining his changeup and he'll throw an occasional curveball just to give batters a different look. He repeats his sound delivery well, enabling him to fill the strike zone with ease. Add it all up, and he has the look of a possible ORGANIZATION. 2 starter.",1
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION at the relatively advanced age of 21 in March 2015, PERSON quickly has established himself as one of the top left-handers in the ORGANIZATION system. He broke into pro ball as a reliever in the GPE-level ORGANIZATION in 2015, then spent most of last year as a starter while earning three promotions that carried him from GPE ball to Class A Advanced.PERSON's sinker and curveball both rank among the best among GPE farmhands. His two-seam fastball arrives at 91-96 with heavy life, helping him post a 3.6 groundout/flyout ratio in 2016. His curve has been so effective against lower-level hitters that he didn't surrender an extra-base hit to a lefty in his first two years as a pro.PERSON also shows promise with a changeup and provides a reasonable amount of strikes, so he'd seem to have the necessary ingredients to remain a starter. But he's small and stocky and features a high degree of effort, so the ORGANIZATION may return him to the bullpen. If that happens, his stuff should play even better in shorter stints and he could advance rapidly.",0
"He's tall, projectable and left-handed. No wonder PERSON's name was creating some buzz as the GPE approached.It doesn't hurt that he sits in the low 90s, with ease, and has touched the mid-90s at times this spring with a fastball that often has good tail and sink to it. His curve has the chance to be an above-average breaking pitch. He doesn't throw his changeup much, and he'll have to develop it to have prolonged success at the next level. With good mound presence, decent overall control and some pitching know-how, there's reason to believe PERSON will be able to develop that third pitch and refine his command to be a future starter at the highest level.",0
"Scouts were expected to flock to ORGANIZATION this spring to see PERSON until a strained oblique suffered during a bullpen session prior to Opening Day wiped out his entire junior season. The ORGANIZATION still took a flyer on him in the 26th round in June, but the two sides were unable to strike a deal prior to the July 7 signing deadline -- or so it seemed. It later was revealed that PERSON actually had submitted its deal with PERSON (for $605,000) nearly five minutes after the deadline had passed, and a corresponding investigation by PERSON determined he shouldn't be held responsible for the ORGANIZATION' mistake.A 6-foot-4, 235-pound left-hander, PERSON can run his fastball up to 95 mph when healthy, albeit with little feel for where it's going. He features a pair of promising secondary offerings in a curveball and changeup, both of which currently grade as fringe-average but stand to improve with experience.PERSON's feel for pitching leaves quite a bit to be desired, as both his control and command grade out as below average. That being said, he does have the raw components needed to start games at the next level, as well as the pure arm strength to become a late-inning reliever should that not work out.",0
"Outfielder PERSON is the highest-rated player in the state of GPE, and for good reason. But in many ways ORGANIZATION, a product of PERSON in GPE, has outperformed his fellow Keystone State prepster this spring.ORGANIZATION definitely had some helium as the spring finally warmed up and the ORGANIZATION approached, putting up a season that put him in contention for the state's PERSON of the Year award. He has legitimate right-handed power coming from a strong, athetic body. He's more strength over bat speed with a bit of an uphill swing, something he'll likely need to shorten to ensure he taps into that raw pop consistently at the next level. A below-average runner, there are some questions about his ability to stay at the hot corner because of his hands and lack of range. He is fairly physically mature.There were several teams looking at ORGANIZATION in the top five rounds. Those are the teams that believe his bat will translate and he'll hit enough to make his power a plus tool and make it worthwhile to lure him away from his ORGANIZATION of GPE commitment.",0
"PERSON was one of the top performers in the ORGANIZATION in 2013 and was well on his way to becoming a top-five pick the next spring before undergoing PERSON surgery in May 2014. The injury didn't cause him to fall far on GPE day, however, as the ORGANIZATION selected him ninth overall. During a strong pro debut and comeback from surgery, PERSON was shipped to GPE in the ORGANIZATION blockbuster.When healthy, PERSON stands out for his stuff, size and athleticism. His fastball sits in the mid 90s and regularly reaches 98 mph. His big curveball is nearly as good as his fastball, and his changeup gives him a third above-average offering. He fills up the strike zone already and his athleticism gives scouts hope he'll be able to continue to refine his command as a professional. If PERSON is able to return to the form he showed in college, he'll now give the Rockies another impact arm.",1
"The ORGANIZATION have a very deep pitching staff, making it tough for even quality arms to get regular innings. PERSON has been the case for Dunning, who has the stuff to start, but because he has more value for the team as a reliever, hasn't been a regular part of the rotation in 2016.Dunning has gotten some starts on GPE, but because of him being needed to relieve on weekends, it's been sporadic. But many scouts feel he has the stuff to be in a rotation at the next level. He has a plus fastball, up to 95 mph, sitting 92-93 mph and with outstanding movement. He has a very good feel for his changeup as well. His breaking ball is fringy, but shows glimpses of being an average offering. Dunning's arm is so quick that he sometimes struggles with keeping the ball down in the zone, an issue most feel is correctable.Dunning reminds some of another talented Gators arm who had trouble finding rotation innings in college: PERSON. Dunning has the chance to be similar, a relatively quick to the big leagues back-end starting pitcher.",0
"PERSON has uncommon on-field self-awareness for a two-sport high school athlete who was only 20 last year. He has excellent plate discipline and an all-fields, gap-to-gap approach that suits his plus-plus speed; everything he slices down the line or sprays into the gap goes for extra-bases. PERSON also put on a shocking display during BP at the ORGANIZATION and hit two absolute seeds during the game. He never did anything remotely like that in the ORGANIZATION (nor, frankly, did any of the other prospects who played in GPE and then later in GPE) and actually struggled to turn on balls there, but there's a chance of huge, if dormant, in-game power here, too. PERSON runs well enough to play center field (by a lot), his arm strength still might limit him to left field. That's where we have him projected, where we think he'll be a ORGANIZATION or PERSON type of defender. He projects as an excellent leadoff hitter with some pop, but there's a chance he ends up hitting for more power at some point.",0
" The 2012 Draft class wasn't a great one in terms of catching depth, especially from the college ranks, so ORGANIZATION was able to ride a strong junior season at ORGANIZATION into the supplemental first round. At ORGANIZATION, he was a contact-first, offensive-minded catcher, but he has some obvious strength and should hit for more power in the future (he did hit seven homers, including four at home in GPE -- a tough park for hitters). He may not wow anyone with his skills behind the plate, but he's a solid receiver who works well with pitchers and with an arm that was strong and accurate enough to throw out 32 percent of would-be basestealers during his pro debut. There isn't much catching depth in the ORGANIZATION' system and ORGANIZATION rises right to the top of that class.",1
"Though he posted the lowest strikeout rate of his career in 2018 amid a minor swing change, PERSON still did not perform in a semi-repeat of Hi-A. His stance has closed off but there's still a lot of noise in his hands and he only does damage on balls down and in; there's a lot of work to be done if PERSON is going to hit enough to play everyday, despite his physical talent. He still has bench outfielder tools. There's some pull-side power here, a plus arm, and the speed to play center when PERSON is healthy, which he really wasn't last year. He was left back in extended spring training until late May with hamstring soreness and saw more time in left field than in center for the first time in his career. Never an efficient base stealer, PERSON was successful in just two of his seven attempts and didn't even try to swipe a bag after June. He was running better in the ORGANIZATION Winter League and we still like his chances of bouncing back and finding his way onto a big league bench, though there are now several other left-handed hitting outfielders ahead of him in this system.",0
"GPE and raised to the brink of adolescence in GPE, PERSON's family moved to the ORGANIZATION when he was 13. Injuries sustained in a car accident necessitated that metal rods be inserted in PERSON's father's limbs, and the move was a way of providing him physical comfort in a warmer climate. It also meant PERSON became an international prospect rather than an GPE high school draftee, and when he was eligible, he signed with GPE for $1.3 million. 
He is polished for his age, not only in the batter's box but in center field, where he's very comfortable going back on balls. His frame is not especially projectable but PERSON's swing has natural lift and he has good feel for contact. He's likely to get to whatever raw power he ends up growing into as he matures, and he may stay in center field for a while. A broken hamate limited his reps last year, but he may be ready for the GPE-Penn League this season anyway.",0
"In an age when radar gun readings often rule the day, GPE stood out on the summer showcase circuit more with his feel for pitching than plus velocity. He threw 12 shutout innings for the 18U GPE National Team, and there was a reason he got the ball for their gold medal game against GPE, won by GPE thanks to his six scoreless frames.There are better fastballs among the deep high school pitching crop in this GPE class, but GPE's pitchability is what separates him. That's not to say he doesn't have good stuff, because he has the potential to eventually develop three pitches that could garner a 60 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale. He'll throw his fastball in the 89-94 mph range, maintaining the velocity throughout his starts, and he opened some eyes by touching 96-97 mph frequently in the early stages of the spring. He's also made mechanical changes to vastly improve his command of the pitch. He throws a slower curveball with three-quarters tilt and good spin rate and introduced a new, and very effective, slider this spring. And his changeup gives him a third secondary pitch that could be plus when all is said and done.The top left-hander in the GPE class, GPE has thrown well enough this spring to cement himself as a potential top 10 pick in June.",0
"A pair of high school pitchers in the ORGANIZATION attracted scouts down the stretch after missing the first part of the season with injuries. PERSON's PERSON (meniscus) has a better fastball, while PERSON (torn fingernail) has more polish and a better chance to make it as a long-term starter. PERSON was inconsistent after his layoff but at his best looked worthy of the third or fourth round.When he was on, PERSON pounded the bottom of the strike zone with a 90-95 mph fastball and got swings and misses with a 78-82 mph spike curveball. At other times, he topped out around 92 mph and showed a more ordinary curveball. He doesn't employ a changeup often but his feel for pitching bodes well for his ability to refine it.PERSON's delivery also varied. He looked smooth and fairly effortless on his best days but also had outings where he threw across his body and had a head whack. He showed enough upside that he'll probably get drafted high enough to lure him away from his commitment to GPE.",0
"A staple on the travel ball circuit for several years, PERSON has a long track record of performance against high-level pitching and his elite speed makes it likely that he plays a premium defensive position in pro ball, and plays it well. He faces questions about his size, and power doesn't project to be a real part of what he ends up doing. Instead, PERSON is a high-effort offensive catalyst who knifes at defenses with line drives and well-placed bunts. He is twitchy, strong, has great feel for the strike zone, he's short to the ball and tough to strike out, and has feel for all-fields contact. He has a traditional leadoff hitter's skillset from a tools/stylistic standpoint, but a modern leadoff man's approach and on base ability. Capable of playing a passable shortstop, PERSON is most likely to end up as an above-average defender at second, and his elite speed could make him a valuable defender in center field if needed.",0
"Scouting grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 40 | Run: 60 | Arm: 60 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45A two-way player and multi-sport athlete, PERSON has had an uneven spring that has made it a bit more difficult to figure out his ORGANIZATION stock. More scouts seem to like him on the mound, while he might prefer to hit.At his best early in the spring, PERSON was touching 95 mph and sitting 93 mph with a loose arm and the potential to add more as he matured. He'll show a circle change which, like his fastball, has tailing life to it and good deception. His slider will also flash as a solid pitch, thrown with good three-quarters break, but his arm and delivery had gone backwards. PERSON was PERSON wanted to go out as a center fielder, where his football background as a receiver helps him take good routes and angles and his plus arm works well. He's not a burner and there was some concern about a lack of a feel to hit.A team that believes what they saw early in the year is the true PERSON on the mound may roll the dice, if they feel they can convince him to pitch and forego his commitment to GPE.",0
"GPE shortstops who can stay at the position in pro ball are rare, but the 2015 Draft may have one in PERSON. And while he struggled with the bat in his first two seasons at GSP and in his first summer in the ORGANIZATION, he gave cause for optimism by finishing second in the Cape in batting (.364) in 2014. PERSON got stronger and shortened his right-handed swing, and as he became more confident and aggressive, he began driving more balls to the gaps, though he hasn't hit as well during his junior season back at GSP. He controls the strike zone reasonably well and has plus speed, making him a potential fit for the top of the order. PERSON has the range and arm strength to make most of the plays at shortstop, though he can get error-prone when he tries to do too much. PERSON, his ORGANIZATION manager, said PERSON covers more ground than PERSON defensive stalwart PERSON, whom PERSON also skippered on the Cape.",0
"There have been some interesting pitching prospects in recent Drafts who came late to full-time pitching, including first-rounders PERSON in 2013 and PERSON in 2012. While GPE isn't quite that high-profile, he has the chance to do well now that he's focused only on the mound.An outfielder for his first two years at ORGANIZATION, GPE split time between playing that position and pitching as a sophomore then turned to pitching full-time in 2014. He's athletic, if a bit undersized, with the makings of two plus pitches in his fastball and spike curveball, which looks like a hard slider at times. He's working on developing his changeup.The jury is still out on whether GPE can start long-term -- sometimes a bias against undersized right-handers -- or he'll end up in the bullpen. Either way, his arm looks like it has a shot to pitch at the highest level.",0
"Since signing for a $1.3 million bonus -- a record for a GPE player -- in January 2010, PERSON advanced rapidly to Double-A. He has the best combination of raw power and pure arm strength among PERSON catchers, though he's still polishing those tools and the other aspects of his game. Unfortunately for him, his 2015 season was put on hold when he underwent surgery on his left ankle in June. That didn't keep the Phillies from wanting him, making sure he was included in the package they received in return for PERSON has the strength and bat speed to drive balls out of any part of any ballpark without selling out for power, yet he's still overly aggressive at the plate. He swings and misses frequently, and he needs to do a better job of taking pitches and recognizing breaking balls. If he figures it out, he could be an average hitter with 20-plus homers per season in the big leagues. Similarly, he has a cannon arm and good athleticism for a catcher but needs a lot of refinement behind the plate. He threw out just 28 percent of basestealers and committed 23 passed balls in 90 games in 2014. Though he has played first base and tried the outfield in instructional league play, it's too soon to give up on the idea that he can become an All-Star catcher.",1
"A tiny speedster, PERSON's build is relatively unprojectable, but one can still project on most of his skills because he was only taught baseball's basics while growing up in GPE, and hasn't been switch-hitting for very long. His game has some coherent small-ball elements already, as he took  quickly to bunting and putting awkward contact into play, which, because of his speed, enables him to reach against bad low-level defenses. 
There's so little power here that PERSON likely projects as a fourth outfielder, but his feel for contact is impressive for someone of his background and seemingly insufficient physicality, and if he ends up with a 6 or 7 bat, we might be talking about a regular.",0
"A third-round Draft pick in 2014 from the ORGANIZATION prep ranks, PERSON won the Rookie-level PERSON's PERSON in his pro debut and then paced the ORGANIZATION in home runs (27) and ORGANIZATION (92) the next year. He built on that performance in 2016 at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Lynchburg, where, at age 20, he established career bests in home runs (29) and ORGANIZATION (102) en route to the ORGANIZATION MVP award. It was more of the same for PERSON in his first Double-A campaign, as he connected on 23 more home runs while also improving his approach and making more contact, and he eclipsed the 20-homer for the fourth straight year in 2018. PERSON's plus power has translated at every stop in his career. He can apply it to all fields during games thanks to a combination of strength, bat speed and natural hitting ability, though he was too pull-happy at times in 2017. After striking out 29.7 percent of the time in 2016, PERSON trimmed his whiff rate down to 22.9 percent in Double-A, all while maintaining the same healthy walk rate he's shown throughout his career. There is some concern regarding his hit-tool potential, but PERSON has made enough strides with his approach and pitch recognition to believe it could be at least below average. He's a well-below-average runner and below average at first base, though he did make gains defensively with extra reps in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's bat, and specifically his power, will be what gets him to the ORGANIZATION. With a few more adjustments along the way, he could soon find himself driving in runs for the GPE.",1
"The high-energy and athletic PERSON can run with the best of them.This speedy middle infielder is a plus runner with sound defensive actions. He makes all of the routine plays on defense and has decent arm strength now. PERSON also like his soft hands and solid footwork.The lean PERSON can also hit. He has been praised for his mature approach at the plate and for his good bat speed through the strike zone. While PERSON might lack home run power now, he does have the ability to hit the ball to all fields. He's also projected to hit for average and is expected to improve his overall offensive game once he signs with a club and enters a team's academy.Some think PERSON's offensive skill set might be best suited for the top of the batting order.From PERSON, GPE, PERSON trains with PERSON. He has been linked to the ORGANIZATION.",0
" GPE was the ORGANIZATION' top prize in the 2012 international signing class. They've given him challenging assignments, and he was among the youngest everyday players in his league in each of his first two professional seasons. GPE has a short, compact body that is well suited to a career behind the plate. He has a quick release and strong arm, and he will shut down the running game as he gains more experience. He's making strides with the finer points of catching, including game calling. While defense is the strongest part of GPE's game, he has the tools to develop offensively, as well. The potential to be a top-notch all-around catcher is there, but he will be just 19 for all of the 2015 season and remains a long way from a finished product.",0
"Likely in need of a swing change to profile at first, ORGANIZATION' cut too often slices down at the baseball, and he can only get to his considerable raw power in certain parts of the strike zone. He has good bat control and makes mid-flight adjustments to breaking balls, which he has the raw strength to punish even if the timing of his lower half has been compromised. He's a good hitter, just one we're skeptical will clear the offensive bar at first base without trading some contact for power. ORGANIZATION is also another example of why we should be skeptical of hitters' power numbers at FACILITY.",0
"PERSON primarily played second and third base at ORGANIZATION and did the same in his pro debut after signing for $110,000 as a 12th-rounder in 2015. But he also had caught a bit for the ORGANIZATION, and the ORGANIZATION drafted him with the idea of shifting him behind the plate, a conversion he made full-time in 2016. While PERSON lacks the quickness pro teams desire in an infielder, he's athletic and agile for a catcher. His pure arm strength is average but it plays better than that because he has a quick release and makes accurate throws. His receiving is still a work in progress but he has soft hands.PERSON is more about getting on base than driving the ball as a hitter. His patient approach and inside-out, right-handed swing lend themselves to making contact, though he does have some gap power. He has below-average speed but good instincts on the bases.",0
"It's uncommon for a college hitter to have more walks than strikeouts during his career but PERSON' ratio during his junior season at PERSON was exceptional. He walked 52 times and struck out just 16 while also swiping an ultra-efficient 25 bases in 26 attempts. He's a nearly plus-plus runner and capable middle infield defender (probably at second) with premium hand-eye coordination and bat control. There was some concern that PERSON beat up on small conference pitching his entire career, and that he may not replicate that performance against pro pitching, but we're buying it. Once poised to perhaps move quickly through the system, PERSON had posterior labrum surgery in late-March and will miss much of the season.",0
"When PERSON first got to the ORGANIZATION of GPE, he was the ORGANIZATION' regular catcher. After struggling with the bat and losing playing time, he moved to the mound and pitched well enough to land in the fourth round of the 2015 Draft. A reliever only, the right-hander started to put things together a bit more in '17, reaching Double-A for the first time and capping things off with a turn in the ORGANIZATION League.PERSON has always stood out with his arm strength, using a shorter catcher-like arm action to fire plus fastballs. He'll be up to 98 mph consistently out of the 'pen. In the ORGANIZATION, PERSON still had enough in the tank to be touching 97 mph. His ability to make a step forward and pitch well in GPE is directly related to improvement with his slider, which now flashes solid average to above average at times.PERSON will have to continue to work on his command, though it doesn't have to be pinpoint to have success at the highest level. He might not have closer potential, but the ORGANIZATION think he isn't far from impacting their bullpen in GPE.",0

PERSON has also been a solid two-way player for ORGANIZATION as he played on the 2014 14U ORGANIZATION roster and the 2016 17U ORGANIZATION roster. With the 2014 ORGANIZATION, PERSON hit .444, scored three runs and drove in three more for a team that finished 3-1 overall. In 2016, PERSON switched to the pitching side of things, as he recorded 3.1 innings for PERSON. A tall, lean projectable pitcher, PERSON has a fastball that presently sits at 88-91 mph and it looks like there is room for him to continue to gain strength. The right-hander has clean arm action and a balanced downhill delivery, and has already committed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE. PERSON's curveball is near average and has the ability to finish off hitters. He is also steadily improving his mound presence and pitchability.",0
"As a sophomore at the ORGANIZATION of PERSON, PERSON began as a reliever, but gained confidence when given the chance to move into the rotation. He's been a weekend starter all year and while he's had some up-and-down results, he's far outperformed fellow Draft prospect PERSON has missed a ton of bats this spring, while walking very few, thanks to a solid four-pitch mix. He'll throw his fastball up to 94 mph consistently, complementing it with a pair of breaking balls. His slider will show flashes of being above-average and he'll fold in a fringy curve as well. His changeup continues to develop and could eventually be average when all is said and done. While he has a high strikeout rate, he's also been fairly hittable.PERSON is more floor than ceiling, though he does have a solid delivery and a good 6-foot-3 pitcher's frame. His upside is as a No. 4 or 5 starter, one who could come off the board in the top six rounds, which would make him the first PERSON pitcher to be taken that early since PERSON was a fourth-round pick of the Rockies in 2015.",0
"As twitchy as catching prospects get, PERSON posts plus-plus pop times thanks to a combination of plus raw arm strength, efficient footwork and a transfer so quick it qualifies as slight of hand. He's also a promising receiver and, while physically projectable, scouts don't anticipate PERSON will get so big that he needs to abandon the position. He also has plus raw power projection and a good chance to get to much of it as a right-handed hitter, though his left-handed stroke is somewhat stiff and upright. PERSON is the best J2 catching prospect since PERSON (PERSON had more power projection and pure arm strength) and, ignoring hindsight, there's an argument that PERSON is superior because of how likely he is is to remain behind the plate (PERSON had mobility and receiving issues) and grow into a well-rounded, impact defender.",1
"Signed for just shy of $1.5 million in July of 2018, PERSON is a physical projection third base prospect. Of all the players from the 2018 July 2 class who will almost certainly end up in a corner, PERSON was our highest ranked. He has an athletic, rotational swing, plus bat speed, his bat path has some natural lift, and he has a frame that appears destined to add considerable mass and strength. PERSON accuracy and mobility issues, especially as he gets bigger, could move PERSON down the defensive spectrum, but he could end up with above or plus hit and power tools.",0
"An offensive lineman in high school, ORGANIZATION lost a ton of weight to get in baseball shape. That helped him reach the fourth round of the 2014 Draft. The down side of that transformation was that he tired during his first full season of pro ball, though there is a good amount of offensive upside to be had here.ORGANIZATION had primarily played third as a pro heading into 2016, though he mixed in some first. That's where he played nearly exclusively during the 2016 season. He's a below-average fielder at both corner infield spots.In the end, though, it will be ORGANIZATION's bat that carries him up the ladder. Finding that happy medium between too slimmed down and offensive lineman should help him reach his offensive ceiling.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 14, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON  Speak to scouts and they'll tell you that PERSON brings the power. The slugger, who hopes to model his game after PERSON, strikes the ball very hard and hits it high and far.At the World Power Showcase World Classic, he proved his strength, blasting numerous home runs more than 500 feet during the exhibition at FACILITY in Miami.PERSON's extra large power frame has drawn similarities to that of the recently retired PERSON. He has room to improve defensively and profiles more as a first baseman, but PERSON's power potential is evident.",0
"PERSON initially signed with the D-backs back in January 2013, and to say it's been a slow development process would be a bit of an understatement. The ORGANIZATION right-hander spent two summers in the ORGANIZATION before making his GPE debut in '15. He made his full-season debut the following year, a summer that included a 17-strikeout performance in GPE, though he repeated the level in '17. Things looked like they were starting to click, however, with a move to the GPE League this season.The 6-foot-3 right-hander has a good pitcher's frame and some solid stuff to go along with it. PERSON features a fastball he throws in the 90-94 mph range that he maintains throughout his start. His slider has improved and now gives him a solid breaking ball that misses bats. He also has a developing changeup that he mixes in effectively. While PERSON has been tougher to hit and his strikeout rate has gone up, so has his walk rate, and he is more control over command with his arsenal at this point.Even with his slow progress, PERSON is still young for his level and there's no reason for the D-backs to lose patience given the step forward he's taken. He has a ceiling as a back-end starter, though he could look awfully good with that fastball-slider combination in a shorter relief role.",0
"  After PERSON surgery all but wiped out his entire 2013 season, PERSON returned to action the next year with PERSON. He earned All-Star honors in the LOCATION, and finished the season with a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION League.Known for his defense coming out of GPE in 2012, PERSON excelled offensively in his first season back from surgery. Employing an up-the-middle approach, he makes a fair amount of contact and has some power. His defensive skills remain strong. He's a good receiver, blocks balls well and has enough arm strength to control the running game. PERSON's defense give him a good chance to reach the big leagues. First, however, he'll need to show he can continue his offensive success as he advances to the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON succeeded PERSON (now at FACILITY) as the quarterback and top baseball prospect at ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, N.C.) this spring. He has the most live arm in ORGANIZATION's prep class, though there's debate as to his long-term role and whether he's signable away from a GPE commitment.PERSON already can touch 95 mph with his fastball and popped 93s and 94s more frequently as the ORGANIZATION approached. His heater has jumped about 5 mph from a year ago and could reside in the mid-90s if he continues to develop physically. He generates a lot of ugly swings with the lateral break on his low-80s slider but has yet to exhibit much feel for a changeup.While throwing across his body gives PERSON some action on his pitches, it also costs him command. Some scouts look at the effort in his delivery and the length of his arm action and project him as a definite reliever. Others think he's athletic and strong enough to power through and make it as a starter.",0
"This spring, PERSON surprised scouts who were not expecting him to be such a polished, zone-pounding pitcher. PERSON is a good athlete who repeats his (non-traditional) delivery and has plus control, but you can't project his stuff to improve much because his frame is maxed out. On the bright side, his stuff is already plenty good, sitting 92-94 with above average life most days, and running up to 98 mph in a heavily-scouted playoff matchup with PERSON that PERSON ended up winning. PERSON also has a nasty, plus changeup that he'll use even against poor prep hitters that can't catch up to his fastball, and his changeup moves so much they still can't hit it. His slider was an above average to plus pitch in the summer and, with a slightly different grip this spring, the pitch has been more average to slightly above. It's still effective against right handed hitters. 

PERSON will need a slight delivery adjustment to fix his direction to the plate but otherwise, along with PERSON, offers something close to a finished product that just needs to make small improvements. Some scouts pick apart PERSON's delivery and arm action but there's some cognitive dissonance there as both are better than PERSON's and PERSON, right now, looks something like what PERSON looked like a year ago. There's plenty of teams showing lots of interest in the 10-20 range and the rumored $3 million price tag will likely be met.",0
"GPE is an above-average runner, defender and thrower, but scouts aren't completely sold on him offensively, projecting him as a gap-to-gap hitter with modest power. PERSON had the trump card to sign him earlier this year and wouldn't top the rumored $2 million price he was offered to wait for July 2nd, 2019.",0
"GPE was the best high school prospect in GPE in 2013 -- and an all-state wide receiver as well -- but his commitment to PERSON dropped him to the ORGANIZATION in the 17th round. After performing well in college and leading the ORGANIZATION with in strikeouts (50 in 39 2/3 innings) last summer, GPE was named the 2016 ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year after a spectacular junior season in which he allowed just three earned runs in his final 12 starts and ultimately led all ORGANIZATION Division I hurlers with a 0.69 ERA, the lowest for a starter at that level since 1979. The ORGANIZATION took him with the 25th overall pick in June, making GPE the first ORGANIZATION starter taken in the first round since PERSON went third overall in 1994.GPE has four effective pitches and mixes them well. His best offerings are a low-90s fastball that reaches 94 mph and features some cutting action and nice downhill plane, and a solid 78-83 mph slider. GPE also possesses a mid-70s curveball and a changeup with some sink and ORGANIZATION's athletic, effortless delivery allows him to repeat his mechanics and throw quality strikes. While he doesn't have a true out pitch or a lofty ceiling, GPE projects as a mid-rotation starter and may have a higher floor than any left-hander in the 2016 Draft.",1
"The LOCATION product jumped on the fast track, reaching Double-A in his first full season and there's a lot to like in terms of his size and stuff. Some see him as a future reliever because of his arm strength and some inconsistencies with his secondary pitches, but he can maintain his fastball velocity â he'll touch 95 mph â deep into his starts. His slider and changeup both have the chance to be PERSON average, so there's enough to work with as a starter for the time being, knowing that the ORGANIZATION could shorten him up and have him help as a short reliever should the need arise.",0
"Think PERSON. At 5-foot-8, 155 pounds, PERSON isn't the biggest middle infielder on the market, but he makes up for his lack of size with a good bat and above-average tools.Scouts like PERSON's switch-hitting abilities and that he has shown equal bat speed and homer power from both sides. He has impressed evaluators with his sound approach at the plate and his ability to drive the ball from gap to gap during ORGANIZATION games.Defensively, PERSON has the hands, footwork and range to stay at shortstop once he signs with a Major League team and enters the club's academy. An above-average arm also helps his chances of staying at shortstop.PERSON is known as an above-average runner with good instincts on the bases. He also loves to play the game. PERSON is based in GPE PERSON, GPE, and is trained by PERSON. The ORGANIZATION have expressed serious interest in the infielder.",0
"PERSON seemingly drew lots of trade interest while with PERSON. PERSON, lean, and wielding premium stuff, his name was rumored to be on some PTBNL lists before he was ultimately traded to GPE as part of the ORGANIZATION deal in 2018. During his first few pro seasons, PERSON's velocity yo-yo'd a bit; he was at times in the upper-90s, while more 91-95 at others. He was also demoted from the LOCATION back to the ORGANIZATION in 2017 for reasons seemingly unrelated to performance. The following spring, not only was PERSON's velocity more stable -- in the 93-96 range -- but he was throwing strikes and had more consistent secondary stuff. 
While he can spin a good breaking ball, PERSON's best secondary pitch is his changeup, which he sells with electric arm speed. He worked with better angle after the ORGANIZATION acquired him last summer, a change that improved the playability of his breaking ball without taking away from his changeup's movement. Now a physically mature, 230-pound 21-year-old, PERSON seems poised to take a bit of a leap and perhaps reach the ORGANIZATION State League later in the year. He may end up with three impact pitches if his secondaries have yet another gear of quality left to claim, which makes him a threat for the top 100 list either later this year or next.",0
"PERSON PERSON reached Triple-A as an outfielder and now scouts GPE for the ORGANIZATION. One of the best 2014 prospects in his area also happens to be his son.Derek PERSON is one of the fastest players and best defensive players in this year's high school class. He ran sub-6.4 60-yard-dashes on the showcase circuit this summer, and he glides around center field. He also has a solid arm, stronger than most at his position.An GPE recruit, PERSON has offensive potential as well. With his wheels, bat speed, line-drive swing and mature approach, he should have no trouble hitting for average. He also displays some gap power, with the potential for perhaps more once he adds strength.",0
"PERSON's first month of the season was such a disaster that scouts thought he was either hurt or extremely bored. He hit well in July and August and earned a September call-up, during which he played great defense all over the infield. PERSON has issues getting to balls away from him and probably won't hit for much power, but he's very patient and could reach base enough to hit at the top of a lineup. He's only an average runner but he's also a very gifted athlete with a plus arm and a quick transfer. PERSON can make strong throws to first from all kinds of difficult platforms and projects as a plus defensive shortstop. Table-setting defensive wizards are pretty rare. He could go .270/.340/.400 with 12-15 homers and the ORGANIZATION trade paves the way for playing time immediately.",1
"Signed in 2012 out of GPE, PERSON struggled during his first three years in the ORGANIZATION' system before breaking out in full-season ball in 2016. The right-hander dominated at ORGANIZATION A Lansing early in the year to earn a promotion to ORGANIZATION A Advanced Dunedin as well as a spot on the ORGANIZATION's roster in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON at FACILITY in July. PERSON held his own over 15 starts in the ORGANIZATION State League, but he also missed fewer bats and wore down physically late in the year.Working from a three-quarters slot, PERSON sits at 90-92 mph and touches 93-94 with his fastball. He has natural deception that makes the pitch's velocity play up, and he did a better job of challenging hitters with it last season while also making strides with his command. PERSON has excellent feel for spinning his above-average curveball, while his slider, thrown in the low 80s with late, short break, should be at least fringe-average. PERSON also employs a changeup, though it's well below average and requires considerable refinement, and exhibits average control of his entire arsenal.PERSON began to attack hitters early in the count last season, and the ORGANIZATION hope he can build on that in future seasons. While underwhelming secondaries limit PERSON' upside to that of a No. 4 starter, there are some who believe he could be an effective late-inning reliever based on the merits of his fastball and slider.",0
" A left-handed-hitting infielder from eastern GPE, PERSON had a very good summer on the showcase circuit, playing well at both the LOCATION Pro Showcase in GPE and the ORGANIZATION held at ORGANIZATION in GPE. That performance didn't carry over at first to this spring, but he came on strong as the spring wore on, landing him in third round.Strong and athletic, PERSON has a solid left-handed swing and a good approach at the plate. There is some raw power to tap into from his frame, though he'll have to make sure he doesn't get too stiff and muscle-bound. A shortstop in high school, he'll better suited to infield corner, where his above-average arm and solid hands should play well. Whether PERSON can profile as an everyday corner infielder remains to be seen, but those who see his plus makeup and work ethic won't want to count him out. He saw time at first, third, left field and even shortstop during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION, before getting a bump up to the GPE.",0
"GPE is a late-count power bat that probably just fits in left field or first base long-term. His 2019 full-season debut opened eyes with his combination of power, exit velo and approach.",0
"Two of the best prep left-handers in the 2018 PERSON matched up March 22, when PERSON and PERSON (Tenn.) High visited PERSON and PERSON (Ala.) High. Weathers is regarded as the better prospect and has a chance to go in the first round, though PERSON outperformed him with 13 strikeouts in five innings in a game PERSON won in the ninth. He should give PERSON a high school southpaw taken in the top four rounds for the fifth time in the last six GPE, following PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON Heatherly.Teams that covet high spin rates will be attracted to PERSON, who generates some of the highest fastball and breaking ball ORGANIZATION in his prep class. His heater generally ranges from 88-92 mph, and his lower-three-quarters slot creates angle and running action. He throws two distinct breaking pitches, with his sharp low-80s slider grading better than his upper-70s curveball.The athleticism that allows PERSON to double as PERSON's center fielder also translates into advanced control, as he displays the aptitude to pitch to both sides of the plate and pound the bottom of the strike zone. His biggest needs are to refine a changeup he hasn't needed much in high school and to get stronger, though there's not a ton of projection left in his 6-foot-2 frame. He has the potential to have four solid pitches and has a higher floor than most high school lefties.",0
"When PERSON has been on the field, he's shown what all the fuss was about and why he was worthy of a top 10 selection in the 2013 Draft. Unfortunately, he missed all but 45 total games of the 2014 season because of a hamstring issue he had difficulty shaking. Once he did, though, he performed the way everyone expected him to.PERSON has a smooth swing from the left side of the plate with an advanced approach, especially for someone of his age and experience level. He's more of a line-drive type right now, using all fields, but the bat speed is there to project more power as he matures. PERSON has excellent speed that helps him cover a lot of ground in center field, though it hasn't translated to stolen base success. He should be able to stick in center long-term, albeit with a slightly below-average arm. He should fit the profile of a left fielder offensively should he have to move.PERSON missed a considerable amount of development time in 2014 and there certainly is no pressing need in the ORGANIZATION outfield. Still, PERSON' offensive ability should allow him to start moving more quickly now that he's healthy.",1
" Unheralded coming out of high school, PERSON has made a name for himself in college. After an impressive freshman year, his sophomore season was all but wiped out by a broken wrist. He got back in time to play in the ORGANIZATION and played well in his return to the LOCATION lineup this spring. While he doesn't face elite pitching in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON has built a strong track record of production everywhere he's gone. His compact swing, feel for the barrel and advanced approach at the plate are the keys to his offensive success. He has some raw power to tap into, but his swing is more geared toward hitting line drives. He is an above-average runner and covers ground well in the outfield, though he has a below-average arm.Due to his injury, PERSON has two years of eligibility remaining. But he'll turn 22 in September, making him one of the older players in his class.",0
"After having five right-handers selected in the top five rounds of the past four GPE, PERSON produced two more viable candidates for the 2017 Draft in relievers PERSON and PERSON. The ORGANIZATION' career saves leader with 27, PERSON was the first of the pair to be selected, going to the ORGANIZATION in the fourth round and then signing for $400,000. After reaching full-season ball in his professional debut, PERSON advanced to Class A Advanced Modesto in '18 and garnered midseason All-Star honors in the GPE League before getting sent to the Cardinals in return for PERSON Tuivailala.PERSON has a strong, durable frame and three pitches. He has a quick arm that consistently produces 93-95 mph fastballs with heavy sink that he can command to either side of the plate. PERSON usually throws his low-80s slider for strikes, and at times it can play like a cutter, with short, glove-slide slice. He shows some feel for a changeup but doesn't need it much in a relief role.PERSON's size and arsenal profile well in a big league bullpen, and he has the potential to get there quickly if he can refine his slider and improve his control.",0
"PERSON had been a reliever during his junior year at ORGANIZATION when the ORGANIZATION took him in the third round of the 2012 Draft, but GPE developed him as a starter. After moving incrementally in that role, a return to the bullpen in 2015 had PERSON really pointing in the right direction when GPE sent him to the D-backs in the ORGANIZATION trade. PERSON gave him one start at the very end of the season.As a starter, PERSON would try to mix in four pitches, with a fastball, slider, curveball and changeup. As a reliever, he leaned largely on his fastball and slider, both of which are PERSON average offerings. He still mixed in a changeup on occasion to keep hitters honest. PERSON has always had solid control, but it ticked up a notch when he was throwing shorter stints. The 25-year-old right-hander doesn't have the stuff to close, with a middle relief role more likely if he sticks in the bullpen. For now, though, the D-backs are planning on giving him another crack at pitching in a rotation.",0
"GPE has been a bullpen mainstay for ORGANIZATION since his freshman year in 2017 and set a school record with 14 saves last year, when the ORGANIZATION finished runner-up at the ORGANIZATION World Series. He'll likely be the first reliever drafted in 2019, perhaps as high as the second round by a team that places a lot of emphasis on analytics.There's nothing subtle about GPE, who attacks hitters with two plus pitches that feature outstanding spin rates. His 92-96 mph fastball gets great carry in the strike zone, appearing to rise as it reaches the plate. His over-the-top arm slot helps him get nice depth on his curveball, which can be a true hammer in the mid 70s.GPE has a lot of effort and some recoil in his delivery, so there's no thought of trying to deploy him as a starter. He battled the strike zone as a freshman before pounding it as a sophomore, but his control has regressed this spring. He projects as a setup man with perhaps a chance to close if he provides more strikes.",0
"PERSON has tantalized scouts since early in his pro career with a strong, athletic frame and flashy tools that are above average to plus across the board. He largely was seen as potential, even passed over by all 30 teams in the Rule 5 Draft after the 2015 season, then he broke out in a huge way in 2017 reaching a critical mass of adjustments and maturity that showed up in the counting stats. PERSON has cut down on his swing and miss while also lifting the ball more and hitting it with more authority, an obviously rare and desirable combination when you're already working with a toolsy prospect that was always young for his level. There's still some lingering maturity questions and mental lapses on defense, but that didn't stop the ORGANIZATION and other clubs from demanding PERSON in recent trade talks with the ORGANIZATION, who refused to discuss PERSON.",1
" The ORGANIZATION had a pair of enigmatic lefties at the upper levels in PERSON and PERSON. PERSON is now a Tampa Bay Ray, leaving PERSON to carry the mantel. The results haven't been there, largely because of command, despite still having decent stuff. He'll throw his 90-91 mph fastball downhill and combine it with a decent fading changeup. He mixes in a fringy big breaking curve. More than anything, he's struggled to throw strikes consistently, leading to big pitch counts and a career 4.6 per nine walk rate. He did make it up to Triple-A in 2012, but this is a big year for him to show, at age 25, that he still has a future as a big league starter.",0
"The youngest player (age 19) on PERSON's 2013 World Baseball Classic team, PERSON established himself as one of the better young hitters in his nation. He had a long track record of performing in international youth and junior tournaments for PERSON, and he batted .283 in three seasons in the island's top league at ages 18-20. PERSON defected in 2014 and signed last July for $1.6 million.PERSON has advanced ability at the plate, repeatedly barreling balls and using the middle of the field. He employs a compact right-handed swing and controls the strike zone well. PERSON can drive the ball, but most of his power will come in the form of doubles rather than home runs.Though PERSON won PERSON's version of a ORGANIZATION as an 18-year-old in 2011, he's more dependable than flashy in the field. His average arm strength and quickness fit best at second base. PERSON's game has drawn comparisons to that of All-Star Howie PERSON's.",0
"At one point in the not-too-distant past, it looked as if the millions the D-backs spent to sign PERSON would go to waste. He had received a bonus north of $8 million, and the team had to pay nearly as much in an overage penalty, but a combination of struggles with performance to go along with off-the-field issues nearly forced the right-hander from the game. It looks, however, like PERSON has put much of that, as well as shoulder and blister issues that kept him off the mound until July, behind him after an absolutely dominant stint in relief in the GPE League in 2017, a strong move up to Double-A and a trip to the ORGANIZATION in 2018.When healthy -- and he has had some shoulder issues in the past -- PERSON has some nasty stuff well-suited for short relief. He throws his fastball regularly in the mid-to-upper 90s with some serious late life. His slider is a true wipeout pitch that greatly contributed to his insane 16.4 K/9 rate in GPE last year. The fastball-slider combination was devastating to hitters particularly because he threw strikes at a better rate than he ever has.PERSON took a huge step forward in terms of maturity and understanding what it takes to be a professional pitcher here. If he can stay on the mound, he should be able to impact the D-backs bullpen soon.",0
"In 2017, PERSON was the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in the GPE as a shortstop out of ORGANIZATION in GPE. PERSON didn't play shortstop until 2017 because he was blocked by PERSON. PERSON has since moved to second base at ORGANIZATION and, coming off a huge sophomore season that saw him lead the GPE in a host of offensive categories, started slowly in his junior season but was starting to show the advanced bat that scouts saw the year prior as the GPE approached.It's PERSON's hit tool that stands out. He can flat out rake with excellent strike zone discipline, showing the ability to barrel up the baseball consistently. While he doesn't have huge raw power, there's some definite thump from the right side of the plate and he can punish mistakes. While he was a shortstop in high school, he doesn't have the arm or speed to play there, but he should be a reliable defender at second base.It's the bat, though, that will get him drafted in the early rounds of the 2019 GPE. He profiles as an offensive-minded second baseman with some power, kind of like a right-handed version of GPE product PERSON, who made his big league debut with the Pirates in 2018.",0
"After logging 39 innings as a true freshman in 2016, PERSON garnered Mid-American Conference pitcher of the year honors as both as sophomore and junior, going a combined 15-3 in 30 starts with 251 strikeouts in 170 2/3 innings between the two years. The ORGANIZATION selected PERSON in the eighth round of the 2018 Draft, signed him for $169,600 and watched him continue to dominate in his pro debut. PERSON's first full season brought similar results, as he made just six starts at ORGANIZATION A Lansing before moving up to ORGANIZATION A Advanced Dunedin.PERSON's effectiveness is routed in his invisible fastball. He throws his heater with below-average velocity, usually working at 88-92 mph, and sometimes works in the lower side of that velocity band. But the pitch plays above its velo because he's incredibly deceptive, employing long arm action on the backside and an explosive delivery that enables him to induce a ton of whiffs inside the zone. He also demonstrates feel for throwing both a mid-70s curveball and a harder slider, with the latter projection as the better secondary pitch, and he'll also mix in a changeup. PERSON doesn't fit into a neat box as a right-hander who lacks physical projection, pitches with below-average velocity and lacks a put-away secondary pitch, but there's something to be said for the effectiveness of his fastball and the sustained success he's had as a result. Whether he's able to navigate Double- and Triple-A lineups should offer more insight into whether PERSON can stick as a starter, but the early returns are encouraging.",0
"PERSON was a potential 2015 first-round pick in his junior season at ORGANIZATION, but when he slid to the ORGANIZATION at ORGANIZATION. 35 overall, he opted to head back to school for his senior year. That decision didn't go as well as planned and after an uneven season, he ended up landing in the fourth round of the 2016 Draft. His pro debut that summer and the start of his first full season made it seem like the ORGANIZATION had gotten a serious bargain, though after earning a promotion to the ORGANIZATION State League and on the brink of getting moved to Double-A, he was shelved with elbow inflammation that ended his season.PERSON did come back to throw bullpens and got back on the mound around instructs without incident, giving the ORGANIZATION confidence he'll be good to go with a full workload in 2018. The right-hander will sit in the low 90s, but can reach back for 96-97 mph consistently when healthy. His slider has the chance to be a tick above average when all is said and done and his changeup has improved to give him another at least PERSON average offering. He still uses a fringy curve as a ""get-me-over"" different look for hitters. PERSON showed the ability to miss bats and induce weak contact on the ground in 2017, all while staying in and around the strike zone.The ORGANIZATION were extra cautious with PERSON last summer. With everything checked out as fine, the gloves came off a bit and he earned a promotion from Double- to Triple-A, with a ceiling of a mid-rotation starter.",0
"In trying to develop homegrown pitchers who can succeed in GPE, the Rockies have sought out groundball machines who keep the ball down in the zone. PERSON fits that description, collecting a GPE ORGANIZATION title with PERSON in his first full season in the process.The 6-foot-5 right-hander passes the eye test of a future big leaguer and has made progress in his overall pitchability since signing out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE. He uses his frame well to throw downhill with his sinking fastball that can touch 94 mph at times and get those all-important groundball outs. His changeup is his best secondary pitch and it has the chance to be an out pitch. His curveball is serviceable and his slider, while below-average, gives him a fourth option to choose from. While he doesn't miss that many bats and has been a little too hittable, he also doesn't hurt himself with walks.PERSON will get the chance to see how his pitching early to contact works as he moves up the ladder. If he can stay down in the zone consistently, he has the chance to be a back-end starter.",0
Another feel-to-hit and feel-for-the-game middle infielder that has fringy-to-average tools.,0
"One of the best high school position prospects in the 2013 Draft, PERSON saw his chances of going in the first round disappear when he tore the meniscus in his right knee in a season-opening doubleheader. The ORGANIZATION made a serious run at him after selecting him in the 22nd round, but they couldn't divert him from attending ORGANIZATION. After three strong seasons for the ORGANIZATION, the ORGANIZATION made PERSON the highest-drafted position player to come out of ORGANIZATION since PERSON in 2005 by selecting him in the second round in June.PERSON stood out for his ability to manage the strike zone and use the opposite field at ORGANIZATION, but he did neither consistently last summer during his pro debut. He has the bat speed and strength to generate average raw power, but it continues to surface more in batting practice than during games. PERSON has good speed but isn't as quick as he was in high school, and he'll need to make gains as a basestealer.PERSON can hold his own in center field, where he gets good jumps and takes efficient routes on fly balls. He saw time at all three spots during his pro debut, portending to a potential career as a fourth or fifth outfielder in the big leagues.",0
"ORGANIZATION worked mostly as a reliever during his first two years at ORGANIZATION before sliding into the starting rotation as a junior in 2014. The right-hander took to the role immediately, and the PERSON made him their fifth-round pick in June. He continued to make strides in his first full season, overcoming a shaky start at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Frederick to dominate during the second half and earn a late promotion to Double-A GPE. ORGANIZATION went 7-1 with 1.80 ERA over his final 12 regular-season starts and then starred in the LOCATION playoffs, winning both of his starts and allowing one earned run in 14 innings. Unfortunately for ORGANIZATION, he hasn't fared nearly as well this season in his return to GPE. ORGANIZATION' feel for pitching steadily improved in 2015, and by the end of the season he was pounding the zone with his entire four-pitch mix. His over-the-top release point helps him achieve consistent downhill plane with his fastball, which sits in the low to mid-90s and touches 97. Both his slider and curveball took a step forward last year, though neither projects to be above average, and he can get caught between them at times. He also has a serviceable changeup that plays against left-handed hitters. Questions remain about whether ORGANIZATION could remain a starter given his high-effort delivery and lack of an out pitch. But the significant improvement of his secondary pitches last season helped his cause, and club officials believe he can develop into at least a No. 4 starter.",0
"PERSON was probably the least exciting of the three top prospects from the ORGANIZATION July 2nd haul, behind PERSON and PERSON. PERSON falls into the bucket of heady, up-the-middle ORGANIZATION players with solid tools to go along with excellent in-game amateur performance. He is an above-average runner with an above-average arm and plus center field instincts, which makes him an above-average defender there. He'll likely grow into average raw power, but below-average game power due to a more gap-to-gap approach. PERSON has advanced feel to hit and held his own despite a higher strike out rate than expected in GPE as a 17-year-old, underlining the ORGANIZATION' confidence in his ability to make adjustments. The reasonable upside is a 2-3 WAR, solid regular in center field, which may not excite ORGANIZATION fans but would be an amazing return on his $1.5 million bonus.",0
"Every team in the big leagues would like a player like PERSON in their Minor League system.PERSON has a good build for a shortstop, and he has the defensive actions that will allow him to stay at there -- at least at the beginning of his professional career. Some scouts project that his body will force him to move from shortstop to third base, but there's also chance he stays at his original position. PERSON is a strong teenager. He has plus raw power and plus arm strength, and he's shown the ability to hit in games. It's his hit tool that has some scouts thinking that PERSON will be a middle-of-the-order type of player. Overall, he presents an interesting package of tools to scouts, but many evaluators want to see him display those talents more consistently. Other scouts believe he is the best all-around player in the class. PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION for $4 million.",0
"The D-backs had two of the first seven picks in the 2011 Draft, and they wasted no time grabbing high-end pitching. They took PERSON with the third overall pick, and then they selected PERSON four picks later. While PERSON is now in GPE's rotation, PERSON is on the cusp of reaching the big leagues with Arizona.PERSON throws his fastball in the mid 90s, and he can reach the upper 90s when he needs to. The steep downhill angle he throws from and the good sinking action on the pitch combine to produce a lot of ground balls. PERSON complements his plus fastball with an above-average 12-to-6 curveball, and a changeup that will likely be at least a Major League-average offering.PERSON has improved his command, and he earns praise for his demeanor on the mound. His stuff, size and makeup make him one of the best pitchers in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON soreness slowed PERSON's progress in the first half, but he has looked as good as ever since getting back on the mound.",1
"Not long ago, PERSON was thought of as one of the better up-and-coming young arms in the ORGANIZATION' system. In 2011, he was ranked No. 5 on their top 10, and even after a subpar '11 season, he was No. 16 on GPE's Top 20 when the '12 campaign began. Still just 21, PERSON struggled again during his second full season in the LOCATION. When he was sent down to the ORGANIZATION, the ORGANIZATION put him in the bullpen and he promptly struck out 14.7 per nine innings and held hitters to a .182 average, albeit at a low level. A team that likes to roll the dice might be intrigued by a power lefty arm out of the bullpen that can still miss plenty of bats.",0
" GPE is attempting to follow in the footsteps of PERSON and PERSON, as left-handers to go from pitching for the ORGANIZATION of GPE to appearing in the All-Star Game. After a solid first full professional season in the hitter friendly GPE, the 2013 second-rounder was included by the ORGANIZATION in their package they sent to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for PERSON. His first full season with his new organization has been a little up-and-down.GPE primarily relies on his fastball-slider combination. His fastball typically sat around 90 mph during his debut, but he's shown more velocity in the past and may be able to recapture it. His slider is his best pitch, and he can drop it in on the hands of left-handers or on the back foot of right-handers. His changeup has been a work in progress.There had been uncertainly whether PERSON could remain a starter like PERSON or follow PERSON' path to the bullpen. After 14 starters in Double-A in 2015, the ORGANIZATION started using the southpaw in relief and he seemed comfortable in the role.",0
"ORGANIZATION fans should get ready for another GPE to pitch in GPE very soon. PERSON is the nephew of former big leaguer PERSON, who spent several years pitching for the ORGANIZATION. He's knocking on the door, having reached Triple-A in 2012, though he missed considerable time with injuries. When he was on the mound, he continued to show tremendous stuff while developing a better feel for pitching. The arm strength has always been there and GPE shows a plus fastball, up to 96-97 mph. There's some sink to it as well and he gets a good amount of ground-ball outs as a result. He throws both a slider and a curve. The curve is better, especially when he stays on top it, throwing it with tight spin. The slider has a cutter action to it and both it and his changeup have the chance to be average pitches. If his command can continue to improve, he has the chance to contribute as a starter. If not, he'll definitely contribute out of the bullpen.",0
"GPE frame, average physical tools, approach/contact issues that might just be rust-related.",0
GPE works 88-92 with solid average stuff as a pitchability lefty that can eat innings. His slider has great whiff rates in the zone that gives him a high floor as a matchup reliever.,0
"PERSON was a tough sign out of an ORGANIZATION high school in 2014 due to a ORGANIZATION commitment and the ORGANIZATION made a significant offer that came up just short, but they got their man with the 5th overall pick in 2017 after a dominating three year career in GPE. PERSON had a rocky start in 2017, finding his arm slot weeks before the draft when he would take grounders at shortstop and found his natural slot was lower than where he'd been pitching. He pitched 95-99 mph for the first half of a start against Arkansas a few weeks later and hasn't looked back since; he likely won't spend long in the minor leagues and should join the ORGANIZATION young pitching in the big leagues at some point in 2018.",1
"PERSON was projected to be PERSON's top starter in 2014 before undergoing PERSON surgery, sidelining him for a part of the '15 season as well. However, he pitched well enough after his return to convince the FACILITY to select him in the fifth round of last year's Draft. PERSON healthy, PERSON impressed during his professional debut between the ORGANIZATION and GPE leagues and then followed it with a strong instructional league, showing a 93-96 mph fastball and a plus curveball. He also features a slider with average potential and has feel for a changeup. PERSON' 6-foot-1, 190-pound frame raises questions about his durability, though he hasn't had problems holding his velocity as a professional.While the FACILITY expect to deploy PERSON as a starter at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Winston-Salem in 2016, his two plus pitches also give him potential as a late-inning reliever, one who could move up the ladder quickly with a shift to the bullpen.",0
"After going undrafted as a ORGANIZATION high school senior in 2013, ORGANIZATION headed to the ORGANIZATION (Conn.) PERSON -- a prep school -- instead of college. The move paid off as he went in the third round in June and signed for $1 million.ORGANIZATION added strength during his year at ORGANIZATION, which helped boost his fastball from the upper 80s to the low 90s, with a high of 96 mph. He also has a hard curveball and could have two above-average pitches when he's fully developed. His changeup needs a lot of work but he shows the ability to throw all three of his offerings for strikes.ORGANIZATION is physically mature and doesn't have as much projection as the typical non-college Draft pick. However, he also has a frame for durability and the upside of a No. 3 starter.",0
"PERSON signed as an under-the-radar, 21-year-old GPE defector in July of 2017. The 2018 season was PERSON' first full year of baseball since the 2014-15 PERSON because his defection, international signing rules, and the 2017 offseason led to an eon between actual games for him. He was a college-aged player in the LOCATION in 2018 and had a mandatorily strong statistical season, hitting .366/.451/.548 with PERSON. He continued a strong bat-to-ball showing during instructional league, looked good at several different defensive positions, and was then firmly on the pro scouting radar. He got some reps with the big league team during '19 spring training. For now, he looks like a possible infield utility piece with some contact skills, but it might behoove GPE to hit the gas on his development and promotion to see if there could be more here.",0
"At this time last year, PERSON was a 40 FV and an interesting prospect to monitor. He was a slightly-built, shorter righty with a knockout fastball/curveball combination, who was moved very quickly as PERSON saw 2017 action in the ORGANIZATION, ORGANIZATION, and GPE league levels at age 18. We were eager to see if he could continue to perform like that in full-season ball as a 19-year-old and boy, did he. PERSON had an ORGANIZATION under 3.00 at each of his three stops last year: eight Low-A starts, five in Hi-A (one of which is the linked video), and one in Double-A. PERSON's changeup and command both ended up playing better than we expected, with his changeup regularly flashing average to above -- confirming he has starter's stuff -- and his command sufficient to deal with A-ball hitters. The concerns about his durability tied to his stature are still there. He's 5-foot-10 and anywhere from 163 to 175 pounds. He threw 74.0 innings last year and even scouts who love PERSON concede he may not be a 170 to 200-inning type of arm. Instead, he may be in the PERSON or PERSON mold, where you'll get 125 - 135 innings and hopefully have him healthy enough to fill whatever role fits the staff best in the playoffs. PERSON and ORGANIZATION are 55 or 60 FV types, so that's likely PERSON's upside if things break right. 
PERSON is a very good athlete, which is what allows him to repeat his delivery, throw so many strikes, and have at least average command despite a delivery that has crossfire, recoil, and effort at release. We're hesitant to knock PERSON's delivery simply because it's unusual, or due to his size, because his performance at this age has also been remarkable. He has a rising fastball with which he operates up in the zone, and he knows exactly how to use his high spin curveball, which has been over 3000 rpm at times. A well-located fastball up, a high-spin curveball down, and a changeup down to keep hitters honest is a good combo, and PERSON knows how to use them in sequence to set up hitters. There's some question about his approach being too simplistic to work at the big league level, but again, we would bet on PERSON figuring out how to make it work. He'll open 2019 in Double-A and could be good enough to crack the ORGANIZATION bullpen late in the season.",0
"PERSON considered PERSON one of the top defensive outfielders in the 2016 prep class, but his lack of profile tools and commitment to PERSON left him undrafted. A three-year starter in center for the ORGANIZATION, he was their best hitter at the 2018 College World Series, where they lost to PERSON in the finals. As with his older brother PERSON, an infielder with the ORGANIZATION, his skills still stand out more than his pure physical ability, but those skills and his track record of production could get him drafted in the top three rounds. PERSON's best attribute is his play in center field. Though he's a fringy runner out of the batter's box, he's quicker once he gets going and has tremendous instincts that allow him to track down balls from gap to gap. He has displayed plus arm strength in the past, though it has played closer to average in 2019.PERSON has a power-based approach at the plate, and his strength and aggressive, pull-conscious mentality could produce 15-20 homers per season. He doesn't have the smoothest left-handed swing and he's a streaky hitter, but he makes consistent contact and should hit for a decent average. He has shown improved discipline at the plate this spring, though his offensive package may fit better for a fourth outfielder than an everyday player.",0
"While the 2013 season was a lost one for PERSON, both because of performance and injury, he still might have as much upside as anyone in the ORGANIZATION' system.A broken wrist cost PERSON the second half of 2013, and he missed the first six weeks of '14 as he recovered from a ruptured Achilles tendon suffered during the offseason. Now that PERSON is back in action, he's once again trying to maximize his raw tools. Speed is his best asset, and he has plenty of it to spare. It will help PERSON in his new position, as he moves from shortstop to the outfield, where he played in high school.If the switch-hitter can stay on the field and mature as hoped, PERSON could end up being a dynamic top-of-the-order catalyst in the future.",1
"The ORGANIZATION doubled up on GPE prep hurlers in the 2014 Draft, taking left-hander PERSON in the first round followed by PERSON in the 12th. While PERSON was the more highly touted prospect at that time, it's been PERSON who has enjoyed the most success as a pro. He impressed during his full-season debut in the Class A ORGANIZATION and built on that performance in 2017 Class A Advanced GPE, posting a 2.51 ERA that paced all GPE League hurlers with at least 100 innings pitched. With PERSON's arrow pointing in the right direction, the ORGANIZATION acquired him, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON from PERSON for outfielder PERSON. PERSON has seen his stuff and overall pitchability improve in each of his four seasons. He compensates for being undersized with a high-spin-rate fastball that sits 89-93 mph and induces whiffs in and above the zone. PERSON's breaking ball is his best secondary pitch, flashing plus at times with late downer action, and he exhibits feel for a promising changeup. His entire arsenal plays up because he's a good strike-thrower, though he's likely to be challenged in that regarded against upper-level hitters.PERSON's swing-and-miss fastball, combined with his two average-or-better secondary offerings, gives him a chance to be successful against hitters on both sides of the plate, which he was in 2017. That he's an undersized righty who lacks a plus pitch leads some to peg PERSON as a future reliever, but he's passed every test in his career thus far.",1
"While he's limited on defense, ORGANIZATION has one of the more visually beautiful swings in the draft and has flashed feel for spraying fly balls to all fields. He might need to grow into more power to profile in left field than is currently projected, so there's very little margin for error here.",0
"A broken foot delayed PERSON's professional debut until 2013, but it proved to be worth the wait. He led the GPE League in ORGANIZATION and was then promoted to short-season Vancouver, where he was named the ORGANIZATION of the LOCATION playoffs.PERSON has big raw power and can be a physical presence in the middle of the lineup. He's not just a masher, however. His quick hands help him make consistent, hard contact and he has an advanced approach at the plate.PERSON has a strong arm and despite his fringy range, has a chance to stay at third base. No matter where he plays defensively, his bat will be the main attraction.",0
"PERSON had a strong 2018 (153 innings, 147 K, 39 BB, 53% GB%) repeating Low-A as a 21-year-old. He's a husky, low-slot, pitchability lefty with a rainbow curveball and average changeup. The changeup may need to get a bit better to keep righties from teeing off on his fastball, but PERSON also hides the ball really well and can throw his curveball for strikes in fastball counts, so perhaps he already does enough to make the lack of velocity matter less. He profiles as an inning-eating No. 5 starter or long reliever.",0
"Getting PERSON alone in the ORGANIZATION trade with the Athletics in July 2014 would have been a coup for the GPE. They also got a second first-rounder in ORGANIZATION, who signed for $1.8 million as the 24th overall choice in 2013, and then sent him to GPE in a package to acquire PERSON from the ORGANIZATION a week before the 2016 PERSON. He reached Double-A at age 20 last May and performed well before fouling a ball off his right knee and sustaining a hairline fracture of his kneecap in mid-August. For most of his pro career, ORGANIZATION has displayed a quick left-handed swing, tremendous hand-eye coordination and mature approach. But he hasn't looked the same in 2016, with his bat appearing slower as he has made less hard contact than usual. He draws enough walks to record healthy on-base percentages, though some evaluators question how much over-the-fence power he'll develop. Most of ORGANIZATION's value comes from his bat. He's a decent athlete with fringy speed and arm strength, which doesn't make him much of a factor on the bases or in the outfield. Though he broke into pro ball in center field and has played mostly in right since coming to the GPE, he fits best in left.",1
" A shortstop in high school, PERSON has played both short and third during his pro debut with the A's, though most feel the hot corner will be his ultimate destination. He should be a solid defender across the board at third, with good hands and a strong arm. PERSON can swing the bat well and projects to hit for average and with a decent amount of power. While he's not fast, he's a very good baserunner who knows when to be aggressive. His makeup and intensity are off the charts and he and fellow 2012 PERSON could man the left side of GPE's infield together in the future.",1
"PERSON signed with the D-backs for $1.85 million at the outset of last year's international period after he had ranked as the ORGANIZATION. 19 prospect in his class. He impressed evaluators as a GPE amateur with a combination of athleticism and overall tools that could help him stick in center field. PERSON has a pair of standout tools in his speed -- he was clocked at showcases in the 6.6- to 6.7-second range in the 60-yard run -- and arm strength that might have been the best among players in his class and is expected get even stronger as he develops. Projecting his impact at the plate will require more time, as PERSON won't make his pro debut until 2019, but he shows the signs of having the requisite athleticism and skills to develop a promising speed-power combo. PERSON is all projection right now, but he has the type of athletic body scouts covet, not to mention defensive abilities that could keep him on the field even when he struggles at the plate.",1
"PERSON was a senior sign out of GPE in 2018 after a couple years of production in the ORGANIZATION, but the frame, tools and how he did it didn't excite scouts. He's made some important adjustments to his offensive approach this year to unlock the utility of his tools and now has a shot to be a bench outfielder.",0
"PERSON has long been on the national scouting radar, standing out as a prep underclass third baseman in GPE,  but his age and contact issues pushed him to ORGANIZATION. He barely played as a freshman, was solid as a sophomore, then broke out as a 22-year-old junior, hitting 19 homers en route to a .996 OPS while also posting top-of-the-scale amateur exit velocities as he grew into easy plus raw power. 
Since he signed as a 22-year-old and is a corner-based, power-over-hit bat, PERSON needed to perform quickly but a broken hamate limited his 2018 and may keep him from getting to that power in games until later in 2019. He is a fine right fielder and good athlete, but is just fringy defensively, so the pressure is on for his age-24 season, with only 47 career games at full-season levels.",0
"Though international amateurs are eligible once they turn 16, PERSON didn't get picked up by the ORGANIZATION until he was 18 1/2 in October 2012. He has yet to get past Rookie ball and worked just 15 1/3 innings last season because of a tired arm, so he hasn't generated much hype. But he's one of the hardest throwers in GPE's system.In his limited game action, PERSON hit 100 mph and worked at 95-97 mph. He also has an advanced changeup and some feel for spinning the ball, though he's still trying to find a comfortable grip for his slider. His command is work in progress, though he does a decent job of throwing strikes.Between his velocity and his size -- he's 6-foot-7 and carries maybe 50 pounds more than his listed 190 -- PERSON presents an extremely intimidating figure on the mound. He'll have frontline starter stuff if he can develop a good breaking ball, and he's still a potential closer if he doesn't.",0
"The desire to find good college catching coincided nicely with PERSON's return from a torn left thumb ligament as the ORGANIZATION of GPE backstop was moving up ORGANIZATION boards as he showed his all-around skills.When PERSON first returned, he was DHing, giving him time to show what he can do with the bat. He has some bat speed with a solid overall approach, and he was showing the ability to hit for both average and power post-injury. Then he got back behind the plate and reminded scouts he has solid catch-and-throw skills as well. He has a plus arm that controls the running game, moves very well behind the plate and has outstanding hands. PERSON's performance since he returned had him moving into conversations about the best college backstops in the class. He could hear his name come off the board in the first three rounds as a result.",0
"The younger brother of one-time phenom PERSON, PERSON didn't quite get the $4.25 million payday his brother got from the A's in 2008, but the ORGANIZATION did see enough in him to give him $800,000 to sign in 2014. A decent pro debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2015 turned into a fantastic GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION League the following season. He didn't back it up as much in 2017 with a move to the GPE, but the ORGANIZATION liked his arm enough to get him from the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION trade just before the July non-waiver PERSON Deadline.PERSON offers an interesting three-pitch mix, with an advanced feel for how to use it for his age, coming from a strong and durable body. He touched 94-95 mph with his fastball at times and he could get there more consistently as he gets stronger. He throws a slurvy breaking ball around 80 mph, with some thinking it might eventually evolve into a solid slider. His changeup is ahead of his breaking ball and he has a pretty good feel for it. Considering his delivery is still raw and he's trying to get to a point where he repeats it consistently, PERSON is capable of throwing a lot of strikes.With his pitchability, solid stuff and good pitcher's frame, PERSON has all of the ingredients to be a starting pitcher. There are refinements to be made, in both command and breaking stuff, but there could be plenty more to come from this young right-hander.",1
" Making his full-season debut in 2011, PERSON was the one pitcher in the system who finished the season with a lower ERA than A.J. PERSON, leading the organization and finishing fourth in the ORGANIZATION. He returned to GPE in 2012, though, after struggling at ORGANIZATION A Advanced PERSON and then dealing with a hamstring and oblique injury. The ORGANIZATION product looks the part, at 6-foot-4, and he still has solid stuff, with a sinking fastball that can touch the mid-90s and generate a lot of ground-ball outs. He also throws an average slider and has a changeup, though both are behind the sinker, and the changeup is below average.",0
"If not for a hyperextended elbow that shelved him for several months in 2018, PERSON wouldn't be on this list. (The injury to PERSON was also part of why GPE pushed PERSON along quickly.) In the 2017 Fall League (he missed some time that season due to hamstring tightness), he looked both readier and nearly as talented as fellow Fall Leaguer PERSON, and it seemed certain that he'd be up for good at some point the following spring. But in April an awkward dive on a shallow fly ball that most center fielders wouldn't even have sniffed at bent PERSON' elbow backward and based on the way he writhed around in pain, the injury appeared catastrophic. X-rays were negative and an ORGANIZATION showed no structural damage, but PERSON didn't start swinging a bat for a month and a half and was out of game action for three. He spent July and August rehabbing before a great September in GPE, during which he slashed .288/.348/.525. This is a do-everything center fielder who glides from gap to gap, has runner-halting arm strength, and plus-plus speed that is aided by seemingly sixth-sense instincts on the bases. PERSON has middling bat speed and doesn't generate huge exit velocity, but he has above-average hand-eye coordination, bat control, and pitch recognition, and a gap-to-gap approach that suits his speed. He'll slug on paper by turning the line drives he slaps into the gaps in to extra bases. PERSON has slightly below-average plate discipline, which may dilute his production for a bit, but he projects as a 3-plus WAR center fielder with a skillset akin to PERSON's, and he's big league ready right now.",1
"The state of GPE features two of the best college shortstops in this year's Draft. PERSON's PERSON looks like a lock to go in the first 10 picks, while PERSON is a projected second-rounder who should supplant PERSON as the highest-drafted position player ever from GPE-Lafayette.Thought he played third and second base in deference to PERSON on the GPE collegiate national team last summer, PERSON is capable of sticking at shortstop in pro ball. He has range to both sides, reliable hands and a strong arm. He tends to flip sidearm throws to first base, however, costing him some zip and accuracy.PERSON has well above-average speed but sometimes gets too power-conscious, which leads to swing and misses and harmless flyouts. He'll need to improve his pitch recognition and learn to tone down his approach to take better advantage of his quickness.",0
"In three years at GPE, PERSON pitched almost exclusively in relief. As a junior, he closed games for the GPE, picking up 10 saves along the way. The D-backs took a flier on him in the 23rd round of the 2017 Draft and he spent his first summer and the first chunk of his first full year pitching in relief. He got an opportunity to start in May and has run with it, earning a promotion from the GPE to the GPE League.PERSON has the chance to have three usable pitches when all is said and done. His bread-and-butter is his heavy sinker that sits in the low 90s and touches 95 mph at times. His ability to command the pitch consistently down in the zone allows it to play up and is the reason he has one of the highest ground-ball rates in all of the ORGANIZATION. His secondary stuff is developing, with a changeup a bit ahead of an improving slider.There's a chance PERSON ends up back in a bullpen when all is said and done, the kind of reliever who can come in and get a big groundball or double play. But he'll continue to get the chance to start as long as he keeps excelling in that role.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the third round of the 2017 Draft, the hope was the ORGANIZATION State PERSON product would be the kind of advanced college starter who could move rapidly through the system. While he did struggle a bit when he first got there, he did live up to his advanced billing by reaching Double-A in his first full season.PERSON is all about mixing his pitches, his overall feel for pitching and his command, rather than pure stuff, with three offerings that typically grade out as average. He will show an above-average fastball on occasion, with a tweak to his delivery helping him add a tick, though he usually sits in the 90-93 range. He mixes in his average changeup effectively and he'll show an average breaking ball. His ability to keep hitters guessing and fill up the strike zone will continue to be key for him moving forward.After initially struggling in GPE, PERSON made solid adjustments and pitched very well over the season's final month. If he can continue to show that kind of command and crispness of his pitches, he'll be ready to impact the back end of the ORGANIZATION rotation soon now that he's put the injury in his rearview mirror.",0
"PERSON returned from PERSON surgery to pace ORGANIZATION USA in strikeouts and innings in 2015, the same year that the A's took the Alabama-Birmingham hurler in the 20th round. Though he reached Triple-A while pitching at four levels last year in his first full professional season, PERSON's shining moment came the next year in the ORGANIZATION finals, when he tossed six scoreless frames to lead Double-A GPE to its third straight title. PERSON helped the ORGANIZATION secure yet another title in 2017, though he also spent two months on the disabled list with an oblique injury.PERSON relies heavily on his sinker, a low-90s offering that he consistently commands down in the zone and that has netted him twice as many ground-ball outs than air outs in his career. He can manipulate the pitch, too, at times imparting cutting action in order to keep hitters true. His slider is an average offering, thrown in the upper 70s, and he'll also mix in a firm changeup that grades as his least advanced offering. PERSON's arsenal plays up thanks to his strike-throwing ability and bulldog mentality on the mound.Outside of the injury that sidelined him in 2017, PERSON has proven plenty durable during his professional career. He also receives high praise for his defense -- he was a Minor League Gold Glove winner in 2016 -- and feel for controlling the running game. PERSON will continue to be developed as a starter, but he also could reach the Majors quickly in a bullpen role, possibly as a long reliever, thanks to his excellent ground-ball tendencies.",0
"PERSON went under the radar coming out of ORGANIZATION Prep in GPE in 2012, and he didn't raise his profile much in his first full professional season with the D-backs. That changed in 2014 when PERSON reached base in 74 consecutive games, setting a new Minor League record. The ORGANIZATION thought enough of him to make sure he was part of the deal that sent PERSON to GPE in November.One of the keys to the record was PERSON's improved approach at the plate. Armed with a better awareness of the strike zone, he has become a more disciplined hitter, though there is still some swing-and-miss in his game. PERSON generates good bat speed, but his small size limits his power output. His improved on-base skills and his plus speed make him an ideal fit at the top of the order.Defensively, PERSON is still learning the infield after playing mostly center field in high school. He has good range and a strong arm, and he could develop into a solid defender in time.",1
"PERSON had put his 50-game suspension for marijuana in 2016 behind him, making a huge impact in the big leagues in '16, both as a starter and out of the bullpen. He was going to be counted on to have a large role on the 2017 Cardinals' pitching staff but instead will spend the year rehabbing after being diagnosed with a torn UCL in his pitching elbow in February and undergoing PERSON surgery.When he's healthy, PERSON is arguable the best pitching prospect in the game, with his combination of elite stuff and missing bats all pointing to a future as a frontline starter. His fastball sits in the mid-to-upper-90s comfortably and he can reach back for more, hitting triple digits at times, something that happened consistently in relief outings. He backs that up with a nasty curve he'll throw in the upper 70s that also elicits swings and misses. PERSON actually threw his improving changeup, 88-90 mph, more frequently than his breaking ball during his time in the big leagues, with tremendous success.Command had been the only thing that had held PERSON back, with a walk rate of 4.5 per nine innings in his career, though most felt that would improve over time. The track record for ORGANIZATION surgery recovery is good, but it's going to take time for PERSON to build himself back into the star all envisioned.",1
"Back in 2014, PERSON was considered the best bat, high school or college, in the GPE class and went No. 6 overall to the ORGANIZATION, who immediately moved the prep catcher to the outfield so his bat could carry him. He had trouble gaining any traction, and following a 2016 season in the ORGANIZATION, the ORGANIZATION sent him to the ORGANIZATION in the trade for PERSON and PERSON. PERSON moved PERSON back behind the plate, and while he hasn't hit consistently, he did make it to Triple-A in 2018 and was added to the 40-man roster in the offseason and made his big league debut in 2019.Since joining the ORGANIZATION, PERSON's power has shown up on occasion, hitting 19 homers in 2017, then five more in the ORGANIZATION that offseason. That didn't carry over to 2018, where his approach regressed and his strikeout rate jumped over 30 percent, keeping him from tapping into his plus raw pop. On the positive side, PERSON's work behind the plate has improved markedly. He's always had a strong arm but had struggled with receiving. His blocking remains a work in progress, and given his size, he's not very agile. He has gotten better at framing after watching a lot of video of fellow ORGANIZATION catcher PERSON, who is similarly built.PERSON is still only 23 years old, but his ceiling is very limited. At this point, PERSON's best path to the big leagues is as a power-only backup backstop with decent catch and throw skills.",1
"Plus makeup, low-tomid-90s fastball, average curveball with vertical action. PERSON bounced back and forth between rotation and bullpen each of the last two years.",0
"After a solid redshirt sophomore season at ORGANIZATION State in 2016, PERSON was drafted by the ORGANIZATION in the 38th round and nearly signed before opting to head back to school. That decision paid off as he hit his way into first-round consideration, and the ORGANIZATION were happy to take him again in 2017, this time with the 35th overall pick in the GPE. He made it up to the ORGANIZATION State League during his summer debut and managed to finish second in the system in home runs.During his final season at ORGANIZATION, PERSON changed his set up at the plate, learning to use his lower half more and shortening up his stroke. It made him a better overall hitter, one who could tap into his considerable raw power more consistently, and that carried over into his pro debut. A total of 18 homers in 62 games might be too much to ask long term, but the ORGANIZATION feel PERSON's plus power is legit and will continue to play. There's some swing and miss to his game, but he also draws walks. A first baseman in college, the ORGANIZATION sent the deceptively athletic PERSON to left field during his pro debut, and that's where he'll continue to get the bulk of his playing time.The ORGANIZATION have typically been a bit more methodical in the past in terms of development, but PERSON's skills at the plate should allow him to test that and continue to move quickly towards Minnesota.",0
"GPE was known about PERSON when the ORGANIZATION made him the ORGANIZATION. 72 overall pick in 2014 out of ORGANIZATION State CC, but he's since emerged as one of the better pitching prospects in the Minors while making a quick climb through PERSON's system. PERSON reached Double-A for the first time in his second full season and then returned there to begin 2017 before advancing to Triple-A in mid-April and ultimately helping PERSON win the Governor's Cup. Along the way, PERSON was named the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON as the U.S. PERSON's starting pitcher, furthering his reputation as a confident, big-game hurler. However, PERSON will now be sidelined until 2019 after he suffered a right elbow injury in February '18 that required PERSON surgery. PERSON has no shortage of weapons at his disposal, as he'll show the ability to execute five distinct pitches in a given outing. He throws his fastball in the low to mid-90s, at times touching 95-96 mph, with late sinking action and backs it with a host of secondary offerings, including his trademark screwball as well as a plus changeup. His feel for commanding his above-average slider down in the zone gives him yet another out pitch, while his curveball represents a quality change-of-pace offering.Throwing strikes has never been a problem for PERSON. His natural athleticism, smooth mechanics and repeatable delivery all work in harmony to allow him to pound the zone consistently, and club officials note that his command has improved as he's climbed the ORGANIZATION ladder. PERSON is also a fearless competitor on the mound, and he receives raves for his ability to mix pitches, set up hitters and execute a game plan.",0
"Sometimes a player who enters his GPE season as the best player in the class struggles with the pressure and the spotlight. Then there are players like PERSON, who has somehow managed to surpass expectations during his junior season at FACILITY after helping the ORGANIZATION win the ORGANIZATION World Series and earning ORGANIZATION Most Outstanding Player honors in the process. He capped things off by being a member of ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION over the summer and has kept on rolling on both sides of the ball this spring.The switch-hitting backstop is the complete package at and behind the plate. He has an advanced approach at the plate, walking more than he's struck out at FACILITY, with the ability to make consistent, hard contact and drive the ball from both sides of the plate. He'd been more of a gap-to-gap doubles hitter, but the over-the-fence power started to show up more during his junior season. PERSON is also outstanding behind the plate, with excellent hands, agility and a very strong throwing arm. He's even a better runner than some give him credit for. With his all-around skills at a premium position while playing at the pinnacle of college baseball, PERSON will be at the forefront of all conversations for the top pick in the GPE. The last time the ORGANIZATION took a switch-hitting college backstop with their first pick, PERSON, it worked out pretty well.",0
"GPE isn't especially exciting, as he has a swing that emphasizes contact and allows almost no power, but he's hit everywhere (he won two Cape batting titles), he's a plus runner and he can play shortstop.",0
"PERSON entered the spring with a chance to follow in the footsteps of PERSON, PERSON and PERSON as a GPE high school outfielder selected in the top 10 picks. Though his tools were among the best of any of this year's prepsters, he didn't perform as well as scouts had hoped, and he fell to the second round, where PERSON grabbed him 51st overall.PERSON made waves on the showcase circuit last summer, running a 6.43-second 60-yard dash, clocking 100 mph on a throw from the outfield and working at 91-94 mph from the mound. He has an explosive swing to match his athleticism, giving him above-average raw power.PERSON struggles to make consistent contact, especially against premium pitching. His combination of speed and power makes him an enticing prospect, if he is able to hone his hitting ability as a professional.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have both been burned by and benefited from ORGANIZATION investigations into the identities of GPE GPE pitchers. They originally signed PERSON for $160,000 in 2009, but they didn't have him cleared by ORGANIZATION, and they saw him go to the ORGANIZATION for $1.5 million. Conversely, the ORGANIZATION signed ORGANIZATION for $400,000 in '11, only to see him run afoul of ORGANIZATION and land with GPE for $800,000 a year later.One of the hardest throwers in the system, ORGANIZATION hit 100 mph during a dazzling Spring Training. After working mostly at 92-95 mph, he's showing more velocity more consistently this year, now that he's recovered from an injury to his right middle finger that plagued him in 2013. ORGANIZATION is also snapping off more impressive power breaking balls, now that he's healthy.ORGANIZATION throws strikes with three pitches, giving him a chance to make it as a big league starter, if he can refine his changeup. With ORGANIZATION' power repertoire, he also has the makings of a late-inning relief option.",0
"Back in 2010, PERSON had scouts checking out the ORGANIZATION of PERSON outfield regularly, eventually going in the second round. Now it's O'Neill's turn.Paul O'Neill's nephew really knows how to hit, making consistent hard contact and spraying line drives to all fields. He has mostly doubles power, with some room to add strength, and average speed, though he's smart on the basepaths. He should be a solid average defender.It's not clear where O'Neill profiles, with not quite enough speed for center and not enough power for a corner, but his ability to hit at the college level will certainly help him on GPE day.",0
"PERSON's PERSON value suffered in 2013 because of an inconsistent season at ORGANIZATION, particularly in the control department. He has the chance to be a fourth-round steal for the GPE, though command issues continue to follow the left-hander.At 6-foot-3 and 180 pounds, PERSON has good size and a projectable frame. His fastball grades out as a bit above-average, but he's touched the mid 90s and might get there more consistently in the future. He features a solid downer curveball, with good bite, and a changeup, both of which have potential, but also aren't thrown consistently. Finding the strike zone will be key for PERSON to reach his potential, as he walked four per nine innings during his full-season debut in 2014 and 3.3 per nine in '15.Better command will lead to better results and allow PERSON to reach his potential as a mid-rotation starter. If he can start filling the strike zone, he could start moving a little more quickly.",0
"An undersized right-hander taken in the 2015 Draft from GPE State in GPE, many ticketed PERSON for the bullpen. While that might eventually be his long-term home, he's shown enough weapons to keep developing as a starter for now.PERSON has picked up some velocity since joining the ORGANIZATION organization, and he now sits in the 93-95 mph range, with the ability to reach back and touch as high as 98 mph on occasion. His low 80s curveball continues to improve and will flash above average to plus on occasion. PERSON continues to work on his changeup, which might be an average pitch when all is said and done, and he's working in a new cutter, with slider-like action, this season. PERSON has the weapons to be a starter, and the ORGANIZATION will continue to let him pitch in a rotation. But they also know his power fastball-curve combination could play up even more in a relief role and get him to the big leagues faster.",0
"PERSON is the son of former big league slugger PERSON and PERSON came onto the showcase circuit late due to PERSON surgery, but performed well this spring, flashing power and feel to hit.",0
"PERSON won one game as a sophomore before becoming the ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year as a junior in 2014. The ORGANIZATION drafted him in the third round, making him ORGANIZATION's highest pick in a decade, and signed him for $576,100.His long frame prompts comparisons to PERSON, though PERSON is a bit taller and skinnier and much more of a finesse pitcher. He has better body control than most 6-foot-7 pitchers, allowing him to throw three pitches for strikes.PERSON's 88-92 mph fastball with life and his 77-82 mph slider are average offerings, while his fading changeup could be in time. He uses his size and high three-quarters delivery to stay on top of his pitches and deliver them with steep downward plane. He has a ceiling of a No. 4 starter, perhaps more if he can add some strength and velocity.",0
"PERSON stood out most of the summer as a first round type of shortstop with 50 or 55 tools across the board. He had a slow start this spring and has been a little tougher to see than the typical prospect in the southeast, because you have to fly to GPE the day before and then only get one game a day, when you could easily have 5-6 quality games if you hung around major metro areas like PERSON or GPE for the same period. PERSON has interest as high as GPE at 19, and likely goes by the ORGANIZATION picks at 33 and 34.",1
"GPE, physically mature and athletic, PERSON was bringing scouts to GPE because of his three-pitch mix and his pitchability. The high schooler, who has committed to the ORGANIZATION of GPE, will throw his fastball up to 92 mph consistently. When his mechanics on his curveball are solid, it's an above-average strikeout pitch. And his changeup will show flashes of having some sink with good arm speed. He goes right after hitters and works quickly, always a plus. He may not be the tall, thin projectable type, but what he is right now is already good enough to warrant early-round attention.",0
"The burly PERSON offered huge raw power as a GPE high schooler, but teams preferred him on the mound. The ORGANIZATION were part of that consensus, making him a full-time pitcher after paying him $550,000 as a 14th-round pick in 2011. After finally emerging as one of the best arms among starting prospects in the system in 2015, PERSON was one of four prospects dealt to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON in December.PERSON usually operates at 92-94 mph and can reach 96 with his fastball, which has some cutting action that makes it even more difficult to hit. He spins a hard curveball that shows promise as a second pitch. His changeup will fade and dive at times, though it can be too firm at times.PERSON exhibits decent control but spotty command. His best long-term role could be as a reliever, and his fastball might approach triple digits in shorter stints.",1
"It can be difficult for a high schooler from a place like ORGANIZATION to measure up to his contemporaries in places like GPE or GPE, but PERSON took some serious steps in that direction over the summer, playing for PERSON, where he had mixed results as the 18 and under squadâs leadoff hitter, while also participating in the ORGANIZATION Games and PERSON All-American Classic.Toolsy and athletic, he has the chance to be a complete player, though heâs not as advanced as some of the prep outfielders who get to play more baseball.While his ORGANIZATION experience, playing in GPE in the ORGANIZATION AAA/18U World Championships, was up-and-down, PERSON was the ORGANIZATION of the PERSON All-American Classic, going 2-for-3 with a triple for the LOCATION team.",0
"The ORGANIZATION of GPE has produced some good pitching talent over the years, from first-rounder PERSON in 2007 to PERSON, the ORGANIZATION. 5 pick in the 2012 Draft. And while he might not quite be at that level, GPE has the chance to follow that duo's lead in 2013.USF's Saturday starter has the chance to have three Major League average or better pitches, with a fastball that touches 93 mph with some sink, a sharp slider that has good bite when he stays on top of it and a deceptive changeup with fade and sink. There's room for strength in GPE's 6-foot-6 frame, and with some improved command, he has the chance to be a big league starter in the future.",0
"PERSON experienced an unexpected velocity spike as a 24-year-old, his heater creeping into the 93-97 range after it was 92-94 the year before. He also drastically improved his slider, which he lacked feel for just after signing, and he now looks like a standard fastball/slider middle relief prospect in most outings, though remember that PERSON also throws a knuckle changeup -- coined 'The Critter' by PERSON, the only other guy we know who throws it -- which he has de-emphasized as the slider has emerged.",0
"There are few, if any, high school bats better than ORGANIZATION's. With a balanced approach and a smooth swing from the left side, he projects to be a plus hitter with above-average power.He's an average runner, at best, and will be limited to a corner outfield spot, but that's just fine, as his bat will play there without question.The only thing that might be better than his hitting skills is his makeup. He plays the game the right way and is very competitive.ORGANIZATION's character combined with his bat should get him off the board fairly early.",1
"Most clubs believed PERSON was committed on going to college at GPE, so he dropped to the 16th round of the 2011 Draft. The ORGANIZATION knew otherwise and signed him for $150,000. He has been their most consistent starting pitching prospect ever since and thrived in Double-A last year at age 21.PERSON physically resembles PERSON, and like PERSON he relies on his ability to command and mix his pitches to succeed. His ability to replicate his low-effort delivery allows him to pound the bottom of the strike zone and generate plenty of harmless groundballs.PERSON's feel for pitching stands out more than any of his individual offerings. His downer curveball is his lone above-average pitch. He works around 89-90 mph with his sinking fastball but can reach back for 93 on occasion, and he also has feel for a changeup and a slider.",0
"PERSON is one of many whiff-heavy corner bats with huge power who floats around the upper levels of the minors, putting up big power numbers while struggling to find a big league role if their parent club has someone at 1B/DH. The ORGANIZATION have tried PERSON in the outfield but scouts don't think he's playable out there. PERSON has the advantage of hitting left-handed, but unless the ORGANIZATION make a concerted effort to give him reps soon (they demoted him to Double-A to start 2019, so not a great sign) he'll probably bounce around on waivers until a team with 40-man space -- and the time to see whether or not PERSON can hit big league pitching -- gives him a chance. Sometimes this is how clubs fall into PERSON and PERSON, but it's also the fate of many a Quad-A hitter.",0
"A two-way player at GPE (Mo.) JC, PERSON went to the Twins in the 31st round of the 2014 Draft as a left-handed pitcher but turned them down to transfer to PERSON. After performing much better at the plate than on the mound with the Shockers, he signed for $100,000 when the ORGANIZATION selected him in the 15th round as an outfielder in 2015. He led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with 83 RBIs during his first full pro season while showing better power and speed than he did as an amateur.PERSON's left-handed raw power, speed and arm strength all grade as plus tools. His 6-foot-5 frame creates impressive leverage that he could utilize better by adding more loft to his swing. His extra-large frame comes with a naturally long swing, and he needs a more consistent approach after striking out in 30 percent of his plate appearances during his first two pro seasons.PERSON is surprisingly fast for a big man and has 20-20 potential. He runs well enough to cover ground in center field but fits better on the corners. His arm, which provided 88-92 mph fastballs in college, works anywhere in the outfield.",0
"Rather than being one of the oldest prep players in the 2014 Draft class, PERSON expedited his graduation and was granted eligibility for the '13 Draft by PERSON, leading to his selection by the Nationals in the third round. The GPE native had an impressive full-season debut the following year as a teenager in the ORGANIZATION A GPE ORGANIZATION, but failed to take a step forward at ORGANIZATION A Advanced ORGANIZATION in 2015, and then had a subpar showing in the ORGANIZATION. He got back on track in 2016, though, earning All-Star honors at ORGANIZATION before moving up to Double-A at age 21. PERSON's approach has been more advanced and consistent than anticipated; he's proven to be a patient hitter who sees a lot of pitches and takes his walks, though his knack for working deep counts, on top of his natural swing-and-miss tendencies, has led to high strikeout totals to begin his career. And while raw power was his calling card as an amateur, the left-handed hitter has struggled to apply it in games as a pro.After playing shortstop in high school, PERSON was shifted to third base upon turning pro, where he shows an above-average arm. However, some scouts already doubt that he'll be able to stick at the position long term, with his stiff actions and below-average range portending an eventual move to first base.",0
"The question isn't if PERSON can pitch. It's whether he will be a starter or pitch out of the bullpen one day. The most skeptical scouts wonder if he will throw enough strikes.Here's why: PERSON is an especially hard thrower. His fastball has been clocked as 97 mph and it's not uncommon for him to sit at 94-95. That type of velocity is rare in any market and not surprisingly, some scouts wonder if he will be able to command the high velocity on a consistent basis. But his skill is extraordinary, and PERSON is the type of pitcher any club would like to put it in its system, though the Marlins have emerged as the favorites to sign him.In terms of secondary pitches, the belief is that those will develop once he signs with a team and receives daily instruction in an academy.PERSON gave up one hit, struck out a batter and walked one at ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION in February. He didn't show his best fastball or command.The right-handed pitcher is from GPE, GPE, and trains with PERSON.",0
"PERSON took another step forward in his incremental development in 2014, earning an in-season promotion for the first time. While he struggled in Double-A, he performed well in the ORGANIZATION, setting him up for a big 2015.PERSON has the best bat speed in the ORGANIZATION system, which helps him deliver solid pop. His power tool is greater than his hit tool right now, but he has started to make changes to his approach, cutting down on his aggressiveness at the plate some, giving him the chance to be an average hitter as well. PERSON will continue to see most of his time defensively at shortstop, where he shows flashes of solid skills but needs to work on his consistency. He's played a good amount of third, and he started mixing in some second base in Double-A and in the ORGANIZATION. He will get playing time at all three spots moving forward.PERSON's versatility should help him to get to the big leagues. At the very least, he could be a very valuable offensive-minded utilityman in the future.",1
"A former two-sport star at GPE (Calif.) High, PERSON was selected by the Brewers in the second round of the 2012 Draft and signed for $750,000. He made his full-season debut the following year and paced the ORGANIZATION State League with 36 doubles while stealing 22 bases as a 20-year-old in '14. The move up to Double-A proved a challenge for PERSON, and he regressed further in his return to the LOCATION in '16. He re-tooled his swing that offseason and looked like a different hitter in '17 when he returned from a hamstring injury in June. Advancing to Triple-A last season, PERSON put himself back on the big league radar with a breakout offensive performance that earned him a spot on PERSON's 40-man roster in November. PERSON is both athletic and toolsy, with an overall feel for the game that has long impressed evaluators given his multi-sport background. While he's always shown solid hitting ability thanks to a combination of bat speed and advanced bat-to-ball skills, leading to solid batting averages, PERSON had never hit double-digit home runs in a single season until 2018, when he delivered 20 bombs in his first Triple-A campaign. The significant uptick in power was a product of PERSON's revamped swing, as he attacked the ball at a better angle and hit the ball in the air more consistently than at any other point in his career. PERSON is an above-average runner but doesn't steal as many bases as he once did. His speed still serves him well across all three outfield spots, however, and he's long been praised by club officials for his instincts and range. And while PERSON has only average arm strength, his throws are very accurate and netted him 18 outfield assists in 2018.",0
"A fourth-round pick out of high school by the D-backs in 2012, PERSON spent parts of five seasons in the lower ORGANIZATION before finally reaching the Double-A level in 2016 during an injury-plagued campaign. The ORGANIZATION selected PERSON from GPE in the ORGANIZATION portion of the Rule 5 Draft in December and assigned him to Double-A, where he's put together his best and most complete offensive season to date in the ORGANIZATION while earning All-Star honors for the first time in his professional career at age 23.PERSON has shown feel to hit throughout his time in the ORGANIZATION. A switch-hitter, he has good bat speed and makes consistent contact from both sides of the plate, all while demonstrating good plate discipline as well as knowledge of the strike zone. His uptick in the power department this season has been a major development, though he'll likely always offer more pop to the gaps than true over-the-fence thump. And while he may not be a burner, PERSON does have average speed and earns praise for his baserunning ability.PERSON is best suited for left field defensively on account of his below-average arm strength, though he does have experience at all three outfield positions. That versatility along with his late-blooming bat could help him carve out a role as fifth outfielder at the highest level.",0
" Things have developed slowly for this GPE outfielder, spending two summers in the ORGANIZATION, then two more in the rookie-level PERSON. But after a 2012 campaign that saw him lead that league in home runs, finish tied for fifth in ORGANIZATION and end up seventh in slugging percentage, it looks like heâs starting to figure a few things out. PERSON has tremendous raw power and is just starting to learn how to tap into it. Heâs a solid runner, but isnât likely to be a major basestealing threat  as he matures. Heâs played all three outfield positions, but his plus arm and his power profile should fit very nicely in right field. Seeing what he can do in Ashevilleâs bandbox could be interesting in 2013.",0
" PERSON missed his junior season at GPE Carolina-Upstate due to a stress fracture in his back but still became the highest-drafted player in school history when the ORGANIZATION grabbed him in the fourth round of the 2014 Draft. Before his injury, PERSON had been slated to transition from the bullpen to the rotation, a move the ORGANIZATION intend to try themselves. As a reliever, he threw his fastball in the low to mid 90s, occasionally touching 96 mph. The steep downhill plane he throws from, thanks to his 6-foot-6 frame, helps compensate for his spotty command of the pitch.PERSON also throws a changeup and a solid low-80s slider with some bite, giving him a deep enough arsenal to start. To successfully make the move to the rotation, however, he'll have to do a better job of repeating his delivery and prove he's durable enough for the role.",0
"GPE's velocity is up a bit -- 90-94 last year, 92-96 this spring -- and he'll flash a plus breaking ball. He's small, but athletic, an indicaton he can hold the velo and also refine his command. 
",0
"Scouting Grades: Hit: 45 | Power: 30 | Run: 50 | Arm: 65 | Field: 50 | Overall: 45It hasn't been easy to see PERSON on the mound, as he didn't pitch as a freshman and worked just 22 1/3 innings the past two seasons as a part-time closer. In those brief looks, he has shown a swing-and-miss fastball that sits at 92-94 mph and tops out at 96. He's not a big guy, but he has a quick arm and a reasonably sound delivery.PERSON shows signs of a decent breaking ball and has the competitive edge to develop into a late-inning reliever. Like most two-way performers, he prefers playing everyday to pitching, so the team that drafts him may have to send him out as a second baseman and make him a full-time pitcher down the road.PERSON is a prospect as a second baseman, too, though his ceiling is more as a utilityman than as a regular. He handles the bat well, lacks pop and is an average runner, so he'll probably fit toward the bottom of a pro lineup. He has a strong arm and is a surehanded defender who made just two errors as a junior.",0
"A few years from now, the PERSON brothers could man both outfield corners for the ORGANIZATION. PERSON, a seventh-round pick in 2012, hit 13 homers as a rookie for PERSON last season. PERSON, who's 6 1/2 years younger, went fifth overall in the 2015 Draft and signed for $4 million. Arguably the best pure hitter among last year's high school prospects, PERSON makes consistent hard contact thanks to fast hands, a balanced left-handed swing and a mature approach. He also has plenty of raw power and could deliver 20 homers per season once he fills out his lanky 6-foot-4 frame.Compared to his brother, PERSON is a more well-rounded player and more advanced at the same stage of their careers. A center fielder at ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION High -- Hall of ORGANIZATION' alma mater -- he played there briefly during his pro debut but profiles best in right field. He has solid arm strength and speed, though he figures to lose a half-step once he matures physically.",1
"PERSON has always been blessed with tremendous raw tools, but has had trouble developing them, dealing both with injury and off-the-field issues. The 2012 season may prove to be the year the ORGANIZATION look back on as the time when the outfielder really started to put things together. He still only played in 65 games as he was delayed coming back from shoulder surgery, but he performed well in the ORGANIZATION State League and then kept going with a strong ORGANIZATION showing. PERSON has all the tools in the box, starting with plus speed that works on both sides of the ball. He has a very quick bat and can drive the ball to all fields, with more than enough future power, though he needs to continue to work on his selectivity. He can flat out play the outfield with a well above-average arm. He plays with an all-out style that's infectious. It's all about health at this point. If he can stay on the field, he has the chance to be an impact player.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",0
"The last time one of us wrote up PERSON he was a skinny, all-fields line drive tweener who looked like a classic bench outfielder. He has put on about 30 pounds since and has undergone a swing and approach change that has him lifting and pulling the ball more often. He's likely limited to left field due to mediocre arm strength, but he may profile as a low-end regular out there if the bat maxes out. Keep an eye on PERSON's walk rate. In 2018 it was a good bit better than his career mark. If that holds, he'll have a better chance of profiling than if it regresses to his career norms.",0
"PERSON signed out of the ORGANIZATION for $185,000, just the eighth-highest bonus the ORGANIZATION paid to sign an international player in 2013. He since has established himself as the best prospect from GPE's crop that year, skipping a level to make a strong GPE debut in the Rookie-level GPE League in 2015 and blowing away low Class A hitters this year. He joined the ORGANIZATION in November, going to GPE with fellow righty prospect PERSON in a trade for seven-time All-Star PERSON's fastball jumped from 87-91 mph when he turned pro to 93-97 mph two years later, peaking at 99. He backs up his heat with a pair of power breaking balls and a changeup with some fade. His slider is probably his best secondary pitch, though some scouts prefer his changeup.Though PERSON has the potential to become a frontline starter, he's a long way from getting there. He has a quick arm and not a lot of effort in his delivery, but he's still learning to repeat it. Though his control and command need polish, he has the upside to pitch in the front half of a big league rotation.",0
"PERSON's spot atop 2017 Draft boards was initially hurt by minor knee surgery the fall before his junior year and slightly lackluster stuff as a result at the start of his season. He did finish strongly and dominated in the ORGANIZATION World Series shortly after the ORGANIZATION feel he dropped in their lap at ORGANIZATION. 18 overall in the June Draft. He didn't pitch after signing as PERSON erred on the side of caution.By the end of his final season with GPE, PERSON was back to full strength, featuring his plus fastball and one of the best sliders in the class. He'll sit around 93 mph and touch 95 regularly with good sink. He threw his slider too much in college, but it is a true out pitch that gets a lot of swings and misses. He'll flash a very good changeup, something he'll have to throw more often as a pro. He generally throws strikes, though it's more control than command right now.Even though the ORGANIZATION went slightly over pick value to sign PERSON, he could prove to be a first-round bargain, a top-of-the-Draft talent found in the middle of the round. His Gators teammate A.J. PERSON made it to Double-A in his first full season of pro ball, and PERSON's stuff allowed him to follow a similar fast track.",0
"The stringy PERSON has arguably the most copious physical projection in the class and some scouts think his frame has room to add about 30 pounds while still retaining the range and flexibility for shortstop. PERSON's endless limbs spear down and corral ground balls and he has shocking body control for an athlete his age with his build. PERSON isn't strong with the bat just yet but his swing has some natural loft from both sides of the plate and if his body matures in the ORGANIZATION Zone that allows him to stay at short and do damage with the stick, he could be a star.",0
"Relatively projectable, ORGANIZATION sits in the 89-92 range with curveball feel and could develop enough of a changeup and control to pitch at the back of a rotation.",0
"On a ORGANIZATION staff loaded with hard-throwing right-handers, no one throws harder than PERSON. He usually deals at 92-95 mph, tickles the upper 90s and has peaked at 99.PERSON's fastball lacks life and command, however, so it gets hit more than its velocity suggests it should. As a result, the ORGANIZATION have used him mostly as a set-up man, which is also his likely ceiling as a pro.PERSON's second pitch is a hard curveball with 11-to-5 break. He's not especially tall, so he needs to stay on top of his pitches with his overhand delivery to achieve some downhill plane. Otherwise, his stuff becomes vulnerable when he leaves it up in the strike zone.",0
"PERSON had as high a ceiling as any prep pitcher in the 2015 Draft, though an inconsistent senior season mitigated his at-times spectacular showcase performance from the previous summer and dropped him to the 27th overall pick. After signing for $2.3 million, he walked 32 batters and recorded an 11.72 ERA in 17 2/3 innings at ORGANIZATION. He returned there last summer and while he wasn't as overmatched, he still struggled to find the strike zone and display the stuff that made him a first-rounder.When PERSON can keep his delivery together, he can sit in the low 90s with sink on his two-seam fastball, reach 97 mph with his four-seamer, spin a hammer curveball in the low 80s and flash a plus changeup. But he has trouble repeating his mechanics and sometimes pitches tentatively, resulting in heaters sitting around 90 mph and diminished secondary stuff.If PERSON can repeat his delivery, maintain a consistent arm slot and recapture the arsenal he has shown in the past, he still could become a frontline starter. The ORGANIZATION saw positive signs during instructional league and early in GPE Training, which offers hope that he'll figure it out, as do his youth and the athleticism that made him an all-conference quarterback in high school. But he injured his elbow and had PERSON surgery in mid-April, so he won't be able to make any progress until he returns to the mound in 2018.",0
"Most conversations about PERSON begin with his bat, and for good reason. He has the chance to hit his way to the big leagues.PERSON has already shown the ability to hit for average from the left side of the plate, with an advanced approach and a smooth left-handed swing. There's more power to come, and it should be noted that PERSON had the same amount of home runs with PERSON that PERSON hit there, and PERSON did it in fewer games. While he will never be known for his glovework, the ORGANIZATION feel PERSON has gotten a bad rap for his defense and that he is more than just a bat being hidden in left field.That said, PERSON's ability to swing the bat is his calling card, and he has the chance to develop into a run producer at the highest level.",1
"When the ORGANIZATION selected him in the second round in the 2014 Draft, PERSON joined a group of six other GPE high school pitchers taken in the top three rounds over the past decade, highlighted by 2007 first-rounder PERSON Porcello.PERSON was the first player drafted from GPE Augustine Prep, and it was undoubtedly his size, arm strength and projection that drew the ORGANIZATION' interest. The right-hander sits at 90-92 mph and touches 94, something that should become a more consistent reading when he fills out his big frame. PERSON's heater has run and sink, and he does a nice job of using his height to throw it on a steep downward plane.PERSON has a power curve that can be inconsistent, but it has plenty of depth when it's on. His changeup and overall command are works in progress, but the end result could be an outstanding starting pitcher at the highest level.",0
"Lefties who can touch triple digits don't exactly grow on trees. That's a big reason why the ORGANIZATION gave PERSON a $650,000 bonus -- more than $400,000 above the recommended slot value -- out of PERSON in the sixth round of the 2014 Draft. He began his first full season at ORGANIZATION A Short PERSON before moving up to ORGANIZATION A Delmarva, and he showcased big bat-missing potential at both stops by combining to strike out 60 batters in just 42 1/3 innings. Though his control regressed considerably this season in the ORGANIZATION A Advanced PERSON, PERSON's electric arm and knock for piling up strikeouts netted him a promotion to Double-A Bowie in late July. PERSON's velocity is the big southpaw's lone calling card right now. He's hit 100 miles per hour in the past and was consistently 96-99 mph in the ORGANIZATION. The rest of PERSON's game is very much a work in progress. The ORGANIZATION are working with him to develop a consistent delivery so he can learn to throw his plus heater for strikes. He doesn't really have any secondary pitches he can count on, though he did show improved confidence in his slider in the ORGANIZATION League.A broken finger suffered when he punched a wall during the offseason kept PERSON from throwing during Spring Training. While he faces a long road ahead of him from a developmental perspective, PERSON's handedness and elite heater give him significant upside as late-inning reliever.",1
"Sometimes taking a shot with a late-round pick can pay off. PERSON was a primarily a third baseman at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, with an elbow injury that kept him largely off the mound as planned during his junior year. The ORGANIZATION rolled the dice in the 30th round and it turned out he needed PERSON surgery. Even with that setback, the right-hander was ready for the upper levels of the system.The son of former big leaguer PERSON, PERSON has used his power sinker to excellent effect in what was his first full season in 2015. As a starter, PERSON will throw his fastball in the low-90s, though he can reach back for more, getting a ton of ground-ball outs. He'll throw his changeup with some good fade and it should be a Major League average pitch, while his 77-mph breaking ball is slurvy at times, leaving some to believe he might be a good candidate for a cutter or a true slider.PERSON looked very strong out of the pen in 2015 and his stuff might tick up in shorter stints. It might be too soon to pull the plug on developing him as a starter, but he could move more quickly as a ground-ball inducing setup man.",0
"GSP is a good pitchability righty with solid average stuff and huge, groundball-heavy performance in A-Ball.",0
"GPE's Friday starter has the ideal pitcher's build, strong and durable, with the potential to throw four pitches from it.Thurman's fastball could be a plus pitch in the future -- he can reach back for a mid-90s heater when he needs to. He throws a curve and a slider, with the former a bit better than the latter, and his changeup is a deceptive offspeed offering. His good command lets his stuff play up and he can move his fastball in and out, going right after hitters with a very strong feel for pitching.The combination of stuff, size, and pitchability could make Thurman a future middle-of-the-rotation type at the highest level.",0
"PERSON and his above average bat speed already pack quite a punch and, while his bat isn't in the hitting zone very long, he's shown good timing in games and scouts are optimistic about him hitting and hitting for some power. Though he'll likely be signed as a shortstop, scouts project PERSON to the outfield due to his fringe hands and athleticism.",0
"PERSON's numbers aren't very good at Double-A this year but he's a teen in the upper levels with an eltie strikeout rate, which is very encouraging as far as his offensive future is concerned. He's not especially athletic but has great baseball feel and the game appears to move slowly for him. He projects as an averyday catcher with a unique statistical profile.",0
"Some scouts are put off by PERSON's buggy whip swing but he showed great feel to hit in high school and during his first pro summer, so most think he'll be able to tap into what projects as plus raw power. PERSON had PERSON last March and didn't play in 2017. Assuming a full arm strength recovery, he projects in right field.",0
"Teams that put a lot of stock into PERSON performances are likely to have an interest in this ORGANIZATION infielder.PERSON hit over .300 after both his freshman and sophomore years at ORGANIZATION, helping to erase a subpar second college season. He has a quick bat and an ability to hit to all fields. And he has a solid approach at the plate with good plate discipline. While PERSON has shown good extra-base pop, there is some question over how much over-the-fence power he'll have in the future. While he has the actions, hands and arms to be a solid third baseman, he could end up at second base if a team doesn't think he'll have the power profile needed to man the hot corner.ORGANIZATION hitters have had a checkered track record at the next level, a bias PERSON might have to overcome. But his history of success, especially on the GPE, should help overcome that.",0
"PERSON signed for the fifth highest bonus in the 2017 July 2nd class, among a few already-elite prospects like ORGANIZATION of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON shortstop PERSON, PERSON outfielder PERSON and ORGANIZATION shortstop PERSON. PERSON could be next in line to jump into the 50 FV tier during the 2019 season, building on a solid pro debut in 2018, where he improved his already-impressive tool profile. To clarify any confusion, it's worth noting that there is another, very similar middle infield prospect with the ORGANIZATION the same name who was also born in the same year. The ORGANIZATION' PERSON has an above average hit tool to go with above average speed, defense, and arm strength at shortstop, so it won't be a long journey to turn into a regular if he can maintain those current tools. He's played just 43 official minor league games and has an unsustainably-high .418 ORGANIZATION, but the performance also supports the standout skillset. Some scouts argue there isn't a plus tool here other than arm strength, so you can't stuff PERSON too high until he's done a little more in official games, but he's already among the top 200 prospects or so in baseball. Some see sneaky potential average raw power down the road, which PERSON could mostly get to in games if he ends up being the plus hitter that some are projecting, though some scouts see 45 hit and 40 power, given the limited pro looks they've had. It's also worth noting that PERSON has become close friends with PERSON; the pair could team up to form half of the infield of the future in GSP. PERSON will definitely be one to watch closely in 2019 as there's some in-season ceiling to his potential ranking, particularly if he can perform the way the ORGANIZATION' PERSON did this past year; that PERSON reached High-A at age 18.",0
"Woods-Richardson broke out on the showcase circuit last summer, running his fastball up to 95 mph at the ORGANIZATION Games and showing three-pitch potential at multiple events. He looked like a potential top-three-rounds pick, but hasn't built on that momentum this spring. Pro teams are still interested, though now they're wondering if he might be destined to become a reliever and if he can be picked early enough to sign him away from a GPE commitment.Though Woods-Richardson's arm speed and athleticism still endear him to scouts, he has spent much of his senior year pitching at 89-92 mph with a fastball that features more angle than life. A midseason tonsillectomy didn't help, but he also has a history of inconsistency with his stuff. His curveball hasn't been as sharp as hoped either, and he hasn't used his changeup much after it looked promising last summer.Woods-Richardson has a sound delivery with a high-three-quarters arm slot and repeats it well. But unless he shows he can carry his best stuff deeper into ballgames, he may wind up in the bullpen. He's also a talented third baseman with power and arm strength, giving him a chance to contribute as a two-way player if he joins the ORGANIZATION.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 21, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON, a star at ORGANIZATION, may have earned a 2016 Perfect Game Underclass Honorable Mention, but the biggest achievement of his young career was leading his GPE to an appearance in the ORGANIZATION state finals as a sophomore pitcher and shortstop.After receiving interest from top programs like ORGANIZATION State PERSON and ORGANIZATION, GPE committed to play for ORGANIZATION-Lafayette.A versatile player, GPE showcases skills from both sides of the plate. He displays good bat control and a smooth swing with line-drive power to the gaps as both a left-handed and right-handed hitter.",0
"As a ninth-round senior who signed for $5,000 out of ORGANIZATION State in 2013, PERSON doesn't have the strongest prospect pedigree. However, the left-hander jumped on the fast track to the ORGANIZATION last season, turning in dominant showings at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Dunedin and Double-A New Hampshire before finishing the year with a taste of Triple-A. Added to the ORGANIZATION' 40-man roster during the offseason, PERSON reached the big leagues for the first time in late April. PERSON was over-the-top in college but has since lowered his arm slot considerably, giving his 87-89 mph fastball a lot of sink while enabling him to work down in the zone consistently. He complements it with a short, wipeout slider at 79-80 mph that is lethal against left-handed hitters, evidenced by their collective .096/.143/.123 and 29 strikeouts in 77 plate appearances against him in 2015. However, his below-average changeup limits his success against righties.Though he's bounced between Triple-A and the big leagues this season, PERSON's track record as a situational lefty should get him carve out a role in a big league bullpen sooner rather than later.",0
"Coming out of GPE (Okla.) High in 2013, PERSON could have gone in the top three rounds had he been considered signable. Instead, he lasted until the ORGANIZATION took him in the 32nd round and headed to PERSON. After he missed all of 2015 with a sprained ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow that didn't require surgery, he has worked his way back into the first three rounds during a spring in which he threw three consecutive shutouts and won Big 12 Conference pitcher of the year honors.The Cowboys have dropped PERSON's arm slot to low three-quarters, adding more life to his stuff. The redshirt sophomore can sit at 91-94 mph with his fastball deep into games and top out at 96. He doesn't miss a ton of bats but the running and sinking life on his heater generates a lot of groundouts.PERSON's new arm slot lends itself well to a slider, and his low-80s breaking ball is a plus pitch at times and he can throw it to both sides of the plate. He has feel for a changeup and for commanding his pitches, so it's easy to project him as a starter at the next level.",0
"GPE and his brother defected from GPE at age 13 in 2016, after their team had won the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION Republic -- an event in which PERSON was named ORGANIZATION. Very few Major League clubs were able to watch him after that, as the ORGANIZATION sheltered him from open scouting opportunities so as to ensure they would be able to sign him once eligible. PERSON's plan came to fruition in July 2019, when they inked GPE for $2.85 million, one of the largest bonuses given to a player in the class. According to scouts who've seen him, GPE' carrying tool is his right-handed power, and he's already physically advanced for his age, listed at 6-foot-3, 200 pounds. He's said to have some feel to hit, too. On defense, scouts have pegged GPE as a future corner outfielder -- likely left field, since his arm strength is said to be average. He's an average runner, but could lose as step with physical development. A ton isn't yet known about GPE simply because the ORGANIZATION essentially had him quarantined for the last several years. But given the club's sizable investment in him, which accounted for more than half of their entire $5.4 million bonus pool for the 2019-20 international period, it's clear that they believe they have a potentially special player in GPE, who should get his taste of pro ball during fall instructional league.",0
" When you hit 30 homers in your first full season, it's nearly impossible to duplicate that effort for an encore in year two. Yet PERSON certainly didn't disappoint, reaching Triple-A by the end of the season, then slugging nearly .800 in the playoffs to help PERSON win the ORGANIZATION title. While his power numbers were down, PERSON did show an ability to make adjustments after struggling initially with the move to Double-A, hitting close to .300 by season's end with plenty of extra-base pop. With a plus arm and solid defensive skills, he still profiles very nicely as a right fielder who's not far from being ready.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",0
"PERSON started at quarterback at FACILITY (ORGANIZATION) as a freshman, and his athleticism and arm strength made him a promising college football prospect. He gave up the gridiron as a sophomore, however, and has blossomed into one of the toolsier high school players available in the 2017 Draft. He has eased some worries about his bat with a strong spring, and a club that fully believes in his hitting ability could pluck him in the first round.PERSON's bat speed, strength and leverage give him some of the best raw power in this year's high school crop. His right-handed swing has some arm bar and got out of sync on the showcase circuit, but he has done a nice job of quieting and repeating his stroke as a senior. He's doing a better job of using the entire field and scouts feel better about his chances of tapping into his considerable pop.A solid runner who covers ground with long strides, PERSON may lose a half-step as he fills out. That would prompt a move from center field to right, where his cannon arm would fit perfectly. He's a 19-year-old high schooler, which some teams see as a red flag and would make him Draft-eligible after two years at ORGANIZATION State if he attends college.",0
"A fifth rounder from a small, ORGANIZATION school in GPE, PERSON has a fastball with traits teams covet with increasing frequency. He only sits 89-93 and tops at 95, but his arm angle and ability to really backspin the fastball creates big life on the pitch, enabling him to beat hitters at the top of the zone. PERSON's curveball has good complimentary movement and some depth, but it lacks power and only competes for whiffs beneath the zone. He's striking out a lot of hitters (29% on the year) and was promoted to Hi-A before the trade, which is fine for a 22-year-old but impressive for someone who came out of such a small program just last year. it's a fastball-heavy profile right now, but that's a good starting point.",0
"A part-time starter as an GPE freshman in 2017, PERSON exploded as a sophomore. He batted .406/.462/.671 to win ORGANIZATION player of the year honors, set school and league records with a 32-game hitting streak and continued to rake in the ORGANIZATION. He has posted strong numbers again this spring despite missing some time with back issues.PERSON is one of the most polished hitters in the college ranks. He has fine hand-eye coordination and a disciplined, balanced approach that allow him to make repeated contact to all fields. He has quickness in his left-handed stroke and strength and leverage in his 6-foot-3 frame, giving him solid raw power that he taps into without selling out for home runs.Most of PERSON's value will come from his bat, but that could be considerable value as he has the upside of a .280 hitter with 20 homers on an annual basis. Though he's a below-average athlete with speed and arm strength to match, he can play an adequate left field when he's fully healthy. He had to DH at times this spring when his back flared up.",0
"GPE is the prototype. His size, physical composition and athleticism are ideal, as is his golden arm which produces upper-90s heat like it's nothing. His breaking stuff has been better this year than it was when he wsa in high school and you can go nuts projecting on his changeup and command because of his athleticism. He's a potential front-end starter.",0
"  The GPE had two first-round picks in the 2014 Draft, and 10 picks after taking PERSON, they selected ORGANIZATION. He pitched well in his professional debut and was a part of the team that won the ORGANIZATION championship. During the offseason he was arrested in his hometown and pleaded guilty to underage drinking and aggravated criminal trespass. ORGANIZATION received probation, and the case could be expunged from his record in a year, but the incident was surprising, as scouts had lauded his makeup before the draft. On the mound, ORGANIZATION has a solid three-pitch mix. His fastball sits in the low 90s and has been clocked up to 96 mph. He has a good feel for his curveball and changeup, both of which are advanced for a teenager. He's a good athlete with a clean delivery, allowing him to throw strikes with all his pitches. At 5-foot-10, ORGANIZATION is slightly undersized but still has all the tools necessary to develop into a solid starting pitcher.",1
"PERSON was among the top GPE high school pitchers in this year's PERSON class and the GPE made him their fifth-round selection in June. He is polished for a high schooler and has the potential for three Major League-average pitches. PERSON's fastball sits in the upper-80s to low-90s. He mixes it with a curveball and changeup, both of which are promising. He has a clean delivery and has a good feel for his whole arsenal. PERSON's advanced stuff and understanding of pitching help make up for his lack of projection. He could move faster than most high school pitchers and profiles as a middle-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"The son of former ORGANIZATION infielder PERSON Sr., the teenage infielder grew up around the game, and it shows.PERSON like PERSON's swing, his strong arm and his fluid actions on defense. He's shown decent arm strength and raw power to his pull side. PERSON's knack for barreling up balls and his repeatable swing have also impressed evaluators.Some believe PERSON can play multiple positions and could end up at second or third base or even in the outfield. His big frame will allow him to build strength. PERSON also like his makeup and how he handles himself on and off the field. He has a game-oriented mindset, and his makeup is off the charts.PERSON signed a $700,000 deal with the FACILITY.",1
"Outside of PERSON, PERSON threw consistently harder than any other pitcher on the high school showcase circuit during the summer. He came out averaging 94 mph and peaking at 96 mph at the ORGANIZATION in June and was still firing 94-95 mph bullets at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship four months later. He has shown the same velocity this spring.PERSON lacks prototypical size at 6-foot-1, but he generates his velocity with a quick arm and works down in the strike zone thanks to his high three-quarters arm slot. His delivery also helps him stay on top of his power curveball, which can be a plus pitch. His changeup has its moments as well.Though PERSON doesn't have much physical projection remaining, he already has enough stuff and just needs more consistency. He's committed to PERSON A&M, as has PERSON, one of the other top right-handers in the 2015 high school class.",0
"Three-pitch lefty with cross-bodied delivery. Below-average control. PERSON touch 96 with tail, his shapely slurve is average, flashing above, he has some nascent changeup feel for a pitch that has drop and fade at 84-88mph. PERSON's arm is very fast, his delivery is athletic and funky. He has relief risk because of the command, but the pitch mix is strong.",0
" Another aggressive Latin GPE signing, the Aâs gave PERSON $2.2 million in 2010. He played in the ORGANIZATION in 2011 and then impressed in the ORGANIZATION in 2012, finishing among the league leaders in a host of offensive categories, from batting average to ORGANIZATION and ORGANIZATION. Heâs a long way from GPE, but he shows signs of hitting for both power and average, with a decent approach at the plate and excellent bat speed. Itâs unclear just yet if heâll be able to stay at third, with his below-average speed limiting his range. If he hits like it appears he can, heâll be just fine if he has to move to first base in the future.",1
"A two-sport speedster who has begun to grow into his body over the last several months, PERSON has moved toward the front of a crowded high school outfield class in the 20-40 overall range as he's a bit more game-ready than the other speedy, tooled-up outfielders in that range (PERSON, GPE, G. Mitchell) and more ilkely to stay in CF than the ones scouts think will hit (ORGANIZATION, GPE, GPE). He'll be 19 on draft day and is a bit raw for a prep bat of that age but the multi-sport pedigree explains some of that away.",0
"  PERSON helped PERSON State reach the ORGANIZATION and was named the school's PERSON Student-Athlete of the Year as a junior. The ORGANIZATION drafted him in the sixth round, and he has had a strong first full pro season in Class A.Lean and athletic, PERSON has all the makings of a top-of-the-order catalyst. He has above-average speed and a good eye at the plate, repeatedly making contact using his quickness to get on base. He has minimal power, instead employing a slashing approach from both sides of the plate.PERSON also makes good use of his speed on defense. He has good instincts, allowing him to get good jumps and cover a lot of ground in center field.",1
"Undrafted out of ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION, GPE), PERSON spent two years pitching for the ORGANIZATION in the independent Frontier League before inking a deal with the Marlins in July 2016. He's since climbed quickly through the Minors, opening his first full professional campaign with PERSON, where he was a ORGANIZATION State PERSON, and reaching Double-A roughly a year after signing.PERSON may pitch with a tick below average velocity, but his fastball plays up because he creates a good downhill angle to the plate with a deceptive delivery. His changeup is above average, features good velocity separation and is effective against hitters on both sides of the plate. A fringy curveball gives PERSON a third pitch that club officials say has improved in his first full season.PERSON gets the most out of his three-pitch mix because he's a consistent strike-thrower who has feel for changing speeds and keeping hitters off balance. And while his stuff may not be overpowering, it hasn't stopped the right-hander from piling up his share of whiffs early in his pro career. He profiles as a back-of-the-rotation starter or a long reliever.",0
"Lots of GPE prospects are two-year ORGANIZATION guys by virtue of the fact that the GPE have no AZL team, but PERSON is so physically immature that he'd probably be of that ilk anyway. He does have some feel to hit from both sides of the plate and his swing has some natural lift when he's swinging left-handed, but he'd have to get much stronger for that to matter at all. He has plus hands and infield footwork and will likely grow into enough arm strength for the left side. It'll likely be a long time before he's anything at all, and he may end up as a utility infielder at best, but switch-hitting middle infield fits typically find big league roles.",0
"  The 2013 season amounted to a lost one for PERSON. He struggled in his first introduction to full-season ball and then was sidelined for the final two months by a broken wrist. He suffered another setback during the offseason when he ruptured his GPE tendon, an injury that kept him out for the first six weeks of 2014. PERSON bounced back when he returned and was performing well in Double-A when he suffered a tear in his hip flexor in June. When healthy, PERSON shows an exciting combination of athleticism and tools. The switch-hitter has more extra-base pop than his size suggests, but his game will always be about using his speed to get on base and make things happen. His speed also helps him defensively, as he moved from shortstop to center field in 2014. He's still learning his new position but could become an above-average defender once he gets more experience in the outfield.PERSON had good momentum going before his latest injury. Expected to recover fully, look for the speedster to run his way to GSP soon.",1
"PERSON wasn't able to turn a big Cape PERSON season in the summer of 2016 into his junior year at ORGANIZATION, resulting in him sliding to the fourth round of the 2017 Draft. When he hit .320 with an .877 OPS in his pro debut, reaching full-season ball, it looked like the ORGANIZATION had a steal on their hands. He wasn't able to build off the very strong foundation of that pro debut in 2018 when he blew out his right ACL six games into the season.Once again healthy, PERSON can get back to being the on-base machine who can wreak havoc on the basepaths. It remains to be seen if the injury will have any toll on his well above-average speed, but the ORGANIZATION don't expect any regression and he was running without hesitation this spring. That should allow him to steal bases and continue to cover a ton of ground in center field, with great instincts, reads and routes as well. PERSON knows who he is as a hitter, sending line drives to all fields from the left side of the plate, working counts and getting on base, albeit without much power.The outfielder shouldn't have any restrictions going forward following his knee injury, though he'll have to show no ill effects, given how important his legs are to his game. If there are no setbacks, he should be able to return to climbing the organizational ladder quickly.",0
"Though he has battled for the national high school lead in home runs all spring, PERSON has been more impressive on the mound and thrust himself into first-round consideration as a pitcher. He set a national prep record by striking out 24 consecutive hitters over two games in GPE, including the first 18 batters in a contest in which he finished with 21 whiffs over eight innings.PERSON's fastball sat around 86-87 mph on the showcase circuit last summer, and he looked like a projectable left-hander who'd be best off attending college at GPE. That outlook has changed since he added significant strength during the offseason, giving him a heater that now sits in the low 90s and climbs as high as 95 mph. His fastball features some sink and tail, and he uses his 6-foot-5 frame to create angle and plane that are difficult for hitters to handle.PERSON's curveball is inconsistent because his delivery can get a bit methodical, but it should give him a solid second offering. He also shows feel for a changeup with some fade and tumble that he'll need to use more at the next level. A quality athlete who already has a big league build -- ""If there's a better body in the GPE,"" one crosschecker said, ""I'd like to see it"" -- he repeats his delivery well and throws strikes.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 4, 2017 - PERSON, Calif.Favorite ORGANIZATION Team: GPE ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION Player: PERSON, a 6-foot-4 outfielder from GPE, has committed to play for ORGANIZATION. He was a 2015 ORGANIZATION and made the 2016 Underclass 1st Team. Thanks to his impressive play at ORGANIZATION, he was also able to showcase his skills at the ORGANIZATION Games.Ward's father, GPE, played football for PERSON and some scouts have said that Je'Von inherited his quickness. The outfielder took part in ORGANIZATION's FACILITY and honed his skills at ORGANIZATION's Breakthrough Series camp as well, where he was mentored by former ORGANIZATION star PERSON.",0
"PERSON backed up his breakout 2017 campaign with a .313/.368/.430 2018 season line, mostly at Double-A. His swing is compact and rhythmic, and he's very difficult to beat with velocity because he can time just about everything. This, combined with an ability to guide the barrel around the zone, drives a promising, contact-first offensive package that would be quite valuable at catcher. PERSON moved from shortstop (in high school) to third base (as a college freshman) to catcher (as a sophomore) and has been behind the plate for four seasons now. He remains below-average in most aspects of catching, but isn't so bad that he'll surely have to move. He's not nearly as skilled a defender as PERSON, but PERSON has a much better chance to make an offensive impact. Yadier GPE is signed through 2020, which creates the illusion of a catching logjam, but he's somewhat fragile and PERSON and PERSON's experience at corner infield spots (PERSON has played some first base as a pro, but did not in 2018) could enable the Cardinals to carry all three of them at some point. If tasked with everyday duty, we think PERSON would produce like an average everyday player.",1
"Signed out of GPE for $220,000 in 2012, PERSON blew past expectations in '14 by not only reaching full-season ball, but pitching exceptionally well there. He continued his strong pitching in the ORGANIZATION State League last season and shined in an impressive spot start for Triple-A Rochester in May. The ORGANIZATION took notice of the right-hander's development and acquired him from GPE as part of the ORGANIZATION deal at the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's advanced feel for pitching was on display last season as he excelled against older hitters at age 21. The right-hander has been even better this year at ORGANIZATION, earning LOCATION All-Star honors while once again making a Triple-A spot start.PERSON's fastball will be plus at times but typically sits in the low 90s with good life, while his changeup and palmball both project to be at least average. PERSON also has a usable curveball, but it's taken a back seat to his slider, which flashes above-average potential despite being relatively new to his arsenal.The biggest knock on PERSON is that, at 6-foot-1, 230 pounds, he lacks physical projection. However, the right-hander's stuff and command are good enough for him to develop into a back-of-the-rotation starter in the big leagues.",1
"Signed for $400,000 by the ORGANIZATION out of the ORGANIZATION in 2012, PERSON made quite an impression in his professional debut the following summer as he led the ORGANIZATION in batting average (,348) and ORGANIZATION (1.023). He continued his success as he made his GPE debut in 2014, reaching Class A LOCATION as an 18-year-old. After the season, the D-backs acquired him in the three-team trade that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON has an advanced approach for such a young player, showing deft control of the strike zone and the ability to hit line drives all over the field. As a bonus, he's a switch-hitter, and he has the potential to produce double-figure home run power once he adds strength. An average runner, PERSON fits best at second base but has also played shortstop in the ORGANIZATION. He has good defensive instincts and reliable hands to go with average arm strength and range.",1
"The origin of PERSON's superficially surprising 40-man add was the glacial pace at which the ORGANIZATION moved him through the system during his first several seasons. He spent four years at various levels of rookie ball and barely pitched, only throwing about 40 affiliated innings per year on average. The 38 innings he threw at Low-A to round out 2018 were dominant, as PERSON recorded 68 strikeouts, most of which were accrued with either of his two excellent breaking balls, which he has better feel for locating than he does his mid-90s fastball. 
There's considerable industry doubt regarding PERSON's ability to start, the result of several factors. The lack of total innings creates reasonable doubt about him handling a 140-plus inning workload, and the lack of fastball command, along with PERSON's mediocre changeup, are also cited as pitfalls. As long as PERSON's breaking ball command refines though, he may have the tools to attack lefties and get ahead of hitters even if these other components are sub-optimal. His 40-man addition makes it more likely that he spends the early part of his big league career in the bullpen, but he may be a dominant multi-inning piece and could evetually transition into the rotation. Despite some clear present issues, we're betting heavily on the stuff here.",1
"The top catcher in the 2013 GPE class, ORGANIZATION was ranked ORGANIZATION. 10 on MLB.com's PERSON 100 at the time of the GPE. Many thought the ORGANIZATION were eyeing him for their first pick, at ORGANIZATION. 9, so they were no doubt thrilled when he was available at ORGANIZATION. 14. The left-handed hitting catcher is the complete package. ORGANIZATION is strong-bodied with some projection to his frame, which could lead to more power to go along with a very solid hit tool. Behind the plate, ORGANIZATION has a plus arm and a very quick exchange, leaving no doubt about his ability to stay behind the plate. He gets high marks for his all-out effort and should be a leader behind the plate for the ORGANIZATION.",1
"PERSON wasn't seen much over the summer, then exploded this spring, showing improved defensive abilty, more bat speed and huge raw power in front of massive crowds of scouts.",0
" The ORGANIZATION went over slot to sign PERSON away from the ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION in 2010, and they liked his stuff and pitchability enough to send the ORGANIZATION high school product to full-season ball in his first full professional season. He rebounded from a disappointing 2012 to reach Double-A in 2013 and lead all ORGANIZATION PERSON with 160 strikeouts. He was then dealt to GPE in December as part of the ORGANIZATION' package for PERSON. While PERSON doesn't have the highest ceiling, he projects as a pitchability lefty who can make a living in the back of a big league rotation. He still needs to tighten his command but projects to have average control in the future. His average fastball has good sink to it, and he'll show an average sinking changeup and slider that has occasional bite.",1
" GPE ORGANIZATION's streak of having high school pitchers in the top two rounds ended at four years this June, but the ORGANIZATION State still had a prep arm of note, with PERSON going in the fourth round and getting a bonus slightly larger than pick value to sign.PERSON doesn't tower over hitters or light up radar guns, but his athleticism and three-pitch are intriguing. He'll show a low-90s fastball that can reach 93 mph early in games, though he drops more into the upper 80s in the later innings. He's athletic and has a slender 6-foot-2 frame, so he should throw harder and maintain his velocity better once he adds strength. While his secondary pitches lack consistency, he has depth on his 73-78 mph curveball and sells his fading changeup well. PERSON has a quick arm and throws strikes, though he needs to fine-tune his command, something that should come with pro instruction.",0
"PERSON has prototypical size and arm strength but is almost exactly the same player we wrote up last offseason. He still has issues locating his heater and with his breaking ball's consistency, though it flashes plus. Because he has two unteachable skills in his elite velocity and ability to spin, PERSON has significant upside if he improves the remaining aspects of his craft. He's not likely to fully actualize, but it is possible. There's a greater chance that some things improve and enable PERSON to be a No. 4 or 5 starter or late-inning reliever. ",0
"It's easy to dream on PERSON, who has a big league body and an impressive set of tools highlighted by well above-average raw power. Multiple scouts have compared him to a young PERSON Holliday, though PERSON also comes with concerns about his vision and his hitting ability.PERSON has the strength and leverage to hit tape-measure home runs. But he also has holes in his right-handed stroke, swings and misses too frequently and doesn't seem to recognize or track pitches well. There are questions about how well he sees the ball, though he submitted a vision test that gave him a clean bill of health to the ORGANIZATION Scouting Bureau.If PERSON can make consistent contact, he could be a star. He has plus straight-line speed and likely will move from center field in high school to right field in pro ball. The ORGANIZATION State recruit has an average, accurate arm.",0
"PERSON was part of the ORGANIZATION' 2016 pool-busting haul of players who later became free agents due to the sanctions levied against GPE. PERSON got a $1 million bonus the first time around, then another $850,000 from GPE, signing along with fellow former-Brave and PERSON. It's a cliche in scouting to call a player a 'Venezuelan-style shortstop,' but PERSON fits that to a T: smaller, without big tools, but with an advanced feel to play, and a gritty, high-effort style. He had about 30-grade raw power when he signed, and his exit velos were topping out in the mid-90s in the ORGANIZATION for GPE, but he's now hitting a quarter of his balls in play in the 90s and looks like he'll be able to avoid being so weak that pitchers can knock the bat out of his hands. PERSON is a roughly average runner with a roughly average arm, but both tools play up due to his instincts and strong internal clock, so he's a potential above average shortstop. He also has advanced feel to hit, with above average bat control and a self-aware approach at the plate. There's a road to a Jose Iglesias-type regular here, but it's more likely PERSON lands in the utility range, with maybe a season or two where he's starting quality.",0
"PERSON spent the first two years of his college career at FACILITY, where he got just 31 at-bats and 29 innings, before transferring to LOCATION. He went undrafted as a junior, when he doubled as the ORGANIZATION' first baseman and closer, but could be the first senior picked in 2015.Though PERSON ranked among the ORGANIZATION II leaders with 17 homers and an .827 slugging percentage entering regional tournament play, he'll get selected as a pitcher. After topping out at 95 mph with his fastball a year ago, he's now working at 93-95 mph and reaching 97. His 82-86 slider gives him a second plus pitch at times, though it can get slurvy.PERSON has a physical, durable frame that allows him to maintain his velocity even when he pitches on consecutive days. He has a decent delivery that he repeats well, allowing him to throw strikes. He'll probably be a late-inning reliever in pro ball, though he flashes an average changeup in bullpen sessions and could get a look as a starter.",0
"  A three-sport star in high school, PERSON climbed ORGANIZATION boards in the spring of 2014, thanks to his athleticism, arm strength and projectability. The ORGANIZATION grabbed him with their second pick of the ORGANIZATION and signed him away from his GPE commitment. PERSON typically throws his fastball in the low 90s and is capable of touching higher velocities. Those readings may become more common as he fills out his large frame. His power curveball is his best secondary offering, while he's working to improve his changeup. He mostly pitches around the strike zone and worked to improve his overall command after signing. While he still needs some polish, PERSON has all the physical tools necessary to become a solid starting pitcher.",0
"A growth spurt bouyed PERSON's tools and draft stock, as he's this year's most prominent pop-up high school prospect. He may have the best frame in the entire draft but has already grown into considerable power, which he gets to in games despite an awkwardly-timed stride. At times clumsy on defense, PERSON may still be growing into his new body. He may end up at second or third base (where he played as an amateur) or get a try in center field if his hands and actions don't improve. He's one of the draft's higher risk, higher reward prospects.",0
" Many consider PERSON the best pitcher on the international market this year, and it's easy to see why he has garnered so much attention. Scouts like his tall and lean body, along with his loose and easy arm actions on the mound. PERSON's fastball hovers in the 88 to 92 mph range, but his changeup might be his best overall pitch, and he can throw it in any count. PERSON's curveball has good rotation with bite, and he uses it in the strike zone early in counts and as a strikeout pitch.Scouts like PERSON's command of all of his pitches and his overall feel for pitching. Some scouts believe he can look disinterested at times, and his delivery could use some work, but there is no denying his potential.PERSON is based in GPE, GPE, and is trained by PERSON FaÃ±a. The ORGANIZATION have expressed serious interest in the right-handed pitcher.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have been fairly aggressive in pushing PERSON, who they signed in August 2010, sending him to the advanced short-season LOCATION for his GPE debut in 2012 and then to the full-season ORGANIZATION in 2013. The ORGANIZATION felt the teenager could handle the assignments largely because of his defense. He flashes an outstanding glove and uses his excellent speed to have good range. He runs well on the basepaths, too, and should be a base-stealing threat. He's never going to hit for much power, but the switch-hitter has shown an ability to make consistent contact.",1
"At the start of his professional career, PERSON was undoubtedly known more for being PERSON's cousin than anything else. But after the non-drafted free agent hit over .300 three years in a row, including his .327 average en route to winning the Triple-A PERSON MVP award, he's created a name for himself. When he kept on hitting in the ORGANIZATION last fall, the ORGANIZATION added him to the 40-man roster.PERSON' offensive transformation began three years ago, in 2016, when he had to go back and repeat the LOCATION League after a pedestrian 2015 season there. He made some adjustments and hasn't stopped doing so since, showing an innate ability to make hard contact. He's mixed in a leg kick that helps him stay back, allowing him to add more leverage and power. While he doesn't walk much, he also keeps his strikeouts low.A very natural and easy defender, PERSON is like his cousin with his terrific instincts at the hot corner. After playing a lot of first base early in his career, he started mixing it back in during the 2018 season, with the versatility giving his bat a better chance to break into the big leagues.",0
"PERSON was frustrating for scouts earlier in his high school career, as his quick arm was obscured by a long arm action and inconsistent delivery that led to inconsistent secondary pitches and command. Just before the draft, his quick arm sped up even quicker and early in pro ball, he was able to make his arm action a little shorter, unlocking perhaps the best fastball in the minor leagues. Depending on the gun, PERSON tops out at 102 or 105 mph and his plus slider gives him a clear second weapon. As you may guess, there's some command concerns, his changeup is still inconsistent and there's natural health questions simply because throwing that hard puts a greater level of stress on your arm than throwing 90 mph. He's now performed at the upper level and is ready to finetune his game with a big league look in 2018.",1
"So unpolished is PERSON that the ORGANIZATION omitted him from 40-man protection in November and he went unpicked in the Rule 5 draft. The quality of his at-bats remains inconsistent and he has yet to have a strong full-season statistical campaign. But he's an above-average athlete with middle infield actions, a good frame, and very attractive left-handed swing. Solely on hand talent and defensive profile, we think PERSON has considerable upside, but there's a chance he's just always a frustrating guess hitter. PERSON will be the age of most college juniors next year and he's already had a taste of Hi-A. Were he a junior at an ORGANIZATION school, he'd be the kind of talent that goes in the second round if he turns a corner during the spring and performs, and in the fourth round if he doesn't.",0
"PERSON received the largest bonus PERSON paid during the 2013-14 international signing period, getting $650,000 out of the ORGANIZATION. He has yet to complete a fully healthy season, missing most of his 2015 GPE debut with hamstring issues and losing more than two months last year when an errant pitch broke his left forearm. PERSON originally caught PERSON's eye with his quick right-handed bat, and his outstanding bat speed gives him plus raw power. He could hit 15 homers per season if he adds strength and tones down his aggressive approach. He lacks polish at the plate, which is understandable considering he's 20 and totaled just 391 plate appearances in his first three pro seasons.PERSON has bounced among different positions, playing mostly shortstop in his pro debut, spending 2016 at third base and settling at second base this season. His strong arm would work anywhere in the infield, but he fits best at the hot corner because his speed and quickness are just average.",0
"PERSON is comparable to the high school pitching prospects who are selected at the back of the first or in the early second round. Like most well-regarded teenage arms, PERSON throws in the mid-90s, flashes impact breaking stuff (he'll snap off the occasional plus-plus slider), and is athletic enough for proponents to project in the areas where he is currently deficient. His long, deep, plunging arm action is quite violent and he has walked 12% of hitters he's faced during his career, so there's considerable relief risk here, but it's not uncommon for teenage arms with this kind of stuff to struggle with strike throwing for a while. PERSON' stuff is good enough that, even if he turns into a crass, imprecise strike-thrower, it gives him a sizable margin for error within the hitting zone. He'll also have to develop a better changeup. There's mid-rotation upside here if that stuff comes, but it's more likely PERSON will be a dominant bullpen piece or inefficient backend starter.",0
"PERSON may not be quite as advanced as the other top high school pitching prospects in the 2015 Draft, but he may deliver quality velocity as easily as any of them. He works at 90-92 mph and tops out at 96 while looking like he's just playing catch. He could sit in the mid-90s once he fills out his 6-foot-4 frame and gets more consistent. While his curveball and changeup have a ways to go, PERSON has some power and depth to his breaking ball and some fade and deception to his changeup. His athleticism and lack of effort in his delivery bode well for his ability to throw strikes.He's part of the same ORGANIZATION Community program that spawned PERSON, who went on to GPE PERSON and became the 13th overall pick in the 2014 Draft. PERSON has committed to PERSON.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 4, 2017 - PERSON, Calif.Favorite MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON has earned a national name based on his play on the travel ball circuit with ORGANIZATION. With the team, he has earned five positions on All-Tournament Teams, one most Valuable Player honor (2016 PG World Series) and three ORGANIZATION Championships.The Oklahoma commit was also awarded with a 2015 ORGANIZATION and a 2016 Underclass 2nd Team position, in addition to being selected to play in the 2016 ORGANIZATION Showcase.The infielder is big and strong with a tall body. At the plate, he likes to pull the ball and has an arc swing, but he makes hard contact to the left side. With minor mechanical adjustments to his swing, PERSON looks like he could be a corner player who can handle the bat.",0
" In terms of pure raw tools, no one stands ahead of PERSON in the ORGANIZATION' organization. The 2013 season looked like the one where he would translate those tools into consistent performance, until he was suspended for 50 games for ORGANIZATION use in the wake of the ORGANIZATION investigation. PERSON still has a good deal of raw power and the bat speed to be a good all-around hitter. He needs to continue to refine his approach at the plate so he can tap into that power, something that started to come in 2013. He has good speed and a very strong arm from the outfield, with the chance to be an above-average defender, either in center or right field. He'll need to prove to everyone that his breakout wasn't drug-enhanced after he returns from his suspension.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have allowed PERSON, a high school draftee in 2008, to develop at his own pace and the end result might be a guy who can sit in the middle of a big league rotation in the very near future. He can sometimes touch the mid-90s with his fastball but will sit in the 92-93 mph range. His slider is his out pitch, a hard, sharp breaking ball heâll throw at any time to any hitter. His changeup is below-average but he does show some feel for it at times. Heâs inconsistent with all of his stuff, as well as his command, but heâll also be pitching at the highest level of the Minors all season at age 23.",1
"PERSON began the 2013 showcase circuit by winning the home run derby at the ORGANIZATION and never stopped hitting the ball out of the park. He slammed 13 homers as a high school senior last spring, leading PERSON More High (ORGANIZATION) to the ORGANIZATION 4-A state title, and wowed the ORGANIZATION in a pre-Draft workout. They drafted him 40th overall and signed him for $1.35 million.In his pro debut, PERSON finished fourth in homers (seven) and third in strikeouts (81) as the youngest regular in the Rookie-level GPE. He generates his plus power with bat speed and leverage. He shows some selectivity at the plate, leading to hopes that he'll post decent batting averages and solid on-base percentages down the road.PERSON has the raw arm strength desired behind the plate, though he'll have to improve his transfer and accuracy to get the most out of it. He moves better than most catchers but his receiving and blocking also require a lot of work. There's no reason yet to think he can't stay behind the plate, but if he can't he has enough power and agility to profile as a corner outfielder.",0
"GPE is one of the youngest players in the draft class and flashes five tools that are average or better, including a long track record of making hard contact.",0
"Originally signed by the ORGANIZATION for $75,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2009, PERSON began turning heads by hitting 100 mph with his fastball when he made his GPE debut three years later. But he also struggled to refine his secondary pitches and his command, and GPE shipped him to the FACILITY in July 2013 as part of a three-team trade that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION. Despite missing two months in 2014 after having meniscus surgeries on both knees, PERSON took a huge step forward in his development. He pitched well at Double-A in 2015 and made his big league debut in September before being traded to the ORGANIZATION as part of the three-team deal that sent PERSON from GPE to the FACILITY in December.PERSON continues to bring the heat, working at 93-97 mph, peaking at 102 and imparting some sink and cut on his fastball. His mid-80s slider can reach 88 mph and be a well above-average pitch at its best, though it also flattens out and gets hittable. PERSON, he can show feel for a changeup with fade at times but have the pitch look like a batting-practice fastball at times.Built more like a young PERSON than his generously listed weight of 185 pounds would suggest, PERSON has cleaned up his delivery and done a better job of throwing strikes since changing organizations. Provided that he continues to make improvements and gains more consistency, he could be a No. 2 starter. If he doesn't, he could wind up as a reliever, albeit with the upside of a closer.",1
"PERSON drew some mild scouting interest as a senior at GPE (PERSON) PERSON in 2016, but not enough to divert him from attending PERSON A&M. He won LOCATION Freshman of the Year honors and helped the Aggies reach the ORGANIZATION World Series in 2017, then shifted to shortstop as a sophomore. Of the half-dozen college players at that position who have legitimate first-round aspirations in 2019, he might be the best pure hitter.His outstanding hand-eye coordination allows PERSON to put the bat on the ball with ease. A left-handed hitter who's a bit unorthodox at the plate, he tends to get caught out on his front foot but still has the dexterity to slap singles to the opposite field. He also has the bat speed and leverage in his still-projectable 6-foot-4 frame to turn on balls, hinting at average power in his future.PERSON grew up around the game because his father PERSON is the head coach at PERSON-Dallas, and his instincts are apparent on the bases and in the field. He has a knack for stealing bases despite average speed and makes plays at shortstop. His arm is more accurate than strong, leading some scouts to project him as a second baseman, and he has the versatility and selflessness to fit anywhere in the infield.",0
"The ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the third round of the 2014 Draft out of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks. The projectable left-hander opened his first full pro season in the Rookie-level GPE, and he was pitching well there when the ORGANIZATION acquired him at the ORGANIZATION in the PERSON deal. In 2016, PERSON was having an uneven pro debut at ORGANIZATION A PERSON when he landed on the disabled list in June with an oblique strain. At 6-foot-5, 185 pounds, PERSON' frame offers a lot to dream on. So does his four-pitch mix. He can hit 93 mph with his fastball but usually sits around 89-91, using his height to create a steep downhill plane. His low-70s curveball is his best secondary offering, and he also throws a slurvy slider in the low 80s. PERSON made progress developing a changeup last season, though it lags behind his other offerings. He can throw strikes with his entire arsenal and is naturally tough to barrel.The ORGANIZATION expect PERSON to return to the mound in the near future and hope that he can make up for some of the time he lost while injured. He may be raw, but PERSON has the tools to become a back-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"At the start of the summer, PERSON was thought of as a decent high school prospect from LOCATION. By the time the showcase circuit was over, the outfielder had emerged as one of the best high school bats in the nation. He cemented that reputation by continuing to rake all spring.While PERSON was thought as the top ORGANIZATION high school outfielder, there are now scouts who feel PERSON has caught up, if not passed, him. That's largely because of PERSON's hit tool and his ability to stay in center field long-term. PERSON makes consistent hard contact against high levels of competition. He has a good approach at the plate and can spray line drives to all fields. PERSON has more doubles power now, but there's room in his frame to add strength. His above-average speed works on both sides of the ball, and some see a future ORGANIZATION caliber center fielder. PERSON gets high marks for his baseball instincts and effort.The ORGANIZATION commit has shown an ability to slow the game down as the competition improves. That should bode well for him at the next level and it would shock few if he ended up being the first high school hitter taken in the first round.",0
"PERSON flashed a mid-90s fastball in the ORGANIZATION during the summer of 2013, then pitched at 88-92 mph the following spring at ORGANIZATION. GPE signed him in the 19th round for $100,000, but he blew out his elbow after a strong pro debut and missed the entire 2015 season. He worked just 16 2/3 innings in his return to the mound last year, and that was enough to establish himself as the best lefty relief prospect in the system and earn a non-roster invitation to Spring Training.In his return, PERSON showed an at-times overpowering fastball and the potential for a plus slider. His heater sat at 95-97 mph and peaked at 99, generating strikeouts as well as groundouts. His slider climbed into the high 80s, though it can get slurvy at times.PERSON still has to prove he can carry that kind of stuff through a full season, but the FACILITY understandably are excited by the early stages of his comeback. He'll need to sharpen his control as well, though he shows some ability to work the bottom of the strike zone. If he's for real, he could become a late-inning option for GPE in the near future.",1
"GPE posted promising strikeout and walk rates in the early part of his career and then suddenly began hitting for power in 2015 and 2016 at ORGANIZATION before returning to career norms in 2017. On paper, GPE was very intriguing as a young pro because he played shortstop and had such terrific control of the strike zone, but eyeball evaluations were more generic, indicating a bench role at best, and were incongruous with GPE's performance, especially when he suddenly had power. He was sidelined for much of 2018 after he was struck by a pitch on the foot, but he put enough balls in play to note that his pull rate was up and his ground ball rate was down, and a hitter with this kind of innate talent would suddenly become very interesting if a swing change were to coax out some more power. At 25, GPE is probably just an up/down utility type, but that's also what we thought about PERSON at this time last year.",1
" GPE has hit his way up to the highest level of the ORGANIZATION. The 2012 season was no different as he won the organizational batting title while finishing fifth in hits and third in ORGANIZATION during his first taste of Triple-A. Heâs a free swinger, generating bat speed with his big swing. Heâs a good fastball hitter with mostly pull power. He wonât walk much, but he doesnât strike out much, either. He has good instincts on the bases as well. Heâs a fringy defender who can make the routine plays at third and has a solid arm. Itâs his bat, though, that will get him to the big leagues.",0
"In three years at ORGANIZATION, PERSON went from pitching three innings as a freshman to starring as a reliever as a sophomore to moving into the rotation and becoming the ORGANIZATION. 4 overall pick in the 2015 Draft as a junior. After he signed with the ORGANIZATION for $4.2 million, his stuff regressed and he fell out of favor quickly. PERSON dealt him with relief prospects PERSON and PERSON to get PERSON from the ORGANIZATION in the summer of 2016, and after parts of three seasons in GPE's system, PERSON was traded once again -- this time to Baltimore along with PERSON and PERSON in exchange for PERSON Britton.PERSON resisted incorporating some delivery changes the ORGANIZATION wanted in his first full pro season, after which his fastball dipped into the upper 80s and his secondary pitches flattened out. Since GPE allowed him to return to his college mechanics after the trade, his four-seam fastball again sits at 93-95 mph and tops out at 98, and he's incorporated a two-seamer to induce ground balls. Both his hard slider and changeup show signs of becoming plus offerings, though his slider isn't as sharp as it was at ORGANIZATION while his changeup has improved.Whether PERSON will wind up as a starter or reliever is unclear. Though he throws strikes with all four of his pitches, he doesn't miss as many bats as he should with his pure stuff, which could play up in shorter stints. He has added some strength since turning pro but still has to prove his durability after missing time with hamstring issues (2016), shoulder woes (2017) and a quad injury (2018).",0
"PERSON missed all of 2018 due to a February PERSON from which he'll likely return sometime during extended spring training. Tall and projectable, PERSON was already touching 96 as an 18-year-old before he blew out his ORGANIZATION. He's athletic for his size but perhaps not exceptionally athletic in a vacuum, his forearms appear shorter than is typical for someone his size, and his stride home is very abbreviated. His velocity and changeup quality were both well ahead of what is typical for a pitcher this age before PERSON got hurt, and he has one of the more intriguing ceilings in the system if those things return after surgery.",0
"PERSON's 2018 foray into full-season ball (.272/.348/.477 in May, June and July) was bookended by two awful months (he hit .180 in GPE, .215 in GPE) resulting in a .245/.321/.421 line. Already at physical maturity, PERSON's huge power is the foundation of his profile. He's capable of hitting long home runs to left and center, and he has the raw strength to drive out mis-hit balls the opposite way. Everything else he does is average. PERSON at identifying breaking balls in mid air, PERSON's moderate swing-and-miss issues stem from his mediocre bat control. This might limit his game power output, but the issues aren't so bad that we're worried about PERSON not hitting entirely. He has below-average range and instincts in right field, but his arm is plus. PERSON will likely start next season, age-20, at Hi-A. He projects as a middle-of-the-order power bat who provides little value on defense. ",0
"PERSON broke out as a sophomore in 2016, leading the Big East Conference in strikeouts (84 in 102 innings) and outpitching ORGANIZATION supplemental first-rounder PERSON to beat PERSON in the ORGANIZATION regional playoffs. He continued to raise his profile in the ORGANIZATION, which he led in strikeouts (54), whiffs per nine innings (13.6) and K/BB ratio (13.5), and then set a Xavier school record for strikeouts (115) while finishing fourth in ORGANIZATION Division I in whiff rate (13.3). The GPE, coveting PERSON's bat-missing ability, selected him with the ORGANIZATION. 74 overall pick in second competitive balance round.The amazing thing about PERSON's success is that his best pitch is a fastball that sits at 87-89 mph and tops out at 93. It plays well above its mediocre velocity because it features running life, he commands it well and the deception in his delivery leads to a lot of uncomfortable swings. He's unlikely to throw much harder because he's already physically mature at 6-foot-2 and 235 pounds.PERSON pitches off his fastball well, increasing the effectiveness of an above-average curveball and changeup that ranges from fringy to average. His control wasn't as sharp this spring as it was a year ago, though he was more unhittable than ever. He'll have to prove that his modest arsenal will work in pro ball, though his track record suggests that it would be foolish to bet against him.",0
"What a roller coaster of a career it has already been for PERSON, who looked like a possible top three pick as a college sophomore, faltered as a junior, appeared reborn once free of seemingly poor college instruction, then collapsed again in 2018 when he was hurt for a time (forearm), and had more walks than innings pitched. 
At his best, PERSON will sit 94-97 early in starts and both his breaking balls will be plus. Last year his velo was down, sometimes into the upper-80s. PERSON is built like an PERSON, and it's fair to anticipate mechanical consistency arriving late for an athlete built like that. But he turns 25 this year and even if his stuff bounces back, we think he'll just end up in a relief role.",0
"PERSON's father PERSON was a two-time first-round choice (1983 January and 1984 June secondary ORGANIZATIONs) who caught briefly in the big leagues with the 1988 Cardinals. PERSON was a 30th-round pick out of an Illinois high school by the ORGANIZATION in the 2016, sliding because of his commitment to GPE, and scouts thought he had the chance to emerge as a first-rounder after three years of college. That won't quite happen, though a surge in the month leading up to the ORGANIZATION could carry him as high as the third round.While PERSON doesn't have loud tools, he's a steady performer in all facets of the game. He has improved offensively throughout his college career, making regular contact to all fields from the right side of the plate. He's not a slugger but he has a strong 6-foot-3 frame and has hit the ball harder this spring, so he could have 12-15 home run power if he continues to develop.PERSON has average to above-average speed and good savvy on the bases. He's not the rangiest shortstop, though he makes plays with his reliable hands and solid, accurate arm. If he can't stick at shortstop, he might not produce enough offense to profile as a regular at second or third base, but he does have a high floor as a utilityman.",0
"PERSON PERSON recruited the mostly anonymous PERSON when he was an assistant coach at ORGANIZATION (S.C.) JC, and he pushed the ORGANIZATION to draft the right-hander in the 48th round in the 2011 Draft after becoming an area scout. PERSON signed for $50,000 and swiftly became one of GPE' top pitching prospects before joining the GPE in the ORGANIZATION trade in July 2013. He missed most of the 2014 season with a strained right shoulder that GPE decided to handle cautiously but looked at full strength in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON usually operates in the low 90s with his fastball and has reached 97 mph, but the velocity doesn't matter as much as its natural cutting life. Hitters rarely make hard contact against his heater and have tagged him for just two homers in 237 innings through three pro seasons. His secondary pitches continue to improve, with his curveball now sitting in the upper 70s with good depth and his changeup featuring some splitter action.PERSON' offerings have so much life that they're not always easy to control. He's a good athlete, however, and should develop at least average control. Concerns that his extremely skinny frame may not be suited for a heavy workload led the GPE to shift him to relief in 2015, though it's possible he could return to starting in the future.",1
"It's not a great Draft for college shortstops, and PERSON is a candidate to be the first one picked who definitely can remain at the position in the Majors. He could go around the third round, which is exactly where recent ORGANIZATION shortstops and eventual big leaguers PERSON, PERSON and PERSON were chosen.Thanks to his quick feet and hands and his strong arm, PERSON can make highlight plays at shortstop. He also can get too flashy for his own good and will have to improve his defensive consistency. His tools will allow him to play multiple positions as a utilityman if he doesn't hit enough to be a regular in pro ball.Whether PERSON can remains to be seen. A former switch-hitter who now bats strictly right-handed, he employs a contact approach that yields very little power. Though he's just an average runner out of the batter's box, he's quicker once he gets going and has some basestealing savvy.",0
"GPE's top high school prospect in 2015, PERSON drew some Ben Revere comparisons but shocked the ORGANIZATION with his ability to drive the ball to all fields during a pre-GPE workout at FACILITY. They made him one of four players they gave a seven-figure bonus to in the GPE, signing him away from a ORGANIZATION commitment with a $1.3 million bonus in the fourth round.PERSON's best tool is his well above-average speed, which helps him reach base, wreak havoc once he does and play a quality center field. He focuses on putting the ball in play with his compact left-handed swing and has enough sneaky power to produce double-digit home run totals. Though he didn't go deep in his 22-game pro debut, he did finish second in GPE's instructional league home run derby.PERSON has excellent instincts in center field, with his quickness, reads and routes combining to give him plenty of range. He has an average, accurate arm as well.",0
"PERSON was the most polished of the teenage prospects the ORGANIZATION pushed to the ORGANIZATION last year, and while his raw numbers were only impressive if viewed with his age in mind, his peripherals (11% walk rate, 19% strikeout rate) were marvelous. Quite soft-bodied as an amateur, PERSON has reshaped his physique and is now a svelte 6-foot-3 and an average runner underway, and it plays a little better than that on the bases because he is a max-effort player. Most amateur scouts had him projected to first base, but he now has a chance to not just stick in a corner outfield spot, but perhaps be above-average there. 
PERSON what PERSON is best at is hitting. He has terrific timing and feel for contact, as well as a growing idea of which pitches to attack to hit for power. His ground ball rate was down last year and while there's still room for growth in this area, the fact that PERSON has already shown movement here is a sign more will come. Unless the hit and power tools grow beyond what we expect, it's unlikely that PERSON becomes a star, but we consider him a strong bet to be an everyday big leaguer, and his makeup and polish make him an unusually high-probability bet in our estimation.",0
"The way teams value PERSON depends on whether or not they feel confident the ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION will re-write service academy athlete policy. PERSON, PERSON must complete two years of GPE service. This administration may reinstate an Obama-era rule that allows athletes to petition for an exemption to pursue sports. If that rule were currently in place, PERSON would go in the top 50. He throws hard, attacks hitters with his fastball and slider, and will mix in the occasional knee-buckling, rainbow curveball. If teams think PERSON will have to serve and thus won't be able to pitch again until he's 24, he'll fall to Day 3.",0
"In a Draft class short on good college bats, GPE stood out as one of the better ones, coming from a strong GPE program. That's why the ORGANIZATION took him No. 16 overall and signed him for more than $500,000 under pick value. The left-handed hitting GPE has long impressed with the bat. Hitting 10 homers both as a sophomore and a junior is quite an achievement, given how pitching-friendly GPE's home park is. He has an advanced approach at the plate and solid power, especially on the extra-base front, though he should have some over-the-fence pop at the next level. He walked more than he struck out during his college career and he continued to swing the bat well during his pro debut, quickly moving to full-season ball.A catcher in college, scouts questioned whether he could stay back there given how raw his defensive skills were. The ORGANIZATION had him playing first base only during his pro debut and that's likely to be his long-term defensive home, with the ORGANIZATION believing the bat will play at the corner position as well.",1
"They say a little adversity can be an outstanding teaching tool. If that's the case, PERSON could be ready for a big jump forward after what many perceived to be a bit of a step backward.The GPE teenager, who signed for $2.6 million, came to Spring Training in 2013 out of shape, and his performance, as well as the amount of innings he was able to log, did not live up to expectations. Still, PERSON did manage to compete in full-season ball at a young age despite struggling with command and fastball velocity as a result of his conditioning. When he's right, he's shown the ability to deliver a fastball that hits the mid-90s, a hard curve and a changeup.The Pirates were encouraged that PERSON started taking his conditioning seriously, but he missed two months in 2014 with shoulder soreness, once again cutting into his development time.",0
"The Big 12 Conference pitcher of the year in 2013, PERSON beat out ORGANIZATION. 3 overall pick PERSON among others after missing the previous season recovering from PERSON surgery. He turned down the Phillies in the 33rd round to return for his redshirt junior season in 2014, when the ORGANIZATION made him an eighth-rounder. Put on the fast track because of his age (22 when he signed) and strike-throwing ability, he reached Triple-A PERSON a month into his second full pro season.PERSON's best offering unquestionably is his changeup, a plus offering at times that tumbles at the plate. His fastball sits around 90 mph but he makes it work thanks to command and deception. He never has had much of a breaking ball and his slider remains fringy. He may have just one pitch that qualifies as even average, but that doesn't stop PERSON from challenging hitters and pounding the strike zone. He has little margin for error, a point that was driven home when he gave up 17 homers in 19 starts at hitter-friendly PERSON. He's on the verge of reaching GPE as a No. 5 starter or middle reliever.",0
"The younger brother of GPE prospect PERSON, 'Bo' is a better athlete with similar feel to hit, but less raw power. He has the neccesary twitch and just enough pure arm strength to catch as long as his throws becaome more accurate. There's a subsection of teams who like him better at third base because they think he'll move more quickly through the minors by avoiding the developmental burdens of catching and/or because the physical grind of catching often dilutes offensive production. PERSON is athletic enough for this, as well. Even if PERSON's in-game power manifests itself as doubles, he profiles at either spot.",1
"PERSON was thought to be the best high school hitter in the 2014 Draft class, if not the top bat overall, and was in conversations for the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick. The ORGANIZATION got him at ORGANIZATION. 6 and quickliy moved the high school catcher to the outfield, thinking his bat would carry him up the ladder quickly. Instead, he made very little progress -- he did show a little more pop in his bat in 2016 -- and PERSON sent him to the ORGANIZATION in return for pitchers PERSON and PERSON last ORGANIZATIONvember.The first thing the ORGANIZATION did was move PERSON back behind the plate, thinking he could have more value there than in an outfield corner. PERSON embraced the move back behind the plate with open arms and made early improvements with his hands and mobility, and he's always had a strong arm. There is less pressure to produce offensively compared to an outfield corner, and that could help PERSON relax at the plate, where he's been slow to make adjustments.PERSON eased into full-time catching by splitting time between being behind the plate and DHing. It looks like a new home and new position is helping him wipe the slate clean and start over again.",1
"The summer before his senior year of high school, PERSON looked like a relatively unprojectable pitchability lefty, albeit an advanced one. His fastball was only in the 88-92 range at ORGANIZATION, though his changeup and curveball were each above-average. He did not throw during the fall and instead devoted more time to working out. The following spring, with a new physique, PERSON's stuff was way up across the board, his fastball now sitting comfortably in the mid-90s, touching 97. Four starts into his senior season, PERSON tore his ORGANIZATION and need PERSON. 
After most of the first three rounds of the 2016 draft had come and gone it seemed as though PERSON might end up at the ORGANIZATION of GPE. Four outings (including the one during which he broke) was not enough time for many teams to have high-level decision makers in to see him and take him early, but the ORGANIZATION (who have a history of drafting pitchers who have fallen due to injury) called his name and signed him for $1.4 million, a bonus equivalent to an early second rounder. PERSON rehabbed as a ORGANIZATION and continued to strengthen his body. When he returned the following summer, his stuff had completely returned. He made just three starts for the ORGANIZATION before he was traded to GPE as part of the LOCATION Doolittle/Ryan PERSON deal. 
He has quickly climbed GPE's minor league ladder and reached Triple-A at age 20 in 2018. Those crafty pitchability traits from high school are still extant. PERSON will vary the shape of his breaking ball -- he can throw it for strikes to get ahead of hitters, he back foot it to righties -- and he uses his changeup against lefties and righties. His delivery is a bit violent but it doesn't inhibit his command, and PERSON's musculature seems better able to deal with the effort than it was when he was in high school. His fastball, which has been up to 97 in his big league appearances this spring, may not play like a mid-90s heater because he is undersized and a short-strider, but he locates it well enough to avoid getting hurt. 
He has mid-rotation upside and is abnormally polished. We may see him in GPE this year.",0
"The ORGANIZATION took GPE out of ORGANIZATION in the second round of the 2014 Draft, right after they took fellow college infielder PERSON a round earlier, because they liked GPE' all-around tools at third. He has shown glimpses of all of them thus far in his pro career, with the only question being if he'll make enough contact to get the chance to use them regularly.There is no question GPE will have to cut down on the swing and miss. He struck out more than 30 percent of the time in 2015 and that is not a sustainable rate at any level. If he can refine his approach, he will be able to tap into his considerable raw power more consistently. GPE is a very good athlete with the chance to be a well above-average third baseman defensively. He moves well, throws well and has above-average speed.As rough as it was for GPE in the ORGANIZATION State League, the ORGANIZATION were pleased that he did improve in the second half. There is some upside here, with perhaps a career that could be like a better defensive version of PERSON.",0
"PERSON was on the radar early and drawing comps to lower-slot elite lefties in the draft like PERSON did when he was a prep underclassman. His velo was around 88-91 with a lower slot most of the showcase circuit, then he showed mostly 90-93, touching 96 mph this spring, sometimes flashing a consistently solid average breaker and at other times struggling to land it. His low-spin splitter is a true plus pitch if not closer to 70. He was shut down late in the season with a shoulder muscle strain but hit 96 mph in a private workout with PERSON, so the health scare looks to be behind him. Clubs that like the separator splitter, two-way athleticism, and deceptive velo will bet they can figure out the command/breaker, while others see a lefty with inconsistent stuff and arm slot who relies on a splitter.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON hails from a true baseball family. His father, PERSON, was a big leaguer who played for the ORGANIZATION for three years and brother, GPE, is a top prospect in the ORGANIZATION' farm system. The FACILITY commit helped lead PERSON to an ORGANIZATION Division I state championship, notching the school's fourth title in the past 14 years. In the championship-clinching game, PERSON notched a win by pitching four scoreless innings.The athletic infield prospect is still developing as a hitter, but his swing and bat speed show potential. In the field, he is solid defensively and has an average arm as well.",0
"PERSON made steady progress on the showcase circuit in 2013, and a strong start to last spring positioned him to become the first GPE high school pitcher drafted in the first round since PERSON in 1990. But then a minor shoulder strain sidelined him for three weeks, scuttling his chances. The ORGANIZATION were so thrilled to get him at ORGANIZATION. 56 that they paid him $1.8 million, the largest bonus in the second round.PERSON has the look of a power pitcher. He already has a big league body at 6-foot-6 and 210 pounds, and his athleticism and sound delivery are uncommon for a teenager his size. He usually pitches in the low 90s with sink and has hit 96 mph, with the promise of more velocity as he gets stronger.His high-three-quarters arm slot helps PERSON stay on top of his tight curveball. His changeup and command are still in the early stages of their development, but it everything comes together he could be a frontline starter.",0
"After undergoing PERSON surgery during his sophomore year at ORGANIZATION, PERSON proved he was fully recovered a year later as the ORGANIZATION' ace. His success that spring helped convince the ORGANIZATION to make him a first-round pick in 2013.PERSON's fastball sits in the mid-90s, with heavy sinking action. He pounds the strike zone with it, helping him create plenty of ground-ball outs. PERSON's changeup and slider aren't as advanced as his fastball, but both have the potential to become PERSON average offerings.The ORGANIZATION have shown a willingness to move top college starters quickly, and PERSON's pitchability and three-pitch mix could help put him on a similarly aggressive track to the ORGANIZATION.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have a terrific young catching tandem in PERSON and ORGANIZATION, who we project to play a glove-centric second fiddle to PERSON's bat for the next half decade. ORGANIZATION has been lauded for his defense since high school, and he remains excellent back there, and has a plus arm. He has struggled in the past to lift the ball, and while he showed some movement in that regard last year, it's unlikely that ORGANIZATION hits enough to profile as an everyday catcher.",1
" One of the youngest prospects in the class, GPE has the potential to be one of the best players overall.The center fielder has impressed scouts with his defense, running ability and arm strength, leading some to believe that he could be an above-average center fielder when he learns how to harness all of his skills. The top prospect in the ORGANIZATION (ORGANIZATION), GPE's bat speed and ability to hit for average and power has impressed scouts. GPE starred for the ORGANIZATION team that toured GPE last spring and has competed against the best players in the ORGANIZATION Republic.A plus-runner and arguably the best athlete in this year's class, GPE won't be able to sign with a Major League club until he turns 16 on Aug. 1. Scouts believe he has the potential to be a five-tool player and will improve his all-around game as he matures.",0
"Born in GPE, PERSON went to high school in GPE and played collegiately at ORGANIZATION, where he was one of the better two-way players in the nation. He won 11 games in three seasons for the Lobos but made a bigger impression as an outfielder, batting .361/.500/.589 with 14 steals and a school-record 58 walks as a junior in 2017. Signed for a below-slot $517,000 as a third-rounder, he looked a bit worn out during his pro debut but still led low Class A Kannapolis with 38 walks in just 63 games.PERSON excels at controlling the strike zone, drawing 124 free passes against just 71 whiffs in three years of college and logging a 14 percent walk rate in his debut. With his sound left-handed swing, line-drive approach and plate discipline, he should be able to hit for average. He won't hit for much power, though he can pull the ball out of the park on occasion and might produce double-digit home run totals.PERSON has solid speed and the savvy to steal a few bases. His quickness also plays well in center field, where he shows good instincts. With a left arm that could push a fastball into the low 90s at times, he can play all three outfield spots, though his arm strength was down for much of his debut before rebounding in instructional league.",0
"One of the top young pitching prospects to leave the island, the right-hander was the ORGANIZATION of the Year during the 2013-14 season. He went 5-5 with a 3.90 ERA during his rookie season, primarily pitching out of the bullpen. He also sported a 2.45 ERA as a reliever during the 2014-15 season.It's his experience pitching successfully at a high level combined with a fastball in the low 90s and a plus curveball that leads some scouts to believe PERSON could be a better prospect than fellow GPE right-hander PERSON, 19, who signed $16 million deal with the Dodgers.PERSON projects as a starter, but some evaluators think he could also have success at the ORGANIZATION level pitching out of the bullpen, possibly as a closer, at least initially.PERSON was selected to represent his country in an international tournament but left his GPE del Rio team during the LOCATION in February in GPE, PERSON. He made his way to GPE, where he eventually established residency in May. He was declared a free agent by PERSON on July 7, making him eligible to sign during the 2015-2016 international signing period that began on July 2.",0
"PERSON pitched just three innings as a freshman at ORGANIZATION, then became the ORGANIZATION' closer and starred with the GPE collegiate national team as a sophomore. Moved to the rotation this spring, he emerged as a candidate for the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in the ORGANIZATION and went fourth to the ORGANIZATION, who signed him for $4.2 million.PERSON had the best pure stuff in GPE USA's talented bullpen, and he was able to maintain it as a starter. He has two well above-average pitches, pairing a lively 92-98 mph fastball with a sharp 85-89 mph slider. His changeup has improved since he began throwing it more often and could give him a solid third offering.His stuff faded a bit toward the end of the college season as he blew well past his career high in innings, but most scouts believe PERSON can make it as a starter. His athleticism helps him throw strikes and bodes well for his durability and his ability to smooth out a delivery that features some effort.",0
"Sometimes repeating a level can do wonders for a prospect's career. Case in point is PERSON, who had to go back to the GPE League after scuffling there in 2015. The former ORGANIZATION farmhand, who came to the D-backs in the three-team trade that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION, hit his way out of the level in 2016 and kept on performing well in Double-A, all at the age of 20. However, his progress was slowed in 2017 by a shoulder injury that kept him out of action for a couple of months. PERSON excels with an innate ability to find the barrel of the bat, especially from the left side of the plate. He's a free swinger with tremendous hand-eye coordination, but one of the keys to his step forward last season was improved plate discipline and a better walk rate. That allowed him to increase his extra-base output, and he could eventually be a 10-12 home run kind of hitter. PERSON has played more shortstop than anywhere else since joining the organization and can make all the plays there. He's also shown the ability to play a more-than-capable second base. PERSON raised the bar a bit following his first full season in the organization but didn't get to replicate it because of injury in 2017. He still has the potential to be an everyday shortstop, but he could also move around to create more opportunities to get his bat into the lineup once he's ready for the big leagues.",1
"PERSON boosted his ORGANIZATION stock in the 2016 GPE ORGANIZATION, where he showcased the circuit's best arm and shut down the GPE collegiate national team for six innings in a June start. He began his junior year as a starter before being asked to fill PERSON' void at closer and cashing in on his first two save opportunities, but he subsequently lost command of the strike zone and returned to the rotation before going to the Nationals in the sixth round that June. He was used as a starter and reliever in his first full season, faring better in the latter role as he finished the year at ORGANIZATION A Advanced ORGANIZATION. Moved to the rotation full-time in 2019, PERSON took quickly to the new role and was pitching well back at ORGANIZATION before going to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION. PERSON's fastball and slider both are viewed as plus pitches, giving him an ideal pairing for a long-term bullpen role. His heater registers in the low- to mid-90s, at times bumping higher, with arm-side run and late sinking action that nets him a lot of weakly-hit contact. His slider plays more like a cutter, sitting at 88-90 mph with darting action, and he also has a changeup that could become a serviceable pitch if he uses it more often.There is a lot of effort in PERSON's inconsistent overhand delivery, and it in turn impedes his ability to throw strikes. But with two big league-caliber pitches, PERSON has the raw ingredients to become an effective reliever at the highest level.",0
"  GPE appeared to be on his way to becoming a top 10 pick in the 2014 GPE until he underwent PERSON surgery in May. Despite the injury, he didn't fall far on GPE day, as the ORGANIZATION grabbed him 18th overall. When healthy, GPE usually deals fastballs at 91-93 mph and has reached as high as 95, and the pitch plays up because it has nice life and he can locate it where he wants. His low-80s slider can be inconsistent but should give him a second plus pitch down the road. He also shows flashes of having a useful changeup. The ORGANIZATION have had success helping young pitchers through PERSON rehab, including 2012 first-rounder PERSON. They will have to be patient as GPE recovers, but he should give their system another premium arm.",1
"With a fine performance on the showcase circuit and a strong start to his senior season, ORGANIZATION' stock was nearly as high as any high school pitcher's at one point during the spring. He cooled off some and dropped to the ORGANIZATION in the third round, where he signed for $1.2 million.ORGANIZATION already operated with a 92-95 mph fastball that peaks at 98, and his projectable 6-foot-3 frame hints at more velocity in the future. His secondary pitches need more consistency, though his breaking balls grade as plus offerings at their best and he'll flash a solid changeup.ORGANIZATION' biggest need at this point is to clean up his delivery, which features more effort than scouts would like. His athleticism bodes well for his ability to refine his mechanics and improve his control and command.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION signed PERSON, a native of GPE, with a $7 million bonus in 2016, they knew they had a player who was glove-first and didn't have much of a hitting resume. That has remained the case after two-plus years of ORGANIZATION baseball. It also puts the organization in a bit of a quandary. Can Alf-Rod's glove alone carry him to the big leagues?Offensively, PERSON hasn't shown much sign of progressing. That could partially be because of a hamate bone issue in 2018 that required two trips to the disabled list. But he also played in the instructional league and PERSON after the season and still didn't hit well. Plate discipline remains a stumbling block as he often swings and misses pitches out of the strike zones. A light hitter like PERSON needs to work counts and draw walks to get on base.The contrast couldn't be wider on the defensive side. His hands could be a 70 on the 20-to-80 scouting scale and he has good range and a plus arm to go with them, making it possible to make all the routine plays and many spectacular ones as well. Although his glove could play in the big leagues, the reality is that PERSON is a projectable utility player at best if he doesn't figure out how to hit.",0
"As a freshman at ORGANIZATION, PERSON lived in the shadows of 2011 first-rounders PERSON and PERSON. He emerged as the ORGANIZATION ace the following year, and then led them to a ORGANIZATION World Series championship in 2013, the same year the ORGANIZATION drafted him in the 11th round. PERSON didn't hit his stride as a professional until his second pro season in 2015, when he paced all ORGANIZATION farmhands with a 2.39 ORGANIZATION and 0.93 WHIP while making 27 starts between Class A Advanced PERSON and Double-A Akron. He enjoyed similar success in his second tour of the LOCATION in 2016, resulting in a mid-season promotion to Triple-A Columbus for the right-hander.PERSON may not have overpowering stuff, but everything he throws plays up thanks to his plus control and feel for sequencing. The right-hander is adept at painting both sides of the plate with his fastball, which usually sits around 90-91 mph but can reach 94. His changeup is his best secondary offering, receiving an above-average grade from scouts, and he knows how to keep hitters off balance with both his slider and curveball, with the former currently ahead of the latter.PERSON's advanced pitchability has helped him make a smooth transition to the ORGANIZATION, but it's the across-the-board improvement of his stuff that has enabled him to move quickly and gives him a real chance to become a back-end starter at the highest level.",0
"The son of four-time All-Star and 20-year Major League veteran PERSON, PERSON batted .337/.412/.539 with nine home runs, 20 doubles and 55 RBIs as a junior for N.C. State, where he was a three-year starter at first base. The ORGANIZATION selected him in the seventh round of the 2016 Draft, but it wasn't until the hours leading up to the July 15 signing deadline that the two sides reached an agreement on a $204,700 bonus.Like his father, PERSON combines bat speed with a sweet left-handed swing, leading scouts to believe he will continue to hit for average in the professional ranks. His power is mostly to the gaps at present, but he has the potential to develop average over-the-fence pop. As a first-base-only prospect with suspect home-run power, GPE might have trouble fulfilling such a limited profile. There's a chance he could move to left field, but with below-average speed, he's probably best suited for a career at his natural position.",0
"After injuring his right elbow as a high school senior in 2012, PERSON had PERSON surgery and redshirted during his first year at FACILITY A&M JC. His velocity spiked when he returned in 2014, prompting the ORGANIZATION to draft him in the 11th round and sign him for $100,000. He advanced to Triple-A in 2017 and then struck out 23 in 11 ORGANIZATION innings, but his 2018 will be put on hold after he drew an 80-game suspension in January after testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance.Houston is still trying to figure out if PERSON will be more valuable in the rotation or bullpen. Pitching out of the rotation, he can sit at 92-93 mph and touch 95 with his fastball while dealing a big-breaking slider in the low 80s. Working as a reliever, PERSON can run his heater up to 97 mph and his slider up to 85.PERSON's changeup shows some signs of becoming an effective third pitch, but it lags behind his other offerings. He has an inconsistent history of providing strikes, but he has made progress in 2017, enhancing his chances of remaining a starter. The ORGANIZATION will continue to develop PERSON in that role, but they may be tempted to expedite him to PERSON as a reliever.",0
PERSON didn't sign as the #1 overall pick last year of GPE due to a failed physical because of his elbow. His medicals are out now and how teams interpret them will dicate if he goes mid-1st round or slides to the 2nd.,0
"Another good looking college bat, PERSON had a very strong Cape League season, finishing second in the summer circuit in home runs. He has legitimate power from the left side of the plate and as he showed with wood bats over the summer and then into his junior year, it should play just fine at the next level. A third baseman for PERSON, it remains to be seen if PERSON can stay at third, with some thinking a defensive move is in store for him. That shouldn't matter. If he reaches his offensive potential, his bat should play just fine at first or a corner outfield spot.PERSON wasn't just a home run hitter on the Cape. In addition to the 13 long balls, which led to a .589 slugging percentage, he hit .291 and finished with a .374 on-base percentage.",0
"PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION in 2007 as a 17-year old in the ORGANIZATION. He struggled to advance past rookie ball for several years, until he broke out in 2013. As a 23-year old, PERSON was named a ORGANIZATION All-Star and reached Double-A Chattanooga at the end of July. PERSON has always struggled with his command, and his resurgence was due in part to his improvement in that area. He throws his fastball in the low-90s with good sinking action. His slider is a good complement to his sinker and produces some swings-and-misses. The ORGANIZATION have used PERSON as both a starter and reliever. His future, however, is likely in the bullpen, where his stuff plays up and he is effective as a setup man.",0
"GPE is one of the more unique high school pitchers in the class, a plus athlete with a funky cross-body delivery, and a dynamic two-pitch mix.",1
"PERSON transferred from GPE to ORGANIZATION after his sophomore year and proceeded to hit .308/.351/.639 with 20 home runs. The ORGANIZATION made him their second-round PERSON pick that June, and he made an immediate impression by reaching full-season ball in his pro debut after signing for $1.15 million. PERSON was challenged with a move Class A Advanced PERSON in 2017, though, in spite of his fluctuating performance, he still delivered 15 homers and 33 doubles while ranking among the circuit leaders with 81 RBIs (first) and 207 total bases (second). PERSON has impact potential from the left side of the plate, with natural feel to hit and plus raw power that helps him to generate booming home runs and could make him a middle-of-the-order presence in the future. PERSON has the necessary approach to accomplish that, too, though he will need to simplify his approach. Defensively, PERSON is athletic as a third baseman, with hands, footwork and plus-plus arm strength -- one that fired 93-94 mph fastballs as PERSON's closer -- that are ideal for the position. He is an average runner but not a basestealing threat. The ORGANIZATION have long been trying to develop a homegrown third baseman, and while it's early in his career, PERSON, with his across-the-board tools and high offensive ceiling, could be the team's long-term answer.",0
" All PERSON did at FACILITY A&M was perform. He was one of the top hitters in the college game, with a good swing from the left side and the ability to hit line drives to all fields. He'll occasionally show some leverage and loft, but power isn't a huge part of his game. With decent speed, his baserunning instincts allow him to take extra bases and steal some bags. PERSON's arm from the outfield is a plus, the best in the GPE class, and he has decent range. He's played center field during his pro debut in the GPE system, and his offensive skillset profiles better if he can stay there. If it's determined that his range is a bit short, he does have the arm for right, though he doesn't have the power profile usually desired for a corner outfield spot. Wherever PERSON plays, his ability to hit, run, throw and play the game with plus instincts should help him move quickly.Bernie Pleskoff's scouting report Â»",0
"PERSON was the ORGANIZATION of GPE's Friday night starter but the ORGANIZATION immediately moved him to the bullpen after taking him in the sixth round of the 2015 Draft and he promptly led the ORGANIZATION in saves during his pro debut. A jump to the Class A Advanced PERSON didn't deter him in his first full season as the right-hander once again led his league in saves. He kept on closing games succesfully in 2017, reaching Triple-A in the process.Whether PERSON can close at the highest level remains to be seen, but he does have some nasty stuff thrown with a ton of deception. He'll change his arm slots, from high three-quarters down to sidearm, firing fastballs in the 92-96 mph range. He'll throw his slider from all slots and will try to disrupt hitters' timing by hesitating in his leg kick or quick pitching. He does have a changeup that he doesn't use that much, but he misses plenty of bats with his first two offerings. His command is good enough for a short relief role.In all likelihood, PERSON profiles best as a future setup man. If it all continues to click, he could follow a PERSON Cishek-like career path where his stuff and deception lead to a chance to pick up PERSON saves.",0
"GPE's PERSON has challenged for the ORGANIZATION Division I saves lead this spring, but he won't be the first Cornhuskers reliever drafted. PERSON, his set-up man, has the potential for two plus pitches and the possibility of becoming a starter.PERSON pitches to both sides of the plate with a 92-94 mph fastball that peaks at 96 and features some sink. He has a nasty breaking ball that combines slider velocity (81-85 mph) with curveball depth. He also has the makings of an effective changeup, though he doesn't use it much in relief.Because he has three pitches and a clean delivery, PERSON could get a chance at starting in pro ball. He'll need to improve his command but shows some feel for pitching to all four quadrants of the strike zone.",0
"PERSON averaged just 5.0 strikeouts per nine innings in his first two years at ORGANIZATION before changing the grip on his cutter/slider while watching video of PERSON. That sparked a stunning 2017 junior season, during which he threw the first perfect game in GPE history, went 43 straight innings without allowing an earned run and set school records for strikeout rate (11.3) and opponent average (.173). After signing for $901,900 as a second-rounder, he continued to miss bats in five brief pro starts.Hitters don't see the ball well against PERSON, who has a deceptive delivery and generates swings and misses without a true plus pitch. His best offering is his improved cutter, which sits in the upper 80s. He added velocity to his four-seam fastball last year, pitching at 90-93 mph, and also has a decent curveball and a fringy changeup.Going back to his early days in college when he didn't have his weaponized cutter, PERSON challenged hitters and filled the strike zone. He has a strong build and is efficient with his pitch counts, so he should be able to log plenty of innings toward the back of a rotation.",0
"PERSON has some of the best pure stuff in baseball, running his fastball up to 97 mph, flashing a 60 slider at times, and relying heavily on one of the best changeups in the game, which is a 70 for most scouts. His short arm action is a giveaway that he converted from catching while at GPE. The issues holding PERSON back are that he consistently works behind in the count and seems focused on putting up big velo numbers, which affects his fastball command and allows hitters to sit on his offspeed pitches. Like PERSON and PERSON, hope was bright in the past year that PERSON could fix his issues and become a big league contributor, but none of the three have changed much in the interim and now have shorter developmental ropes as they enter their mid-20's.",0
"Another quality PERSON pitching prospect plucked out of GPE ball in a trade, PERSON needed PERSON surgery when the ORGANIZATION set their sights on him in 2013. That didn't stop them from wanting him as the player to be named from the ORGANIZATION in a deal for PERSON, even if he would miss all of the following season. He returned to the mound in June 2015 and made his big league debut 15 months later.PERSON had a mid-80s fastball when he signed for $75,000 out of the ORGANIZATION, and it has gotten stronger as he has. He now operates at 92-96 mph and tops out at 98 while using his 6-foot-7 frame to generate difficult downhill plane. He also throws a power curveball that can range from well above average to slurvy, a decent slider and an improving changeup that shows flashes of becoming a plus offering.PERSON made nice strides in 2016 with his changeup and control, and at this point he mainly needs innings to build consistency. He totaled just 203 1/3 innings in his first six pro seasons, and the 97 he worked last year represented a career high. He missed time in 2016 with elbow tendinitis and a suspension for violating team policy, and he got hit with an 80-game suspension this July after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs.",1
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 4, 2017 - PERSON, Calif.Favorite MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON GuerreroArellano a ORGANIZATION commit who was a 2015 ORGANIZATION and a 2016 ORGANIZATION Second Teamer. The top 500 recruit made four All-Tournament teams in 2015, including with the ORGANIZATION in the 2015 ORGANIZATION World Championship and PERSON in the 2015 ORGANIZATION World Championship. The big, strapping athlete has a high hand stance at the plate and while he shows promise, he needs to shorten his swing to continue to improve at the next level.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the seventh round of the 2012 Draft and went over pick value to sign him away from attending PERSON, they knew the right-hander was a bit of a long-term project as a position player who emerged as a pitching prospect during his senior year of high school. It took until his fourth summer to reach full-season ball, but he's been moving at a steady clip since, heading to Double-A for the 2017 season.PERSON always had a tall and projectable frame and he's grown into it. He throws his fastball in the 90-95 mph range and he's shown an ability to use his 6-foot-5 frame to throw it downhill and get groundball outs. He throws both a curve and a slider, with the former a bit ahead of the latter. His changeup continues to improve the more he throws it. He's generally around the strike zone with all of his pitches.While PERSON has been in pro ball for six years, he might still have some upside while getting close to being ready to knock on the door as a back-half of a rotation type starter.",0
"PERSON hit 96 mph with his fastball as a ORGANIZATION high schooler but blew out his elbow two weeks before the 2015 Draft and had PERSON surgery. He redshirted during his first year at ORGANIZATION, then produced uneven results over the next two seasons while also battling some shoulder issues. The ORGANIZATION signed him for $200,000 as an 11th-rounder last June on the basis of his upside, which was evident during his pro debut and instructional league.PERSON's fastball velocity fluctuated during his final season at ORGANIZATION, dipping to the low 90s at times and topping out at 98 mph at others, and his curveball was similarly inconsistent. As a pro, he worked at 93-98 mph and hit 100 with his heater and spun some well-above-average curves with power and depth. He even showed promise with a changeup he didn't utilize much in college.After battling the strike zone at ORGANIZATION, PERSON displayed better control after GPE cleaned up his lower half in his delivery. He still has a long ways to go to prove he can remain healthy, maintain quality stuff and locate his pitches. While the ORGANIZATION will continue to develop him as a starter, he could move quickly as a reliever.",0
"PERSON ranked as the ORGANIZATION's top position prospect entering 2016 because he offers the best combination of hitting and athletic ability. He should become the highest pick in ORGANIZATION history, surpassing current teammate PERSON, who declined to sign with the ORGANIZATION as the 35th overall choice in 2015. A 33rd-round pick by the ORGANIZATION as an Illinois high schooler in 2013, he broke out as a sophomore last spring and continued to star during the summer, leading the GPE collegiate national team in GPE (.971), extra-base hits (nine) and steals (11). PERSON has a quick left-handed bat and makes consistent hard contact, giving him the potential to hit for both power and average. He uses the entire field well and has done a better job of managing the strike zone and making consistent contact this spring. PERSON has plus speed and knows how to use it well on the bases, and no player this year can match his combination of 39 steals (fourth in the nation) and 15 homers entering the ORGANIZATION Division I playoffs.Though he has spent most of his career at ORGANIZATION in right field, PERSON runs well enough to play center field and should get a chance to play there in pro ball, though some scouts question his instincts. He has the offensive production and arm to profile at all three outfield positions, and obviously he'd offer the most value if he can play in the middle.",0
"Yet another talented ORGANIZATION prospect with deep baseball bloodlines, PERSON is the son of four-time All-Star PERSON and the brother of ORGANIZATION farmhand PERSON, whom the ORGANIZATION took 51st overall back in 2011. While PERSON didn't come off the board quite as early as his brother, his impressive hitting ability still got him an above-slot signing bonus of $1,100,000 as ORGANIZATION's second-round pick. He put on a hitting clinic in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League after signing, batting a robust .427/.451/.732 in 22 games, and then did so once again across two full-season levels in 2017, when he paced all Minor League hitters with a .362 average and captured ORGANIZATION MVP honors. The move up to Double-A in 2018 brought a new challenges for PERSON, though he was anything but overmatched at the more advanced level, earning midseason All-Star honors in the LOCATION as well as his second straight ORGANIZATION All-Star Futures Games selection. PERSON proved an advanced hitter during his amateur career, and his raw power was on display when he won the Under PERSON All-American Game home run derby in GPE. He combines plus bat speed with a violent-but-controlled swing to produce tons of hard contact from line to line, and scouts like his chances of becoming a plus-or-better hitter with above-average power. He's an average runner with good range and instincts at shortstop, and the ORGANIZATION plan to keep him at the position for as long as they can. Some believe he's best suited for second or third base, or perhaps even left field, but so far he's passed every test at his natural position.Much like his teammate and friend PERSON, there seems to be no limit to PERSON's offensive ceiling. His career-to-date points to a bright future as a perennial All-Star who could regularly compete for batting titles.",1
"We assume PERSON was hurt for much of 2018 (he threw just two ORGANIZATION innings) but it's unclear what ailed him. In 2017, he had some wild fluctuations in velocity (he was seen throwing anywhere between 93 and 100, but mostly sitting 94-98), which continued when he threw in 2018. PERSON was 94-96 in the spring and then didn't pitch until late in the summer when he was 92-93. If his arm strength bounces back, he'll move up this list.",0
"A major signing from the 2011 international signing period, PERSON got just over $1 million to sign with the ORGANIZATION out of GPE at age 16. His full-season debut in 2014 was marred by leg injuries that limited him to 49 games and he was held back in extended spring training in 2015 because he was out of shape.While PERSON doesn't have the build of, say, PERSON, he has tools and athleticism to spare. An above-average runner, PERSON uses his speed to cover a lot of ground in center field and he is capable of being a basestealing threat. PERSON has shown an ability to spray line drives to all fields and has a decent approach at the plate, especially given his age. PERSON is unlikely to be a big part of his game, but if his on-base skills continue to improve, that won't be as important as a top-of-the-order type catalyst. PERSON's arm is fringy, but he has all the tools to be an everyday center fielder. Just 20 years old, PERSON did perform well once he got to GPE in the ORGANIZATION State League. Time is on PERSON's side and given the outfield depth in the system, that's not a bad thing.",0
"PERSON signed for $500,000 (late third, early fourth round money) as a fifth round high schooler in 2017. He has a four-pitch mix headlined by a slider/cutter and his 88-92mph fastball plays up because it approaches hitters at a tough angle. He'll likely make his full-season debut in 2019 and projects as a No. 5 starter.",0
"For the second time since the start of 2013, PERSON found himself in a new uniform following the non-waiver PERSON in GPE, this time going from GPE to PERSON in the ORGANIZATION Gomez/Mike Fiers deal. After a strong showing at Double-A between the two clubs, the left-hander was the talk of the ORGANIZATION, where he showcased electric stuff and led the circuit in ORGANIZATION. PERSON built on his ORGANIZATION performance back in Double-A during the first half of the season and reached Triple-A for the first time in his career in June.PERSON's stuff took a major step forward in the ORGANIZATION, where he was consistently 94-98 mph with his fastball and demonstrated improved feel for a plus slider, using it to induce whiffs from hitters on both sides of the plate. He has always featured some crossfire to his delivery, but he added even more deception by shifting to the first-base side of the rubber during the regular season, causing his fastball-slider pairing to play up consistently.Though there's increasingly less concern about PERSON's ability to remain a starter, the southpaw still needs improve his changeup and show he can pound the zone with greater frequency, as he still experiences bouts of wildness. But should starting not work out, there is little doubt that PERSON could make an impact out of the bullpen thanks to his high-octane stuff and huge strikeout potential.",1
"PERSON had an unusual amateur career, graduating early to get to GPE, then not playing much and transferring to a junior college, where the ORGANIZATION drafted the behemoth late in 2015. He is a physical monster with huge raw power, and has a good enough approach to draw walks and pick out pitches he can drive. The bat control, defense, and long-term athletic ability are all behind and concerning, but there's a platoon or bench bat future here if he keeps hitting.",0
"In recent Drafts, the ORGANIZATION had sought out athletic college outfielders, often in the later rounds. Jared PERSON came in the fifth round of the 2015 Draft and, to a lesser extent, there was PERSON from the 2014 Draft. PERSON was the next in line, an eighth-rounder from 2016 out of ORGANIZATION State who had a terrific pro debut and then made it to Double-A in his first full season. The ORGANIZATION liked what they saw there and during his stint in the ORGANIZATION to acquire him from GPE in December's PERSON trade.PERSON has long employed an advanced approach at the plate. He walked more than he struck out in three years of college ball and has a .368 on-base percentage in his ORGANIZATION career, which has helped him to advance quickly. He makes consistent contact and has some extra-base ability. His plus speed is his standout tool and he likes to put it to good use, bunting for hits often and being aggressive on the basepaths. His speed helps him in the outfield, where he can play above-average defense in all three spots. He has the skills to play center field, but he has played in both corners as well thus far as a pro.PERSON is ready to play full-time in the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION system. If he stays with his approach, he could be big league-ready fairly soon, perhaps fitting the profile of an effective fourth outfielder.",0
"C.J. PERSON and his brother, ORGANIZATION PERSON (ORGANIZATION HS in GPE, drafted by the ORGANIZATION), were both drafted lower in 2018 than their talent suggested. PERSON slipped due to demands as an over slot high school pick, while C.J. was old for a junior college player and is limited to a corner, though scouts have some debate about which position is his best fit. C.J. had a big pro debut, getting to High-A and playing in instructs in a season that saw him in real games from late January until October. He has plus raw power and a plus arm, with deceptive contact skills and at least passable defense at all four corner spots. The upside is a low-end regular or the correct side of a corner platoon, which is more likely to happen if he continues to move quickly through the system. His pro ball batted-ball outcomes were lucky but he also played among the longest seasons in all of organized baseball, putting up big numbers at every level.",0
"PERSON was PERSON's guy on last year's list when he profiled as a contact-oriented, multi-positional bench player with no power. At some point in 2018, his hands became more active and his swing took on more movement, becoming whippy and more explosive, and the quality of PERSON' contact was able to improve without costing him much in the way of contact. It culminated in an eye-opening September cup of coffee -- an apt phrase for PERSON, who plays like he is extremely caffeinated --  during which PERSON slashed .293/.349/.483. September numbers can be noisy because the talent pool has been diluted by roster expansion, but we're cautiously optimistic that PERSON has become a different hitter. Namely, a gap-to-gap hitter capable of really punishing pitchers who try to beat him with heat on the inner half. 
Defensively, he's perfectly fine at third base and in the outfield corners, and fringy at second base; we'd rather not have him play shortstop. PERSON's departure should enable PERSON to see big league reps. We think he's a valuable bench option and has a chance to be more than that.",0
"The ORGANIZATION ace was in the conversation to go No. 1 overall in the 2017 PERSON right up until the ORGANIZATION made their selection. Instead, PERSON went No. 5 overall to the ORGANIZATION and he signed for an above-pick value of $7 million. The eighth ORGANIZATION pitcher taken in the first round in the past 10 PERSONs, PERSON pitched sparingly during his pro debut following a long college season, though he competed well in a brief taste of the Class A Advanced PERSON League.PERSON has four pitches, all of which will flash at least better than average, with the ability to throw all of them for strikes. He throws his plus fastball in the 94-98 mph range and can comfortably sit around 95-96 mph, maintaining his velocity deep into starts. He has two distinct breaking balls, with his hard curve a plus pitch that is just a touch ahead of a power slider. His changeup might be a touch behind the other three, but it's a usable weapon and he will throw it at times with above-average deception and movement. While PERSON struggled a little with command during his junior year, he is physical and athletic enough to repeat his delivery and throw more than enough strikes. His combination of size, stuff and projectability point to a future frontline starter, one who should move up the ORGANIZATION ladder quickly.",1
"There's a group of evaluators that believes PERSON is the best teenage prospect on the international market this year. In fact, some rank him ahead of GPE's PERSON, who has been considered the top player in class of 2016 for close to two years.Here's why: PERSON has shown premier polish, poise and instincts on the mound. He's also extremely competitive and has a fastball that has been clocked in the 90-95 mph range. PERSON has been compared to a young PERSON because of the way he approaches hitters and commands his pitches on the mound.Some evaluators believe PERSON could eventually be a No. 1 or No. 2 starter in the big leagues if he continues to develop at a normal pace. While in GPE, PERSON pitched for GPE's 12-and-under team, 15-and-under team and 18-and-under team. He was the ORGANIZATION of the 15-and-under World Cup in GPE in 2014.PERSON left GPE during the winter of 2015 and trains in the ORGANIZATION with PERSON.",1
"The ORGANIZATION were a fun team to check out in 2015 because of the presence of PERSON and PERSON on the staff. PERSON might have more polish, but PERSON's arm strength gives plenty to be excited about.Based on pure velocity, PERSON has a top of the scale fastball, one that hits 99-101 mph and sits consistently north of 95 mph. A lack of movement and below-average command keep it from being an 80 on the scouting scale. The rest of his stuff is raw. His changeup is a bit more consistent than his breaking pitches and he will show an above-average offspeed pitch from time to time. PERSON is working on both a curve and slider, with the former ahead of the latter, an 11-to-5 breaker with good rotation and depth at times. He started to show the ability to throw strikes more consistently with his secondary pitches during his jump to full-season ball in 2016.With room to fill out and get stronger, PERSON could start repeating his delivery more effectively as he matures. He has a long way to go, but a triple-digit fastball is always a good place to start.",1
"It certainly hasn't come easily for PERSON, the ORGANIZATION' first-round pick in 2013. He's hit a bunch of home runs, he's struck out a lot, he's served an 80-game suspension and he's been traded (from the ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION late in 2016). His first full season with PERSON was also his first in Double-A, and it didn't go so well. The ORGANIZATION didn't add him to the 40-man roster, but he was not selected in last December's Rule 5 Draft.While his 2017 season was a disappointment, there were some positive signs, including a reduced strikeout rate and a strong August that saw him hit .316/.393/.481, numbers that perhaps can be used as a springboard. He was adjusting to the ORGANIZATION' approach to hitting, and the organization thinks there's more pure hit tool than he's shown. The raw power is legit, and if he can make more consistent contact, it will show up in games more often.Demerirtte has already shown he can be an excellent defender at second and has more than enough arm for third. He's athletic enough to play the outfield, so the ORGANIZATION might expose him to that in 2018 to help maximize his versatility and value as a power-hitting utility type.",0
"While the ORGANIZATION selected PERSON in the second round out of high school in 2015, his older brother PERSON went undrafted as a prepster two years earlier. He blossomed into a fifth-round choice out of PERSON in 2016, when he shared PERSON pitcher of the year honors. He ascended to Double-A two years after turning pro and pitched well in five starts there before getting shut down with an oblique injury last July, then made 11 starts at that level in 2019 before requiring PERSON surgery.Lambert succeeds by mixing four pitches that all grade from average to solid. He has added some spin and riding action to his fastball, which sits at 91-94 mph and tops out at 96. His 12-to-6 curveball is his most reliable secondary pitch, while his fading changeup helps him against left-handers and he can land his lateral-breaking slider for strikes.Lambert's athleticism helps him repeat his delivery and throw consistent strikes. He doesn't have much margin for error and helps his cause by being stingy with walks and home runs. With some of the best metrics and polish in the FACILITY system, he has a ceiling of a No. 4 starter.",0
"A ORGANIZATION World Series hero who had two successful seasons in GPE's rotation, PERSON quickly pitched his way to Double-A in his first full season after being drafted in the fifth round of the 2015 Draft. The upper level proved to be a challenge for the left-hander, with adjustments needing to be made for him to keep climbing the ORGANIZATION has three pitches he can throw for strikes at any point in the count, though none of them register as above average. His fastball sits around 90 mph, but he'll attack hitters with it. He does a very nice job of mixing in his average slider and changeup to keep hitters off balance. When he's at his best, he gets groundball outs early in counts. When he got to Double-A, he started nibbling around the zone too much, reverting to a college mentality in trying to miss bats too much. He needs to go back to commanding the baseball the way he's capable and not give hitters too much credit.PERSON is not overly physical, and he had two stints on the disabled list with a forearm strain in 2917, so for him to be able remain as a starter, he needs to be more efficient and in the strike zone early in counts. If he can get back to that mindset, he can get back to making it quickly to the big leagues as a No. 4 or 5 starter.",0
"GPE had done nothing but hit since finding his footing as a 19-year-old in the LOCATION League in 2012. He stumbled a bit in his first taste of Triple-A in 2014, but came on strong in the second half and earned his first big league callup in September. In 2013, he split his time between Class A Advanced Clearwater and Double-A Reading, and he led all Phillies PERSON in batting average (.320), home runs (31) and ORGANIZATION (103).GPE's best tool is his power, which he has begun to tap into more as he matures. His quick hands allow him to drive the ball to all fields. GPE is a bottom-of-the-scale runner.Despite GPE's lack of speed, he is a solid defender at third base and has a strong arm. The Phillies have given him some time at first base, but a position change is not necessarily in store for GPE.",1
"While PERSON was overshadowed at the start of 2013 by PERSON, his teammate with Double-A Chattanooga, he built off his strong finish to the '12 season to make a name for himself last season. PERSON played in the 2013 All-Star Futures Game, and his .497 slugging percentage was the best in the LOCATION League.While none of PERSON's tools truly stand out, he has the potential to be a five-tool player. PERSON has a patient approach at the plate and big raw power. He has proven to be vulnerable against left-handed pitching, and he will need to shore up that part of his game. PERSON is a solid runner, and he makes good use of his speed on the basepaths and in the outfield. PERSON has the range to play center field and an arm strong enough for right field, if necessary.PERSON's father, PERSON, got a cup of coffee with the Dodgers in 1985. PERSON should soon surpass his father's career achievements.",1
"One of the best on-mound athletes in the 2018 AZL, PERSON is a converted shortstop with a delivery that looks an awful lot like PERSON's. The ORGANIZATION acquired him on 40-man crunch day from GPE for depth starter, PERSON. PERSON sits only 88-92, but that should tick up as he physically matures. His fastball has natural cut, and at times, he throws what looks like a true cutter in the 84-87 range. He also has a 12-to-6 curveball that flashes plus. 
PERSON could develop in a number of different ways. PERSON could make a concerted effort to alter his release so PERSON is more behind the ball, creating fastball life/rise that would probably play better with his curveball. Alternatively, they might nurture his natural proclivity for cut, and see what happens. Either way, this is an exciting athlete with workable stuff who'll be 19 all summer. He has a chance to start, which is why he's ahead of several other arms on this list who throw harder/are closer.",0
"The ace of a 2012 ORGANIZATION (Calif.) JC juggernaut that also included outfield prospects PERSON (now with the GPE) and PERSON (GPE), PERSON went in the fourth round of the 2012 Draft. He needed PERSON surgery midway through his first full pro season but returned last June and quickly regained his stuff. He missed the first two months of 2015 with a neck injury before returning in mid-June.PERSON's arm strength has been evident since he was a star quarterback in high school. He operates at 92-94 mph with his fastball, tops out at 96 and has heavy sink that elicits a lot of groundballs. His second option is a low-80s slider that's solid at times but flat at others.Refining his changeup will be crucial to PERSON remaining a starter, and he also needs better control. If he can't add enough polish, he could move to the bullpen and possibly turn into a set-up man.",0
"After the ORGANIZATION blew past their international bonus pool and spent $8.2 million in 2013-14 -- and landing elite prospects PERSON and PERSON in the process -- baseball rules prohibited them from spending more than $250,000 on an individual player in the next signing period. They still found an intriguing hitter in GPE, whom they purchased from the GPE Red Devils in December 2014. He had no trouble making the jump to low Class A at age 19 last year, batting .310 while playing steady defense at second base, though shoulder soreness has hampered him in 2017.GPE's hands work at the plate and in the field as well as those of any ORGANIZATION prospect. With his hand-eye coordination and easy left-handed swing, he repeatedly strokes line drives from gap to gap. He's not physical and won't hit for a lot of power, though he does have some sneaky pop to his pull side.GPE profiles best at second base, where he has exceptional polish for a teenager. He has enough arm strength for third base, where GPE plans on giving him some exposure in 2017, and could make for an intriguing catcher. The one aspect of his game that needs refinement is his baserunning, as he has fringy speed and got caught on 11 of his 15 steal attempts a year ago.",0
"We knew nothing of GPE until he threw after the draft, and now we think he's at least a good relief prospect with a chance to be more. PERSON and physical throughout the torso and thighs, GPE has a lightning-quick arm that generates mid-90s velocity at peak. His fastball has bat-missing life, and both his breaking balls have sufficient bite to avoid barrels as well, especially when they're well-located. He was pushed to the ORGANIZATION fairly quickly after signing and carved up the FACILITY in three and four-inning stints. It may be worth trying to start him but he could move pretty quickly as a reliever.",0
"PERSON was a known high school prospect in the GPE suburbs and, though a few teams nearly met it, his price tag pushed him to Tech where he's grown into one of this draft's top talents. He has elite feel for the position, projecting as an impact defender with a 65-grade arm despite being bigger than most good defensive ctachers. He also does advance work for every game, calls area scouts for gameplan input, and is possibly the only catcher at a major program that calls his own games. Scouts rave about his makeup.

Offensively, PERSON has huge power and has hit some tape measure shots, including a ball that went over the football facility roof in left field at ORGANIZATION and still hasnât been found. He isnât the most selective hitter and doesnât have the loosest swing in the class, but he has some feel for the bat head and doesnât have trouble with velocity. His power and fly-ball based approach along with these issues mean he could be a 40 or 45 bat with about an average walk rate and anywhere from 50 to 60 game power. Some of his strikeouts this year were a result of getting pitched around. He's seen a lot of off-speed pitches and has altered his approach to hit what he was facing, which likely wonât be a big issue in pro ball.

Since PERSON is so advanced defensively, some scouts have speculated that heâll go straight to High-A and could debut in the big leagues in late 2019. This could make him one of those prospects that gets to the big leagues before the holes to his offensive game have been closed because he's so good at everything else. The ORGANIZATION have been all over PERSON all spring and are expected to take him 2nd overall, but he's also a candidate to go 1st if PERSON's medical or bonus demands become problematic.",0
"Over the course of his career at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, PERSON served a number of roles, succeeding as a starter as a sophomore then anchoring the bullpen for a team that made it to the ORGANIZATION World Series finals two years later. The jury is still out about which job might suit him best with the Tigers.PERSON certainly has the stuff to start and he threw well in GPE's rotation, particularly in two stellar playoff starts as the ORGANIZATION won the ORGANIZATION title. His fastball and slider are his go-to pitches, both of which are at least a tick above-average. He has a feel for a changeup, though it's a bit behind the other two and he's generally around the strike zone. PERSON had PERSON surgery in 2013 and he missed two months in 2015 with a strained pectoral muscle. Some worry about his durability as a starter.He'll continue developing as one for now to see how it goes. He is an intense competitor with a bulldog mentality that would work well coming out of the bullpen and there's a chance his stuff will play up in relief stints, allowing him to move more quickly through the system.",0
"PERSON has all the catcherly intangibles you can think of and scouts have been wholly unsurprised that GPE has pushed him up the minor league ladder at a speed that might be considered a bit quick since catcher development is typically taken very slowly. He went straight to the ORGANIZATION at age 17, then to a ORGANIZATION packed with 21-year-olds at age 18. PERSON works hard enough that scouts from opposing clubs have taken notice; his leadership qualities have been evident during two postseason runs (circumstances that are helping to drive the 'winning player' narrative here) in two pro seasons. He's a bat-first catcher with some pull power and an above-average arm. He's raw on defense and is already a sturdily built young man who may overthicken and become immobile, but based on the makeup reports it sounds like PERSON will do what is necessary to stay back there. Teen catching prospects are risky. This one seems like a potential everyday backstop if everything breaks right, but it's more likely he becomes a backup.",0
"A mainstay on the high school showcase circuit, PERSON kicked his game up a notch in his senior season opener, reaching 95 mph with his fastball during an 18-strikeout perfect game. He looked like a top-three-rounds pick early in the spring, but his curveball regressed as the ORGANIZATION drew closer, which may knock him down a bit. Though he's committed to ORGANIZATION, he's considered fairly signable for a mid-rounds prepster.PERSON' fastball has parked in the low 90s all spring and he should add more velocity once he adds muscle to his skinny 6-foot-3 frame. He works from an overhand slot that creates downhill plane but not much life on his four-seamer. He has flashed a solid curveball in the past but it devolved into a mid-70s slurve this spring.PERSON has deceptive arm speed and fade with a changeup that may have more upside than his breaking ball. He has a quick arm but also a deep plunge in the back of his delivery that affects the consistency and command of his pitches. He'll continue to develop as a starter whether he turns pro this summer or attends college, though he might deal in the mid-90s as a reliever once he gets stronger.",0
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $135,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2009, two years after his brother, PERSON, made his big league debut. They're entirely different types of players, as PERSON is a speedy utility infielder while PERSON is a power-hitting right fielder. The younger brother hit .288 in the lower Minors before batting .241 in Double-A the past two years, though he did slug a career-best 17 homers in 2015.PERSON started to translate his bat speed and strength into power, but after making consistent contact and peppering the opposite field with line drives at the start of his career, he became pull-happy and saw his strikeout rate rise. He has toned down his approach in 2016 and looks like he might find a happy medium where he could hit .270 with 20 homers per year.PERSON has a strong arm and decent range in right field. He has lost a little speed as he has developed physically but isn't a liability on the bases. PERSON lacks a clear-cut right fielder for the long term, and PERSON could fill that void now that he has found some equilibrium at the plate.",1
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 14, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON Throughout his early high school years, PERSON played two positions (first base and outfield) and thrived as a left-handed pitcher. But moving toward his final year at the high school level, PERSON became primarily a first baseman, leaving pitching on the back burner.While he needs some refining at the plate because of his inconsistent balance, his big frame allows for raw power potential. PERSON has room to grow, and he can develop to fit the first baseman profile.",0
"GPE is a massive third baseman who had the most raw power in the 2019 draft's high school class, but there are significant concerns about his hit tool. Players this size typically move to the outfield, and considering how slow GPE' development might be paced due to the contact issues, he might be out there before he reaches the bigs. He has star-level talent, but is a very risky type of prospect.",0
"A three-year starter at ORGANIZATION, PERSON has probably had his worst season, statistically, in this, his junior season. But the speedy outfielder has shown enough where teams that covet college performers will still have interest in the top five ORGANIZATION's not that PERSON, a two-time Cape Cod League player, has been bad this spring; it's just that he set the bar high by winning the Big GPE's Freshman of the Year in 2016 and then Player of the Year in 2017. He's proven he can really hit, albeit from an unorthodox crouch from the left side of the plate. There is some raw power, but he doesn't tap into it consistently, focusing on line-drive contact and drawing a lot more walks than strikeouts. He's a plus runner who can handle center field with below-average arm strength, one who could one day hit near the top of a big league lineup.Even in his ""down year,"" PERSON has gotten on base at an impressive clip and stolen bases. That skill set, not to mention his track record, has kept him fairly high on GPE boards.",0
"A ORGANIZATION State product who led all Division I pitchers in strikeouts during his junior season in 2015, PERSON continued to use his less-than-eye-popping stuff to find success, pitching across two levels of A ball in his first full season and finishing second in the system in ORGANIZATION, strikeouts and batting average against. He continued to befuddle hitters back in the ORGANIZATION State League in 2017.Upon first glance, hitters likely think PERSON is the kind of pitcher they will light up, largely because of a below-average fastball that doesn't even scrape 90 mph. What he does have is an outstanding curve that he will throw at any time. He can really spin it and will find continued success if he keeps commanding it well. Fear of that pitch and make his fastball seem ""sneaky fast"" and become more effective as a result. He does throw a changeup, though it's not as good as his other pitches. PERSON will have to prove that his stuff will continue to be effective as he moves up the ladder. He's been very effective against lefties, so at worst, he could profile as a specialist if starting doesn't work out.",0
" PERSON was making progress in his climb to GPE, preparing for a trip to the upper levels of the system in 2012, when PERSON surgery wiped out his season completely. He's healthy, and once again, the question can be asked: Is he a starter or reliever? PERSON was a successful college closer, and he's spent a little time in relief as a pro, but the ORGANIZATION always liked his four-pitch mix and what it could look like in a rotation. He has the chance to have four average or better pitches, and he's been able to be around the strike zone with all of them in the past. What PERSON does in the short-term will be medically driven. Being on a set routine as a starter seems more likely, and the organization would like to continue on that path long-term if needed. There's all that pitching at the top of the system, so seeing him develop as a starter but then shortened up into relief when there's a need doesn't seem out of the question.",0
"At ORGANIZATION. 21 overall, PERSON was the second catcher selected in the 2013 Draft, behind only PERSON's Reese ORGANIZATION. The LOCATION prepster has a good understanding of the game, and he adjusted well to the ORGANIZATION Leagues.At the plate, PERSON has an up-the-middle approach, and he produces good bat speed. Big and strong, he has solid power potential.Behind the plate, PERSON isn't afraid to take charge and be a leader. He has a strong arm and has improved his receiving skills, though they still need some work. PERSON is a long way from the big leagues, but he has the tools to become a Major Leaguer in time.",1
"An 18-year-old leviathan, PERSON is much more physical than his listed 180 pounds, and it's shocking to watch him use his instincts and first step to close on balls in center field, even though he likely won't play there for very long. He has exceptional hand-eye coordination and finds all sorts of ways to put the bat head on the ball but too often, he offers at pitcher's pitches and settles for sub-optimal contact. He has a gorgeous, low-ball left-handed swing that could produce power if PERSON learned to attack the right pitches. The near bottom-of-the-scale walk rates each of his first two years are certainly a red flag, but PERSON' size and hitting ability make him an intriguing, high-ceiling flier.",0
"GPE got onto scouts' radar as a prep underclassman and was a classic projection hitter, showing plus speed and defense with a smooth stroke and projection to his frame. As the draft neared and he entered pro ball, GPE added strength and lost a step (though he can still be an average center fielder) but struggled to make offensive adjustments. In the second half of 2018, GPE turned the corner and stopped rolling over on pitches away; he also chose better pitches he could drive. He was also very young for the Hi-A PERSON, which is notoriously pitcher friendly. In 2019, GPE will start the season as a 20-year-old in Double-A ORGANIZATION, which is notoriously hitter-friendly, and sources indicate he's bulked up since the season ended. This, in combination with a more progressive, loft-oriented hitting coordinator, could make now a buy-low opportunity on GPE, even if his numbers will be artificially inflated at ORGANIZATION. There's still a chance for a solid regular here, with fringe-to-average offense and defense in center field, and his age vs. level masks his ability a bit, but we'd like to see what changes are made in 2019 before totally buying in.",0
"GPE has pretty average tools, but he had several years of strong statistical performance in a big conference and plays a premium position. The compact nature of his swing increases the likelihood that he's going to hit, and he also has sneaky strength in his hands that should help him produce at least doubles power. His median outcome is probably that of a second division regular or utility man, if he's better than that it'll be because he hit more than anticipated.",0
"PERSON had his share of suitors coming out of a powerhouse ORGANIZATION high school, but it's hard for teams to pay a big price for a small, high school second basemen, so he matriculated to PERSON. He's been electric there for three years, posting big numbers and maturing physically while fine-tuning his game. 

PERSON was off to a raucous start in 2018 before fracturing his wrist in a benign-looking homeplate collision, scaring some teams that are worried about durability due to his small frame. He missed about two months, but still hit .395/.460/.560 over the course of the year while playing elite defense at second base, especially around the bag. PERSON is a complete, do-everything player once you look past his size and could be in the big leagues as soon as 2019 because of how polished his skillset is. He likely goes 4th to the FACILITY or 5th to the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON is a true 80 runner that doesn't have the hands or consistency to play in the infield long term, so his speed can play in the outfield. He has plus bat speed and a chance to hit 15-18 homers at his peak, but his season was ended by a broken hamate bone and he may be a tough sign in this range.",0
"All PERSON has done anywhere he's played -- from PERSON in GPE to the ORGANIZATION of GPE to his first year-plus of pro ball -- is hit and prove people wrong. He did just that in his first full season in 2014, playing across two levels and earning organizational Player of the Year honors. The numbers in 2015 weren't as impressive, though he still showed a surprising power-speed combination.An undersized outfielder with plus makeup and work ethic, PERSON maximizes the tools he does have. He does have a good approach at the plate with decent bat speed and has shown surprising pop at the plate. He's an average runner, but his instincts allow that to play up on both sides of the ball. The ORGANIZATION have been pleased with how PERSON has looked in center, but he sees time in all three outfield spots. He profiles best as a fourth-outfielder type, but it's never a good idea to limit an overachiever like PERSON.",0
"GPE rounds after the ORGANIZATION went to the ORGANIZATION of GPE to get first-round pick PERSON, they went back to take PERSON, his teammate. It took $600,000 as a 14th-round pick to keep the shortstop from returning for his senior year of college. His pro debut ended with PERSON celebrating a ORGANIZATION championship.PERSON is an athletic college performer, one who can stay at shortstop long term. While he doesn't have a cannon, he has a strong and accurate arm. He makes all the plays, with good hands, solid actions and instincts at the premium position. The bigger question is whether he'll hit. He swung the bat well during his debut, showing the ability to drive the ball the other way and hit the ball where it was pitched. He doesn't have much power to speak of, though he does have a frame that could handle good weight.Nothing PERSON did during his debut said he wouldn't be able to hit, with any added strength a benefit to him competing at the higher levels. How much the offensive side of the game develops will determine what kind of role he might have in the future.",0
"The ORGANIZATION took PERSON out of the GPE high school ranks in 2011 because of his bat, and that's likely what's going to get him to the big leagues.Drafted as a third baseman, the thinking was PERSON would go to first base or a corner outfield spot. He's made enough progress at the hot corner that some feel he might be able to stick there, though he'll never be more than average defensively. PERSON is still going to continue a transition to the outfield that started at instructional league to allow the bat to play. He has legitimate power, with excellent pull home run potential.PERSON may not be a guy who hits third or fourth in a lineup, but he could be a complementary run producer in the fifth or sixth spot, even if he ends up as a first baseman or a designated hitter in the future.",0
"GPE is a well-built, semi-projectable infielder who fits best at second base, though he has played all over the infield. He's an above-average runner with good feel for contact and a good idea of the strike zone. The two-year ORGANIZATION stint is a bit of an indictment, and there will need to be more lift/power in GPE's profile for him to profile at second base, but his frame is such that it has a chance to come. He's more likely to be a multi-positional bench piece than a regular, but there are components present that give Polaco a shot to be the latter. ",0
"One famous player comes to mind when scouts talk about PERSON: PERSON PERSON.The 6-ft-3, 205-pound PERSON is a tall and lanky left-handed hitter and thrower with some raw power. Most see him as a future right fielder, thus the PERSON comparisons.PERSON has a graceful swing, and scouts like his ability to barrel balls up. Evaluators discuss his improving hit tool when talking about PERSON's future.Overall, PERSON has been praised for his ability to hit in games and hit the ball to all fields. He has also shown some power in games and the ability to drive the ball to the opposite field. PERSON describe PERSON as an average runner and say his arm might be a tick above average.PERSON does well in games, and scouts like his makeup. He's been simply described as ""a good baseball player who knows the game,"" on numerous occasions.The outfielder signed with the ORGANIZATION for $2.5 million.",0
"Because of his lack of strength and some delivery concerns, many felt PERSON might end up being better suited for a relief role. But a strong full-season ball debut in 2014, followed by a solid 2015 campaign, has many thinking the GPE GPE right-hander has what it takes to be a starter long-term. PERSON has always had a three-pitch mix, but now he's starting to execute more consistently with all three of the offerings. He'll touch the mid-90s with his fastball and has improved his command of the pitch has improved considerably. His slider has the chance to be another above-average pitch, though he has a tendancy to drop his elbow, causing it to flatten out. His changeup has also gotten better, giving him a third viable option, all coming from a loose arm. If PERSON can continue to add strength, that will further enhance his reputation as a good bet to emerge as a starter. He dealt with the GPEhas to deal with the GPE, but at least that no longer means pitching in ORGANIZATION.",1
"GPE's career took off last season after he got glasses. He's a passable defensive catcher with great contact skills and modest power, which makes him a potential All Star.",1
"Before the ORGANIZATION had seven sandwich picks in 2011, they had three true first rounders. The first two picks turned into PERSON and PERSON. PERSON was pick No. 3. Signing quickly, the ORGANIZATION prepster got a lot of playing time during his summer debut. That made the ORGANIZATION confident to send the hard-working infielder to the full-season ORGANIZATION as a teenager, where he more than held his own. PERSON is quick to the ball at the plate and makes consistent hard contact. He may never be a huge power guy, but there is some extra-base ability and he can turn on the right pitch for some home run pop. He's a solid runner and has the range, hands and arm to stay at shortstop for the long-term.",0
"The 6'5/235 PERSON jumped on the scene last summer in the Cape when he hit 97 with electric stuff in short stints, but with starter traits in longer stints. He had some shoulder soreness this spring along with more 4th starter type stuff, but there could be more upside.",0
"No Alabama high school catcher has gone in the first five rounds of the ORGANIZATION since the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the fifth round in 1998. PERSON played only briefly in the ORGANIZATION, while PERSON has enough promise offensively and defensively to project as a possible regular.Unlike many of the top catching prospects in the 2014 ORGANIZATION, PERSON creates little doubt that he'll be able to stay behind the plate. He has solid arm strength, receives the ball well and is an agile defender. Scouts give him high marks for his leadership skills and competitiveness, as well.PERSON also can do some damage with his bat. He gets good extension with his right-handed swing and will develop more power once he learns to turn on pitches more frequently. For now, he's content to use a gap-to-gap approach that shows good maturity for a high school hitter.",0
"PERSON's older brother PERSON is a big league reliever for the Padres but PERSON was below the radar as an amateur prospect. He was a 40th rounder from high school who went undrafted his first year at a junior college, then was a 7th rounder in his second year. PERSON has done nothing but perform since entering pro ball and scouts have noticed, hanging average or better grades on four of his tools, with power still lagging behind a bit. The likely upside here is a good utility player, but the gap between that and a low-end regular is usually a good swing or approach adjustment. PERSON doesn't have the prettiest swing in the world, but a new hitting coordinator may be able to tease a bit more out of what has already been working so far.",0
PERSON is physical for his age and has some of the class' best present raw power. His wrists whip through the baseball and he extends and rotates beautifully through contact. PERSON's swing has some length and his already strong build raises questions about his physical projection and ultimate defensive home.,0
"PERSON was a raw hitter in high school with advanced defensive skills and, three years later, that's still mostly true. PERSON raked last summer on the GPE, but struggled his first two spring in GPE with the bat, making some progress this spring but not coming close to his dominating summer.",0
"GPE spent three years as a weekend starter for the ORGANIZATION of GPE, earning first-team all-WAC honors as a sophomore. It was an All-Star turn in the ORGANIZATION League the summer after that season that really put him on the map and his strong performance as a junior catapulted him into the fourth round of the 2018 Draft, where he signed for a bit below pick value ($397,500). He didn't pitch the summer after being drafted, but made his professional debut in 2019 in the Class A Advanced California League.GPE's size and stuff attracted amateur scouts and have helped him get off to a solid start against pro hitters. The 6-foot-4 right-hander can touch the mid-90s at times and can sit comfortably in the low 90s. He couples that well with his big 76- to 80-mph curveball that can miss bats and he mixes in a changeup as well. His cutter-like slider might end up being his best secondary pitch in the future, thrown in the upper 80s. He gets a lot of deception with his delivery, with hitters having a hard time picking the ball up out of his hand.The downside of that deceptive delivery is the effort and moving parts that come with it, which have led to control and command problems. With a potential four-pitch mix, he could have a chance to start, and the ORGANIZATION are letting him develop in a rotation. His fastball-breaking ball combination could play up in shorter stints out of the bullpen, however, where his command wouldn't be as much of an issue.",0
"One of the hardest-throwing college starters in the 2014 Draft, GPE became the then-highest pick in GPE history when the ORGANIZATION took him in the seventh round. He struggled as a starter, then began to make progress after becoming a full-time reliever in 2016. When PERSON called him up in GPE, he gave the ORGANIZATION their first big leaguer since PERSON in 1971.GPE topped out at 98 mph in college and currently sits at 94-97 and reaches 100 with run on his fastball. His lack of a reliable secondary pitch handicapped him when he worked out of the rotation, but he since has improved his mid-80s slider and developed an upper-80s splitter to keep hitters off his heater. Both offerings can be solid at times but also are inconsistent.The effort in GPE's delivery also worked against him when he was a starter. While he doesn't have to worry about maintaining his stuff for several innings, his mechanics still hamper his control and command. Without further refinements, his ceiling is likely capped as a seventh-inning reliever.",0
"In his first full season, PERSON led the ORGANIZATION organization in wins, ORGANIZATION and batting average against. It was more of the same in 2016, his second full season, as he topped the system in ORGANIZATION and batting average against, then capped it off with an outstanding performance in the ORGANIZATION. Year three, his first full season in Double-A, has been less consistent.PERSON takes the mound with a lot of confidence, and as much as his results were impressive in the ORGANIZATION, how he carried himself, like he owned the place, stood out even more. His fastball is just average velocity-wise, in the 90-92 mph range, but he commands it extremely well. He has a solid average changeup, but what really has helped him progress has been the development of his curve. It's now a plus pitch he throws with consistent shape for strikes. He has a good sense of sticking to his game plan, mixing his pitches and preparing for each start.Big and strong, PERSON has all the makings of a workhorse starter, one who can pitch in the middle or back of a rotation for a long time.",0
"ORGANIZATION and ORGANIZATION stats are almost meaningless but PERSON's 60-to-25 walk-to-strikeout ratio in 2017 and '18 combined is so exceptional that it almost certainly says something about his plate discipline. That notion is supported by in-person looks at PERSON, who not only has good feel for the strike zone, but also has the hand-eye coordination and bat control to spoil tough pitches, and barrel mistakes. He is very slight of build, so much so that there's skepticism regarding his power projection that there is not for other players of similar age, skill, and level (like PERSON with GPE), who have a better chance of developing pop. 
Excellent at both middle infield spots, PERSON has a shot to be a plus glove at short or second at peak. Even without power, a defensive wizard with high-end feel for contact who runs well is at least a good utility guy. If some pop comes, even if it's just a little, then there's everyday upside here.",0
"Since a 2016 swing change increased the angle in his swing, PERSON has performed at every level until reaching Triple-A in 2018. He's a tweener defensive outfielder with a collection of average tools, and he profiles in a bench/platoon role. He'll likely debut next year.",1
"While PERSON has the arsenal to be a starting pitcher, like he was at ORGANIZATION, a history of injuries and the fact his stuff plays up in shorter stints has sent the left-hander to the bullpen. PERSON missed a month of his summer debut in 2013 with a broken toe, then was able to throw only 13 innings in what was supposed to be his full-season debut a year later because of an elbow issue. When healthy, he has a three-pitch mix he can command fairly well. PERSON will come right at hitters with a fastball he can throw in the 94-96 mph range. His slider is at least above-average and can be a true strikeout pitch in the future. He even has a pretty good feel for a changeup and is adept at pounding the bottom of the strike zone. Now healthy, PERSON has been effective in a relief role in 2015. With his stuff and bulldog mentality playing up in the bullpen, he has the chance to be a poor man's PERSON type short reliever.",0
"Big lefty-hitting 19-year-old GPE has a reported $1.3 million deal with PERSON and he'll likely end up at first base, so the headlining hit/power tools will have to play quickly.",0
"The quick-batted PERSON had a breakout 2018, with a 140 wRC+ during half seasons at Low- and Hi-A. He stands way off the dish, which creates some quality-of-contact limitations on pitches away from him in exchange for an ability to open up and turn on inside pitches with authority. It's an approach that's typically shiftable, but PERSON is also a good bunter and runs well to combat this. Like PERSON ahead of him, it's tough to project corner outfielders with middling power as average or better regulars. PERSON is younger and perhaps has a better shot to grow into more, while PERSON has the superior feel for contact and might end up a 6 bat who doesn't need to hit for power to profile. The two are pretty interchangeable depending on your preference.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON committed to play for the ORGANIZATION after excelling for his PERSON team. A two-sport star, PERSON earned All-State honors in football as a defensive back, as well as All-Southern PERSON All-Stars honors and all-conference accolades on the diamond. The young infielder batted .465 with a slugging percentage over .700 for his high school and has played in numerous showcases. PERSON's arm is his best tool. He doesn't always get his foot down in time at the plate, but the ball jumps off his bat quickly when he makes contact.",0
"A ORGANIZATION high school position player hasn't been selected in the top 100 picks since the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the second round of the 1985 Draft. After starring at the ORGANIZATION in GPE, PERSON could end that drought.PERSON's best tool is his plus-plus speed. It serves him well on the bases and in center field, where he has a better arm than most at the position.The ORGANIZATION recruit has a short left-handed stroke that allows him to make contact, though scouts would like to see him use his lower half more in his swing. He won't hit for a lot of power but does have more than might be expected from someone with his small frame. He'd be better served, however, by hitting more balls on the ground to take advantage of his wheels.",0
"GPE is the young brother of GPE outfielder PERSON and has some similarities to his brother, but is actually more often compared to GPE center fielder PERSON. PERSON and the younger PERSON both have deceptive easy plus speed due to their long frames, a plus arm, plus raw power and the timing issues/long limbs that create contact issues at the plate. PERSON has some track record of hitting over the summer, but some teams this year have been turned off by his rhythmn in the box. There's tons of interest in the 20-40 area and he's already posted big exit velos, so analytical teams are buying into the upside.",1
"The college senior out of GPE will be making his professional debut in 2013 and he's the kind of advanced lefty who could move rather quickly. His fastball sits in the low 90s, but he can reach back for a little more. He has a solid changeup as his most effective secondary option. His breaking ball isn't well-defined, it's part slider, part curve, but it should be an average pitch for him in the future. PERSON isn't the projectable type; he more or less is what he is. And that might be enough to pitch in the back of a big league rotation sooner rather than later.",0
"PERSON shares much in common with PERSON Day, the last Ohio high school prospect with top-three-rounds talent. Both were ultraprojectable right-handers with GPE commitments who wound up with the ORGANIZATION after disappointing senior seasons. PERSON had looked like a potential top-two-rounds choice when he turned in perhaps the best pitching performance at ORGANIZATION's World Wood Bat Association World Championship, an overpowering two-inning stint.At his best, PERSON can unleash 93-96 mph fastballs with armside run. He'll dip into the upper 80s at times, but he should add more velocity and consistency as he puts more muscle on his lanky 6-foot-6 frame. He can flash a plus curveball with 11-to-5 break and a solid changeup with some fade and tumble, though both pitches still need more refinement.For a tall teenage pitcher, PERSON had done a nice job of keeping his delivery in sync before this spring. Both his control and command regressed as he battled cold weather early this spring, and he never consistently found the strike zone. If he does make it to GPE, it's easy to envision him becoming a first-round choice in 2021.",0
"GPE got selected in each of the last three GPE, in the 36th round in both 2014 (by the ORGANIZATION out of high school) and 2015 (by the ORGANIZATION after his freshman season at LOCATION CC) before signing with the ORGANIZATION for $250,000 as a fourth-rounder last summer. In the final year of the LOCATION program, he set school records for batting average (.419) and homers (16) last spring. He continued to mash during his pro debut, topping the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION in runs (63), total bases (161) and ORGANIZATION (1.052) while also impressing GPE with his work ethic.At 6-foot-6 and 225 pounds, GPE is built to hit for power. He's very strong and has a lot of leverage in his right-handed stroke. His long arms can make for an extra-long stroke when he gets too aggressive, so he may not hit for a high average after batting .351 in the ORGANIZATION, but he does show the patience to work walks.GPE moves very well for his size, displaying average speed out of the batter's box and flashing plus speed once he gets going. He divided his pro debut between center field and right field and is a better fit at the latter position. He's still a work in progress defensively but his strong arm is an asset.",0
"The ORGANIZATION made PERSON their second consecutive second round college reliever in 2017 and after his velocity was way down just after his draft, he has since been as advertised. Mid-90s fastball, plus slider, a typical middle relief fit. He's on pace to help the ORGANIZATION bullpen next year.",0
"After a career at ORGANIZATION State spent both starting and relieving, the ORGANIZATION felt they might have a future rotation part on their hands when PERSON dominated the ORGANIZATION and earned a promotion during his first full season of pro ball in 2015. He struggled mightily following that bump up, leaving the organization scratching their heads over this enigmatic prospect.When PERSON stays online with his unorthodox, PERSON Walden-esque delivery, his stuff is pretty good. He throws both a two-seam and four-seam fastball, the former with good sink to get groundball outs, though he throws the latter with good angle. His slider can be an above-average pitch at times, too, though he gets around it and casts it too often. PERSON has a changeup, but it's a distant third pitch. He's a strike-thrower who isn't afraid of contact, especially trusting the life on his fastball and slider.While he's big and strong, PERSON is a little stiff in his core. That, along with that unusual delivery, could mean an eventual move to the bullpen, though the ORGANIZATION will let him continue to start for the time being.",0
"PERSON's father, GPE, hit .288/.397/.436 as a 10-year minor league first baseman, and may have gotten a shot had he played during an era that better appreciated his on base skills, or had he not been blocked by PERSON in '95 and PERSON in '96. PERSON is a totally different baseball entity, standing apart not just from his father but from the rest of the minors, and access to such a unique skillset is partly what motivated the curious Rays to draft him in the second round in 2018. PERSON was ORGANIZATION's two-hole hitter, starting center fielder, and closer. If forced to chose a traditional developmental path, teams would have overwhelmingly preferred PERSON on the mound, where his stuff is commensurate with a typical middle reliever. But PERSON is also a plus-running switch-hitter, with some natural lift as a right-handed hitter and good barrel control as a lefty. The Rays want to take advantage of all of PERSON's skills and asked that he be announced on draft day as a two-way player. At ORGANIZATION, PERSON would often warm up his arm in center field, sometimes very little, before coming in to pitch in save situations. In pro ball, he pitched once every seven days, would have a bullpen day at the midpoint between outings, and either DH or play CF on the other days. Developing as a two-way player is actually less labor intensive than existing as one in college, where PERSON's schedule was more variable. Neither of PERSON's individual roles projects to be one of impact. On the mound he looks like a middle reliever; with the bat he looks like a fourth outfielder. But if he performs like a standard 40-inning reliever, like PERSON, and quintessential fourth outfielder, like PERSON, he'll generate 1.5 to 2 annual WAR, combined.",0
"PERSON has produced since he arrived at ORGANIZATION, starting with winning Big 12 Conference Freshman of the Year honors in 2017. He encored by topping the league in hitting (.392), on-base percentage (.491) and ORGANIZATION (80) while leading the ORGANIZATION to the ORGANIZATION World Series as sophomore, then had a strong summer with PERSON. One of the more well-rounded offensive players in the college ranks, he should join PERSON as the only first-round picks in GPE history.PERSON has a controlled approach at the plate, repeatedly barreling balls to all fields with a sound right-handed swing. The Big 12 Conference co-player of the year, he lets his power come naturally and his bat speed and strength should translate into 25 or more homers per year once he turns on more pitches. He manages the strike zone very well and has no shortcomings in his offensive game.Though PERSON is a below-average runner, he's reasonably athletic and makes enough plays at third base. He has the strong arm required at the hot corner and should be able to stay there. His instincts help him make up for his lack of quickness in the field -- the ORGANIZATION moved him to shortstop in mid-April -- and on the bases.",0
"For the second straight year, the state of ORGANIZATION features one of the top two-sport athletes in the GPE. PERSON can't quite match the tools of PERSON, who turned down PERSON's football and baseball programs when the ORGANIZATION paid him $1.8 million as a second-rounder last summer, but he shows more aptitude at the plate at the same stage of their careers.Whether PERSON can be lured away from the opportunity to double as a running back and outfielder at ORGANIZATION remains to be seen. Unlike many two-sport stars, having his attention divided hasn't prevented him from developing a good swing and learning to make adjustments at the plate. With his bat speed and strength, he's a threat to hit for power as well as average.PERSON's instincts aren't as refined on defense, where he's shaky in center field despite his plus speed. He has improved his arm strength from weak to fringy in the last year.",0
"In a deep crop of talent in GPE, PERSON had been a known commodity, one who participated in summer events like the ORGANIZATION and PERSON. But his name really started rising up boards with consistent performances right out of the gate this spring.Big, strong and physical, PERSON is also a basketball player in high school, as well as a solid hitter. The right-hander throws strikes with a three-pitch mix, pitching mostly off of his fastball, which he'll throw anywhere in the 89-95 mph range. He throws his heater with good angle and plane, keeping it down in the zone. He does show an ability to spin a breaking ball, though he doesn't always stay on top of it, which keeps it from having enough bite at times. He has feel for a changeup, though he doesn't use it much. While he does come across his body a bit, that adds some deception and there's ease in his delivery that points to good command in the future.PERSON's size, stuff and athleticism should interest teams in the top three rounds, and there could be more in the tank as he focuses on pitching only. He is committed to PERSON should he not go the pro route.",0
"ORGANIZATION (Calif.) PERSON featured a pair of prospects who got paid in the later rounds of the 2013 Draft: PERSON, who got $800,000 from the ORGANIZATION in the sixth, and PERSON, who signed for $850,000 with the ORGANIZATION in the 30th. After playing mostly shortstop at ORGANIZATION and the middle infield in his pro debut, PERSON became a full-time catcher in 2014.PERSON has a chance to contribute both offensively and defensively, and he surged at the plate in the second half of 2015, batting .335/.444/.607 with all 13 of his homers and prompting one club official to compare his sweet left-handed swing to that of PERSON. Though the results haven't been there in high Class A this year, PERSON has maintained a quality approach, patiently controlling the strike zone and focusing on using the center of the field. The ORGANIZATION still believe in his power and think he can hit 15 or more homers per season.For someone who shifted behind the plate full-time just two years ago, PERSON is an advanced defender. He has soft hands and moves well, though his receiving skills have slipped this year. PERSON also has solid arm strength, but he needs to improve the accuracy of his throws.",1
" PERSON was a good place to go looking for college shortstops in the 2015 Draft, with ORGANIZATION's PERSON going No. 2 overall to the ORGANIZATION and PERSON, the PERSON-Lafayette product, going to the Reds in the third round, beating alum PERSON by 17 spots as the highest-drafted position player ever from the school.Though he played third and second base in deference to PERSON on the GPE collegiate national team last summer, PERSON is capable of sticking at shortstop in pro ball. He has range to both sides, reliable hands and a strong arm. He tends to flip sidearm throws to first base, however, costing him some zip and accuracy. PERSON has well above-average speed but sometimes gets too power-conscious, which leads to swing and misses and harmless flyouts. He'll need to improve his pitch recognition and learn to tone down his approach to take better advantage of his quickness.",0
"The ORGANIZATION liked PERSON so much that they drafted him twice. He turned them down as a sophomore-eligible in the 31st round in 2015, opting instead to play for the GPE collegiate national team and return to GPE. He signed as a fifth-rounder a year ago and made the jump to high Class A to begin his first full pro season.PERSON has decent tools across the board and profiles as a utilityman more than a regular. He makes consistent contact from the right side, albeit with modest power and on-base skills, so he fits toward the bottom of a batting order. He's an average runner whose instincts help him on the bases and in the field.PERSON played exclusively at shortstop in his pro debut and split time between there and third base in 2017. He has fringy range at short but still manages to make his share of plays, and his solid arm works anywhere in the infield. Given his offensive and defensive capabilities, he fits best at second base.",0
" GPE is one of the youngest players in this year's class and won't be able to sign until he turns 16 in GPE, but that has not stopped scouts from raving about his potential.A physically mature third baseman with soft hands and an accurate plus-arm, GPE is a solid defender with good footwork around the bag. Offensively, GPE shows good bat speed and the ability to hit to all fields. He has displayed large power during batting practice, and it sometimes shows up in games.There is some concern about his ability to recognize pitches and that has swing can get long at times, but some scouts believe GPE is a sleeper and has the potential to be the top player out of this year's crop of prospects. PERSON also like his baseball IQ, his makeup and the notion that he's only going to get better as he grows older.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 28, 2017 - PERSON, Fla.Favorite MLB Team: GPE ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON was a ORGANIZATION Champion in the 2015 16U ORGANIZATION and has made eight All-Tournament teams in four years with numerous different spring and fall travel squads. GPE was also a participant in the 2016 ORGANIZATION and has been awarded with two Honorable Mentions in 2015 and 2016. PERSON note that GPE has high energy for a catcher and he has been called a ""grinder"" type who works and ""loves to get dirty."" Overall, his tools can use more refining, but he has an athletic build and his effort and baseball IQ turns heads on the diamond. He has a potential Major League skillset.",0
"A boiler plate middle relief prospect, PERSON was added to the 40-man this offseason and may debut in 2019. Though he has been developed as a starter to this point, command and repertoire depth limitations have scouts universally projecting PERSON to the bullpen. He has a slightly cross-bodied delivery, and he muscles up and slings in mid-90s fastballs and tilting, two-planed breakers. His changeup is firm, but continued reps in a rotation should help improve his feel for it and better prepare him to deal with left-handed hitters in the big leagues.",1
" Named the ORGANIZATION of the ORGANIZATION in 2013, PERSON continued his strong play the next spring, as he finished second in the country in hitting and led PERSON to PERSON in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON brought an early end to his professional debut, and he underwent surgery to repair a partially torn right labrum in October. He had not returned to the field by the end of July. PERSON is the rare backstop who could have average or better tools across the board. He has a steady, quick swing, enabling him to hit line drives to all fields. He has good raw power, but his swing produces more doubles than home runs. PERSON has elite athleticism for a catcher, and it gives scouts confidence that he will be able to remain behind the plate. He is a good receiver and has the requisite arm strength for a catcher, though his accuracy has room for improvement.",0
"PERSON wasn't a high-profile signing when he turned pro out of the ORGANIZATION in 2011, and his career has taken a while to get going. He repeated the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION in his first two years as a pro and the short-season LOCATION in the last two seasons. He emerged as one of the more intriguing lefties in the ORGANIZATION system in his return to the ORGANIZATION this year, leading the league in GPE (0.51), opponent average (.156) and K/BB ratio (12.3) before his first-ever promotion to full-season ball.In a year in which several of GPE's best southpaw pitching prospects have seen their stuff regress, PERSON has stood out with a lively 91-94 mph fastball that can reach 96. Both of his secondary pitches need more consistency, but his hard slider shows flashes of becoming a plus offering, and his changeup has a chance to become at least average.PERSON has matured significantly on the mound in 2016, doing a better job of challenging hitters and throwing strikes. He's gaining an understanding of sequencing pitches and recognizing swings that he has lacked in the past. Though he still has to prove he can sustain success, the progress he has made this year has been encouraging.",0
"An 11th-round pick out of GPE in 2015 by the ORGANIZATION, PERSON has seen his stuff get better in pro ball, enabling him to make a quick rise through the Minors. He has improved at every stop in his career and was at his best in 2018, when he led all Triple-A ORGANIZATION relievers in opponent average (.181) and finished third in strikeout rate (12.1 per nine innings). He missed the first two months of 2019 with a lat strain, made his big league debut in mid-July, then was designated for assignment and traded to the ORGANIZATION for a player to be named two weeks later.PERSON attacks hitters with a mid-90s fastball that has tickled triple digits in the past. He throws a pair of quality secondary pitches in a power slider that can reach 90 mph with late diving action and a changeup that grades as well above-average at its best. His three-pitch mix makes him effective against lefties and righties alike, though his control and command leave something to be desired.Though the ORGANIZATION assigned PERSON to Triple-A immediately after acquiring him, he quickly factored into their big league bullpen and could become a seventh-inning reliever if he can do a better job of locating his pitches.",0
"PERSON spent 2018 at ORGANIZATION before he was effectively showcased in the ORGANIZATION. He has bat-missing, big league stuff, sitting 92-95 and touching 96 in multi-inning ORGANIZATION appearances, and sitting comfortably in the 95-96 range when he was asked to air it out for a single inning. PERSON also has elite breaking ball spin rates. His 12-6 curveball spins in excess of 3,000 rpm and his firm, upper-80s slider/cutter often approaches that mark, which is rare for a breaking ball that hard. He also has a unique delivery that disorients hitters, during which his arm wraps behind his lower back. His arm action is ugly but, short of a 7-day DL stint this year after he was hit with a comebacker, PERSON hasnât been hurt as a pro. 
His usage has been atypical, however. His starts were often spaced out by seven or eight days in 2018, and itâs unrealistic to expect him to have that kind of recovery time between turns on a big league pitching staff. If asked to throw every fifth day, his stuff may not be as nasty as it was this year. He projects as a No. 4 or 5 starter but may also be deployed in a multi-inning relief role.",0
"While scouts were split on PERSON in terms of playable now tools vs. rawness, he was nonetheless ranked No. 16 on MLBPipeline.com's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list heading into the July 2 signing period. The ORGANIZATION liked what they saw, giving the GPE $1.25 million as part of an aggressive push in the Latin GPE market.Some feel PERSON will be able to help a big league team in a short time, while others feel he looks crude in the field. Some of that has to do with a lack of a true defensive home, with the 21-year-old playing mostly second base and center field, though he did play shortstop in the GPE junior leagues. He has good speed, which gives him good range wherever he plays, though he understandably needs work on his reads and routes in the outfield since he lacks experience out there. Those who watched him in GPE, where he went after leaving GPE, feel he can play up the middle somewhere. PERSON's speed, along with strong instrincts, allows him to be a basestealing threat. At the plate, he has outstanding bat control and an advanced approach. He could have enough power to reach double digits in the home run department.With the investment the ORGANIZATION made, they clearly feel PERSON has the tools to be an everyday player at the big league level. Now it will be up to the player development staff to figure out just where he fits best to maximize his potential.",1
" PERSON is an imposing physical presence in the batter's box and has the body of work to back it up. While injuries derailed his first year in full-season ball, his bat has earned him a place in the ORGANIZATION' next wave of young prospects.  PERSON has a smooth swing that is geared to hitting line drives from gap to gap. He has a good feel for hitting and solid raw power to go with it. As he matures, he may grow into even more power. Originally signed as an outfielder, his below-average arm and speed forced him to move to first base. He's a work in progress there, but has the tools to become an average defender in time.  PERSON earns praise for his makeup and work ethic. He'll need to hit to keep advancing, but that shouldn't be a problem.",1
" The younger brother of PERSON, PERSON is another power-throwing college arm. The ORGANIZATION product was a little tough to evaluate during his junior season as he was shut down at the end of March with a torn lat muscle and didn't pitch again that spring. He did get to throw a few innings as a pro, but some other minor injuries limited him to seven innings. The Twins are excited about his upside and might even give him the chance to start, at least at the outset. At the minimum, PERSON has the two-pitch power arsenal to be very effective in short relief with both a fastball and slider that will be above-average, if not more, in the future. But before figuring out exactly what his future role is, PERSON needs to stay healthy on the mound for an extended period of time.",0
"It might shock you to learn that PERSON's 2018 line of .180/.324/.370 was a hair above the average ORGANIZATION batting line. In high school, he was your standard high risk, high reward corner power projection bat. A monstrous and athletic 6-foot-5 (there's a rumor PERSON offered him a hoops walk-on opportunity in an effort to get him to campus), PERSON drew body and swing comps to PERSON. 
But as he has accumulated statistics in pro ball, he looks much more unique than his profile's bird's eye view would indicate. He strikes out 30% of the time, which is fairly common for prospects like this. But he incredibly only slugged .370 last year while still managing to homer 22 times, and PERSON's ground ball rate is a minuscule 28%. He walked at an encouraging 16% clip last year. Still just 20, PERSON remains a tooled up project with a huge red flag, but now has several underlying statistical traits of interest. He'd be higher on most other teams' prospect lists; we just prefer the ultra-young, up-the-middle guys in this system to a profile like PERSON's, and GPE has lots of those.",0
" PERSON has teamed up with first baseman PERSON in full-season ball to form a powerful infield duo. With PERSON in 2014, PERSON hit 29 home runs and PERSON added 37. Their combined total of 66 homers was the most by a pair of teammates in the ORGANIZATION. Thanks to the bat speed PERSON produces, he has significant raw power and is capable of driving the ball out to all fields. Like many young hitters, his approach is a bit inconsistent, and he can get caught up trying to pull everything. But when he's at his best, he uses the whole field to hit and does a good job of hunting fastballs he can drive. Defensively, PERSON remains a work in progress. He's shown signs he's getting better and dramatically cut down on his errors in 2014. The A's began playing him some at first base for the first time in 2015.",1
"After the ORGANIZATION whiffed on PERSON and PERSON with first-round picks in the 1995 and 1996 Drafts, they didn't take a high school right-hander that early again until 2014. They couldn't resist taking PERSON with the 33rd overall choice and signed him for $1.5 million. He was enjoying a fine first full pro season until he drew a 50-game suspension in mid-July after testing positive for a banned stimulant.PERSON works out of an unusual delivery that features lot of twists and turns and deep tilt in the back. His mechanics and lightning arm speed produce nasty stuff, starting with a fastball that sits in the low 90s, touches 97 mph and figures to get quicker as he fills out his projectable 6-foot-4 frame. When he stays on top of his breaking ball, it combines curveball depth and slider power.PERSON had little need for a changeup as an amateur, so it's very much a work in progress. If his delivery doesn't prevent him from throwing quality strikes, he'll be able to pitch in the front half of a big league rotation.",1
" The ORGANIZATION took a gamble on PERSON in the third round of the 2012 Draft, knowing that his commitment to play football at LOCATION could make him difficult to sign. Though he would ultimately sign for $750,000, PERSON spent most of 2012-14 on the gridiron, eventually transferring to GPE as a defensive back before deciding to play baseball full-time. Despite his time off, PERSON excelled in his first full season, though two separate trips to the disabled list for a knee injury and a concussion, respectively, hindered his progress in 2016. After a strong start to his 2017 campaign with Double-A New Hampshire, PERSON was called up for his big league debut in May, only to suffer a broken hamate bone and land on the disabled list for two months. The injury bug struck PERSON again in GPE Training, with a Grade 2 hamstring strain delaying his start to the 2018 season.PERSON generates good bat speed and makes a lot of hard contact from the right side of the plate. His mature approach and solid pitch recognition translate to plenty of walks and strong on-base skills that fuel his potential as a true top-of-the-order hitter. He has the strength and swing plane to drive the ball out of the park, shows good raw power to center field and could clear more fences as he continues to refine his approach. PERSON's knee injury diminished his speed last season, but he's still a plus, if not better runner capable of impacting games on the bases as well as in center field, where he has plus range but a below-average arm.PERSON didn't receive another crack at the Majors in September because the ORGANIZATION felt it was more important for him to receive guaranteed at-bats in Triple-A while making up for lost time. Meanwhile, PERSON's transformation from a raw athlete into a well-rounded and polished ballplayer in a short amount of time understandably has club officials excited about his bright future.",1
"GPE was up to 96 mph as an 15-year-old amateur, eventually going unsigned on July 2nd due in part to 20 command. Then he hit 100 mph as an amateur with improved feel, which is when the ORGANIZATION scooped him up for $300,000. He was the highest variance player on last year's version of this list and is once again. The pure stuff hasn't change and it's top of the line: a 95-97 mph heater that has hit 101 mph, a power curveball that's anywhere from 60 to 70 depending on the day, and a changeup that flashes 55 or 60 at its best. His command is now a 30 that we project to be a 40. But he's still a teenager, so there's a chance that things click for him and he finds 45 command and 50 control, which would be the minimum to stick as a starter with this kind of stuff. GPE's issues aren't physical -- his delivery is fine and his arm stroke is clean. Instead, the problem appears to be mostly mental. He'll throw well in the bullpen, only to have things will snowball for him in game situations. One source described his issues as stemming from a need for greater mental maturity and to not be so hard on himself, which are exactly the kinds of traits that come with general social maturity. That said, this sort of stuff rarely comes with starter command, so GPE is probably either a high-wire act reliever with bonkers stuff or a starter with the stuff ratcheted down a bit, similar to what PERSON has done the last couple seasons.",0
"Signed for $225,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2013, PERSON' eye-opening GPE debut the following year saw him finish the season as the youngest everyday player in the Class A Short PERSON York-Penn League. He built on that success last year with an equally impressive full-season debut, earning midseason All-Star honors in the LOCATION League before moving up to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON garnered All-Star honors in his return to the circuit in 2017, and he showcased his immense tools to a national audience in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON in July.PERSON showcases all five tools along with elite athleticism on a daily basis. He has ingredients to become a plus hitter from the right side of the plate, with a compact but explosive swing and a present feel for using the whole field. He has juice in his bat but currently lacks in-game power, although that should improve as he matures physically and learns to leverage his swing. PERSON' approach and strike-zone judgment both bely his age, and his tendency to hold his ground in the batter's box resulted in 34 hit-by-pitches last season, second most in the ORGANIZATION. A plus-plus runner, PERSON impacts games with his wheels on the bases as well as in center field, where he has exceptional range and instincts as well as arm strength that's among the best in the ORGANIZATION at the position.The PERSON love PERSON' makeup and work ethic, and it's already made him a clubhouse leader early in his career. He has the athleticism, physical tools and baseball savvy to continue to pass every challenge the organization throws his way. He's a few years away from the Majors, but PERSON is well on his way towards becoming a franchise player.",1
" PERSON signed too late out of the 2011 Draft to play, so he made his professional debut in 2012 and promptly finished eighth in the GPE League in hitting. Itâs his offensive potential that got him an over-slot deal from the ORGANIZATION and he has the chance to be an above-average hitter with above-average power if everything clicks. Itâs the kind of offensive profile that should work at either corner infield spot, as many feel heâll need to move to first eventually. That being said, there are many offensive-minded third basemen in the big leagues who are below-average defenders. Heâll continue to play third for now and let his bat carry him up the ladder.",0
"ORGANIZATION sat out his first year at ORGANIZATION and went homerless in 2013 before starting to turn on the power as a redshirt sophomore in 2014. He went deep nine times that spring and then topped the ORGANIZATION with 20 homers that summer. After spurning the ORGANIZATION as a 38th-round pick, he returned to the Redbirds in 2015 and led the ORGANIZATION with 14 homers before signing for $200,000 as a fourth-rounder. With his strong hands, a quick right-handed stroke and the ability to backspin the ball, ORGANIZATION has above-average raw power and demonstrated it by slugging .516 in his pro debut. He has the potential to hit for some average as well, though he'll have to prove he can make enough contact against upper-level pitching. The big question with ORGANIZATION is where he fits defensively after seeing time at catcher, second base, third base and left field in college. PERSON strength is his best defensive tool, but he lacks quickness and has stiff hands. He started his pro career at third base and could become adequate at the hot corner.",1
"After dominating as a ORGANIZATION State sophomore and leading the ORGANIZATION in strikeouts in 2015, GPE was named the 2016 Mid-American ORGANIZATION of the Year after a spectacular season in which he allowed just three earned runs in his final 12 starts and ultimately led all ORGANIZATION Division I hurlers with a 0.69 ERA, the lowest for a starter at that level since 1979. The ORGANIZATION took him with the 25th overall pick in June, making GPE the first ORGANIZATION starter taken in the first round since PERSON went third overall in 1994.GPE has four effective pitches, three of which project as average or better, and he mixes them well. The left-hander creates good plane on a low-90s fastball that reaches 94 and has natural cutting action, and he's adept at locating it throughout the zone. He pairs it with an above-average slider at 78-83 mph that nets him whiffs with its late slicing action, as well as a solid changeup and a fringy curveball. GPE has crossfire to his delivery, but his athleticism allows him to repeat those mechanics and throw quality strikes, all the while creating significant deception. While he doesn't have a true out pitch or a lofty ceiling, GPE projects as a mid-rotation starter and he may have a higher floor than any lefty in the 2016 Draft.",1
"PERSON broke out in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League in 2014, setting career highs in numerous offensive categories while also making strides behind the plate. While he got off to a slow start last year in his full-season debut at ORGANIZATION A Hagerstown, the GPE native was able to right the ship during the second half and earned a promotion to ORGANIZATION A Advanced Potomac in early September. However, he was unable to build on that success during his return to the ORGANIZATION in 2016.PERSON stands out most for his mature approach and natural hitting ability. He knows how to control the strike zone to his advantage and shows good discipline, while his quick right-handed swing produces loud contact to all fields. He's still learning to tap into his above-average raw power, and scouts believe he'll start to clear more fences as he moves up the ladder.PERSON isn't nearly as advanced defensively, though, and there's some doubt that he can catch in the big leagues. His arm strength is his best asset, one that has helped him throw out nearly 41 percent of would-be basestealers in his career entering 2016, but he'll need to improve his below-average receiving skills to stick behind the plate.",1
" An outstanding athlete who played football in high school, ORGANIZATION gave up the gridiron to focus on the diamond and take a baseball scholarship to GPE. The Indians were able to sign him away from honoring that commitment. ORGANIZATION has some tools, particularly with a bat in his hands. He has excellent bat speed and should grow into plenty of power as he matures. He has above-average speed, but whether he stays in center field remains to be seen â he saw some time in left field as well during his pro debut --  but he could have enough bat to profile just fine at an outfield corner spot.",0
"After helping PERSON to a runner-up finish at the 2016 College World Series, PERSON batted .376 in the ORGANIZATION and would have led the prestigious summer circuit in hitting if he hadn't been a few plate appearances shy of qualifying. He won the Pac-12 Conference batting title (.383) and topped ORGANIZATION Division I with a school-record 30 doubles this spring, establishing himself as one of the best college hitters available in the 2017 PERSON. He signed for a below-slot $700,000 as a supplemental second-round pick gained from the ORGANIZATION as punishment for their hacking scandal.PERSON started to produce more consistently in college when he became more disciplined, working deeper counts and waiting for pitches he could punish. He makes contact almost too easily because it cuts into his walk totals. He's strong and creates plenty of bat speed from the left side of the plate, though he figures to hit more for average than power.While he has an average arm, PERSON lacks speed and quickness, limiting his defensive ability. PERSON used him mostly at first base and ORGANIZATION, while PERSON broke him into pro ball as a left fielder. The ORGANIZATION announced him as a second baseman on PERSON Day and plan to try him there in instructional league.",0
"Initially signed by the ORGANIZATION for $22,500 out of the ORGANIZATION at the end of the 2013-14 international signing period, PERSON was traded to the ORGANIZATION along with right-hander PERSON for PERSON in November 2016. Thirteen months later, GPE shipped him along with PERSON and shortstop ORGANIZATION to the PERSON for PERSON. PERSON pitched in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON during his first season with his third organization but also saw his control and command regress significantly.With a quick arm and little effort, PERSON sits at 95-98 mph with the ability to reach triple digits in the late innings. He has thrown as hard as 103 mph but his velocity is more impressive than his fastball command, and the latter will dictate how quickly he moves up the ladder. He also can miss bats with his power slider and a changeup that's improving as he uses it more.He's similar to fellow PERSON power righties PERSON and PERSON, though scouts are less optimistic about PERSON's ability to harness his stuff. His walk rate jumped from 2.4 per nine innings in 2017 to 6.0 last year. Whether he can develop control, command and consistency will determine whether he becomes a frontline starter or winds up in the bullpen.",0
"GPE went undrafted out of high school and missed most of his sophomore season at FACILITY with a broken wrist, then broke out in the ORGANIZATION in the summer of 2014. He built on that momentum by leading ORGANIZATION Division I in runs (88), hits (108), total bases (188) and slugging (.749), which helped earn him a second-round selection in the ORGANIZATION and a $1.7 million bonus.GPE excels at the plate with a compact left-handed swing, feel for the barrel and advanced approach. He has some raw power, though his stroke is geared more toward line drives.His plus speed makes him a basestealing threat and could allow him to stay in center field, though he played mostly left field in deference to first-rounder PERSON when they broke into pro ball together at short-season Eugene. The only negative in GPE' toolset is his well below-average arm, which rules out right field.",0
"PERSON's development has been a rollercoaster after going in the first round in 2013 out of an Atlanta-area high school. He's always has plus raw power, but his motor, defensive home and in-game contact/power balance have varied year-to-year.",0
"Put simply, PERSON can rake.The outfielder has an above-average hit tool and is one of the most dominant hitters on the market. PERSON also consider him one of the more polished bats in this year's class.PERSON has a graceful swing, and although he doesn't have a ton of raw power, he has a knack for barreling balls. He also doesn't swing and miss very often. What's more, the gap power he displays is expected to improve as he develops.PERSON has an average arm and good instincts on defense. Some believed PERSON would be in the competition for the overall top player in the class, but his run tool has quite literally kept him out of that race. That said, PERSON has shown skills on both sides of the ball, and he shines in games.In other words, he's a gamer.PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION for $1.5 million.",1
"PERSON has a track record of success that stacks up against any high schooler in the 2015 class. He fared well on the showcase circuit as a rising junior in 2013 and did so again in 2014, when he also was the top performer on the GPE pitching staff at the 18-and-under PERSON Championship in GPE in September. He won both his starts, giving up two hits and no runs in 13 innings as PERSON took the gold medal. PERSON had not been as sharp in the early parts of the spring as he was on the summer showcase circuit, perhaps slowed coming straight from basketball season. He was throwing in the 88-92 mph range, rather than up to the 94 mph he was showing in the summer with his heavy fastball. PERSON's tumbling changeup and his feel for pitching are advanced for a prep pitcher. His curveball lags behind his other offerings but should become at least average. PERSON's athleticism does allow him to repeat his delivery and throw strikes easily. He's part of a banner UCLA recruiting class that includes fellow GPE high school pitchers and PERSON and PERSON.",0
"PERSON's ORGANIZATION career has followed a consistent path: PERSON well at one level, get bumped up at the end of the year, figure things out at the new level the next season and move up again. That pattern has allowed the right-hander to go from the New-York PERSON in 2015 up to Double-A in 2017. Just 21 for all of the 2017 season, PERSON is one of the many power relief arms in GPE's system. His fastball is legit, an easy 96-97 mph, touching 99 regularly. His secondary stuff and his command continue to progress. His slider can come and go but should eventually be a Major League-average offering for him. He will drop a changeup on hitters now and again as the ORGANIZATION have stressed to him the importance of changing speeds. He'll get wild at times, but when he's locked in and finding the strike zone, he can be unhittable, and he's found the strike zone more consistently in 2017. PERSON refound his confidence after scuffling post-promotion in 2016. That's been a key to his success, with a future in the back end of a bullpen still very much a possibility.",0
"He didn't put on much of a show during ORGANIZATION's big winter showcase but as we approach extended spring, there's palpable buzz surrounding PERSON, who signed for about $2 million last July. Though heavy-footed when PERSON saw him last February, PERSON has good infield hands and actions, and is a good bet to stay on the middle infield. He has mature feel for contact but his swing is currently pretty conservative, and PERSON likely won't hit for power without an approach or mechanical adjustment. He's a bat-first shortstop prospect and could soon be where PERSON is on this list.",0
"Fully recovered from an elbow injury that knocked him down Draft boards in 2012, PERSON had a sensational first full professional season in '13. Playing across three levels, he hit .312 and led the ORGANIZATION with 84 stolen bases. PERSON followed up with a strong encore in 2014, and he appeared in his first ORGANIZATION Game.PERSON's speed is his best tool, and it grades out at the top of the scale. While speed drives his offensive game, he also has enough power to drive the ball in the gaps.PERSON has good enough range and arm for second base, but he still has work to do defensively. If he can refine his defense, his speed and bat are good enough to take him to the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON had injury issues and moved back and forth from the rotation to the bullpen in college. In the 'pen, sits upper-90s with life and angle. Breaking stuff has nasty, vertical action.",0
"PERSON's 2017 campaign -- 170 strikeouts, 33 walks, 129 innings -- had us wondering if we were missing something and he was an obvious top-100 arm. He carved up the lower levels by making heavy use of two good secondary pitches, a curveball and changeup. He came back down to GPE in 2018, struggling to locate his low-90s fastball in the zone. He sits 90-94, and will touch 96. The long term role may ultimately be in the bullpen, especially since three-pitch relievers may become more necessary due to forthcoming rule changes. He'll likely be up and down this year, making spot starts when needed.",1
"After going 13-0, 0.64 as a sophomore to lead PERSON to the GPE 2-A state championship in 2014, PERSON got off to a similar start last year before injuring his shoulder in May. He missed the rest of the season and didn't have his usual arm strength when he tried to come back at ORGANIZATION's Tournament of PERSON last June. He avoided surgery and has demonstrated early-round talent after returning this spring.PERSON's fastball has fluctuated a bit, dipping to 86-88 mph at times but sitting at 89-91 mph in most outings and peaking at 94 with some armside run. He generates his velocity with a quick arm, using his high three-quarters delivery to create tough downhill plane. He should throw harder as he continues to mature physically.PERSON has good feel for spinning a curveball, though his could use more power, and deploying a changeup. The GPE recruit also shows aptitude for changing speeds and moving the ball around the strike zone, and scouts praise his poise and competitiveness as well. Some clubs still have medical concerns, but he has the upside of a No. 3 starter if he stays healthy.",0
"Signed out of the ORGANIZATION back in 2011, PERSON has always intrigued with his size and arm strength. Pegged for the bullpen very early in his pro career, the big right-hander has the chance to make an impact as a late-inning reliever in the future.PERSON has always thrown hard, with a fastball that typically sits in the mid-90s. He can reach back for something extra and touches 98-99 mph with regularity. He scrapped a curveball for a developing, and more effective, slider and he'll mix in a changeup on occasion to keep hitters honest. Especially for a power arm, PERSON does an excellent job of throwing strikes, though he was more hittable than one would expect when he made his full-season debut in 2014. Some of that could be attributed to the bandbox in GPE, and he made a big step forward as he moved up the ladder in 2015, finishing the year in Double-A, opening some eyes in the ORGANIZATION and earning a spot on the 40-man roster.Giving someone a ""future closer"" label is always dangerous, but if PERSON can continue sharpening his breaking ball to go along with his plus fastball, he has the potential to make that kind of contribution.",1
"The ORGANIZATION spent a franchise-record $74.2 million on bonuses and penalties for their 2014-15 international class, including $63 million in a bonus and tax for PERSON and $8,000 for PERSON. A ORGANIZATION, he didn't reach full-season ball until August 2018 but jumped to Double-A 10 months later. Though he succeeded as a starter in 2018, his small frame led GPE to make him a full-time reliever in 2019.Now that he's working out of the bullpen, PERSON relies primarily on two pitches. He attacks hitters up in the strike zone with a four-seam fastball that sits at 91-94 mph and touches 96, then drops in a low-80s curveball that shows signs of becoming a plus pitch. He didn't exhibit much feel for or trust in his changeup as a starter.PERSON creates deception by hiding the ball well and employing a high arm slot that gives him some downhill angle and helps him stay on top of his curveball. He has mostly pounded the strike zone since coming to the GPE in 2017, though his control wasn't as sharp after he first arrived in Double-A. He could develop into a seventh-inning reliever at the big league level.",0
"PERSON, a former GPE ORGANIZATION star, spent his first full professional season with PERSON. Though he remains somewhat raw, his big arm and prototypical starter's build entice scouts. Having made it up to Double-A in 2015, he clearly intrigued the ORGANIZATION, who got him from the Nationals in return for PERSON just prior to the non-waiver Trading Deadline.There's still some projection left for PERSON, and he could end up pitching with a tick more velocity than he has now. His fastball typically sits in the low 90s, occasionally reaching 96 mph. His secondary stuff is still inconsistent, but he has the makings of a solid curveball and changeup. He's still learning to consistently repeat his delivery, but at his best he fills up the strike zone with all his pitches. PERSON is far from a finished product, but he has the upside to develop into a Major League starter in time.",1
"After a three-year career at GPE, PERSON was taken in the 13th round of the 2015 Draft by the ORGANIZATION and given $500,000 to sign, well above the $100K pick value for selections made after the 10th round. All he has done has hit since then, across two levels of A ball with the ORGANIZATION before getting dealt to the A's in August 2016, then in Double-A with GPE, before getting traded again, this time to GPE Louis this past December.PERSON has shown his approach from the left side of the plate works wherever he's at in the lineup. In his first two-plus seasons of pro ball, he had a .324 average and a .372 on-base percentage, with his .321 average and .379 OBP in 2017 each good for second in the A's system and in the top five for both in the ORGANIZATION. He's walked nearly as much as he's struck out, managing the strike zone extremely well and utilizing excellent bat speed to drive the ball. He even has some surprising power, given his size, with double-digit home runs a possibility in the future. A second baseman only because of his fringy arm strength, he does have solid enough range and hands to profile well there defensively. That, combined with his skill with the bat, point to the kind of overachieving college performer who finds his way into a daily big league lineup in the near future.",0
"Originally recruited by PERSON as a pitcher, PERSON had shoulder surgery before ever throwing a pitch for the ORGANIZATION and became an outfielder. A third-round pick in 2012, he topped ORGANIZATION farmhands with 25 homers in his first full pro season but missed most of 2014 when he needed PERSON surgery in April.Power is PERSON's carrying tool. He has a big, strong frame and drives the ball to all fields. He still has to prove he can handle quality breaking pitches and his propensity to strike out may prevent him from hitting for a high average, but he displayed improved plate discipline before he got hurt last year.A good athlete for a 6-foot-5, 240-pounder, PERSON has close to average speed and moves well in the outfield. He had a plus arm that should bounce back after his elbow reconstruction.",0
"PERSON checked a lot of amateur scouting boxes -- the body, athleticism, stuff, and makeup were all lauded -- and was a model-friendly prospect due to his age, so while issues with fastball command caused some clubs to project him in relief, he was still a clear top two round talent. Perhaps PERSON' control is behind because, as a cold-weather amateur prospect, he hasn't pitched all that much. He only threw around 40 innings during his senior spring, and bad suburban high school hitters in GPE couldn't catch his fastball. As a result, PERSON had little cause to use his changeup during varsity play -- some national evaluators would go whole starts without seeing it -- but it flashed 55 or 60 during his showcase summer and was easy to dream on. 
Perhaps the most striking aspect of PERSON' post-draft performance was how regularly he located his slider down and to his glove side. He has mid-rotation components if you're willing to dream and based on his athleticism, age, and geographic background, we are.",0
"PERSON didn't catch great stuff at ORGANIZATION and it's taken him a little while to het used to receiving pro-quality pitching, but he's improved drastically and looked great in the ORGANIZATION. He now projects as an average receiver with a plus-plus arm. PERSON's swing is simple and makes him tough to strike out while enabling him to tap into some of his strength-driven power. He's a well-rounded catching prospect who should mature into an everyday player.",0
"PERSON is another player on this list who stood out early in his prep career, and ranked near the top of his class as a prep sophomore because he could get into the low-90s with a high-spin breaking ball from a tough arm slot. He slipped to the fifth round in his draft year as some scouts were worried his crossfire delivery was both an injury risk and the underlying reason for his command issues, and would be tough to 'correct.' The injury concerns were mostly accurate, as PERSON had shoulder soreness that led into PERSON surgery in July 2017. He's back on the mound and every indication is that he'll be able to return to his prior form, when he dominated the minor leagues to the tune of 116 strikeouts to 30 walks over 18 appearances before his arm trouble. PERSON gets into the mid-90s with a plus curveball and flashes an average changeup from that tough slot and knows how to use his stuff to elicit chase swings, even though his control is average at best. The ORGANIZATION have no plans to develop him in the bullpen in the short-term, but it seems very possible that his durability and style of pitching may fit best in a Josh Hader-type role.",0
"PERSON played mostly third base on PERSON last summer, while PERSON was at second and PERSON played shortstop. All three project as shortstops in pro ball and they may all go in the first round. PERSON is small and has toned down his swing a bit this spring to focus more on contact, but it's stilla  bit funky, relying more on his standout quickness and instincts in all phases of the game.",0
"While the ORGANIZATION went all-in on high school pitching with their first three selections in the 2016 Draft, they opted to go for college catching with pick No. 4. GPE, a Draft-eligible sophomore from GPE, profiles as a bat-first backstop, though he didn't show much offense during his pro debut in the GPE League.Chalking that up to fatigue and trying to do too much, the ORGANIZATION expected to see GPE's advanced approach from both sides of the plate return during his full-season debut, and it did as he earned a promotion mid-season. He takes pitches and draws walks and should be able to hit for average in the future. He has good bat speed and doesn't miss mistakes when he's locked in, with some home run power as well.There are more questions about GPE's defensive game. He has good hands and a serviceable arm, but he will need work on his footwork, release and game-calling. If that part of his game can develop, GPE could be an offensive-minded regular behind the plate at the big league level.",0
"PERSON signed for $1.45 million as the 24th overall pick in the 2010 Draft, and he looked like the ORGANIZATION' center fielder of the near future when he starred in high Class A in his first full pro season. But he leveled off offensively in Double-A in 2012 and hasn't produced in Triple-A the last two years, and now his outlook is uncertain.The tools are all still there for PERSON to be an everyday center fielder in the big leagues, though it's more realistic to look at him as a fourth outfielder at this point. He still has well above-average speed, which should allow him to hit for average, steal bases and play fine defense. PERSON's quick bat gives him some gap power, and he even has average arm strength.To realize his full potential, PERSON will have to make adjustments. First and foremost, he needs to cut down his swing and adopt a more disciplined approach. PERSON also needs to refine his basestealing technique, as he gets nabbed more often than he should, and he could improve his routes in center as well..",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Southeast 1 - 1/14/17 - PERSON MLB Player: PERSON, a ORGANIZATION State commit, was selected to play in the ORGANIZATION All-American Classic and was named 2015 ORGANIZATION Underclass High Honorable Mention and 2016 ORGANIZATION Underclass Third Team. He helped lead his ORGANIZATION fall travel team to a national championship in 2016 and received a plethora of interest from major schools, including PERSON and ORGANIZATION, among others.Anderson boasts tools both offensively and defensively. He runs well and while he doesn't profile as a power bat, he has quick hands and can drive balls into the gaps. His strong arm and defensive skills give him the chance to man all three outfield spots.",0
"PERSON has been in GPE's system for what seems like an eternity. The ORGANIZATION signed the ORGANIZATION right-hander back in 2011, only to watch him need PERSON surgery and not make his full-season debut until 2017, when he broke out to the tune of a 2.49 ERA while more than doubling his workload from the previous year. He reached Double-A for the first time in June 2018, but struggles during his three starts at the level resulted in a demotion back to Class A Advanced Lakeland. Taking another crack at the Double-A level in '19, PERSON pitched to much better results, with his stuff ticking up across the board. PERSON has shown that he can run his fastball up to 98 mph, but he typically sits more in the low-to-mid 90s with late life. He pairs his heater with an above-average slider that has a high spin rate and nets him whiffs, and he also throws a quality changeup that he sells with his arm speed. PERSON's control and command are below average, and he'll to need to improve as a strike-thrower to remain a starter. PERSON's progress in 2019 has certainly improved his chances of sticking in a starting rotation, though a long-relief or swingman role probably is a more realistic for the right-hander.",0
"Some scouts believe PERSON could be the most advanced hitter from GPE in this year's class, and that's saying a lot.Evaluators like what they have seen so far from PERSON on both sides of the ball, but as with most prospects his age, there is still room for improvement, especially on defense. That said, the teenager has all of the ingredients to become an average catcher in the future, and he is expected to improve on all parts of his game once he signs and enters a team's academy. Some scouts are picturing a young PERSON McCann.There's no disputing PERSON's makeup. He has a high baseball IQ and has exhibited leadership qualities. What's more, PERSON has shown the type of high aptitude and character that evaluators love, and those traits point to a bright future behind the plate.PERSON is from GPE, GPE, and trains with PERSON. The ORGANIZATION are considered the favorite to sign him.",1
"PERSON's reign as PERSON's shortstop came to an end when he required surgery to repair a torn labrum his sophomore year. Though he returned in time for his junior campaign in 2015, PERSON was limited to DH duties during the first half before moving to second base. The GPE made him their fourth-round pick in June, but shut him down until the fall instructional league. He made his pro debut in 2016, earning PERSON All-Star honors at ORGANIZATION A Lake County before advancing to ORGANIZATION A Advanced Lynchburg in late June. After his strong showing with PERSON in the World Baseball ORGANIZATIONic, PERSON has struggled in 2017 with the move up to Double-A. PERSON's bat is his ticket to the ORGANIZATION. He controls the strike zone well and doesn't try to do too much at the plate, utilizing a short, direct swing from both sides of the plate to generate line-drive contact to all fields. While he has some wiry strength to his frame and is capable of hitting the occasional home run, PERSON projects for mostly gap power. His above-average speed fuels his extra-base hit totals and makes him a threat to steal. PERSON's wheels make him a rangy defender at the keystone, where his post-surgery, below-average arm strength is a fit. He does struggle to control his body at times, with footwork that can be inconsistent, but club officials expect him to make gains defensively in his second professional season.",0
"ORGANIZATION PERSON was founded in 2014 in the greater GPE area in the hopes to create a place for high school players to take their games to the next level. It's had four players drafted in the past two years, but only one -- PERSON a fourth-rounder in 2017 -- taken in the top 10 rounds. PERSON left The ORGANIZATION for ORGANIZATION this season and could very well be the next, though a commitment to GPE could stand in the way.Based solely on arm strength, PERSON deserves to be much higher on this list. He's up to 96-97 mph consistently with his fastball and there could be more in the tank with some tweaks to his delivery, though his four-seamer is fairly straight. There's some violence to his delivery, with a short arm action, that impacts his ability to command his heater and his secondary stuff. He throws a power curve which sometimes gets slurvy and morphs into his slider, with some scouts thinking the slider would be a better option given his arm action. He does have a changeup, which can be effective at times, but he never needs to throw it and needs development.Because of his power stuff, delivery and lack of command, some see PERSON as a future reliever, which is a bit of a tough profile for a high schooler. That and what might be a high price tag to keep him from being a ORGANIZATION could send him to college in the fall.",0
"A.J. PERSON might be the more ""famous"" ORGANIZATION of GPE starter, but it's been PERSON who has been the ORGANIZATION' Friday night starter for all three years of his college career. He's more about pitchability than stuff, but that's led to a ton of success in the ultra-competitive SEC.Strong and durable, PERSON is a strike-throwing machine with a potential three-pitch mix. He typically works with an average fastball velocity-wise, but it plays up because of his command. His best pitch is his changeup, which he locates and sinks extremely well. Even when hitters know it's coming, he still gets outs. PERSON's breaking ball is slurvy and a bit inconsistent. When it's on, it can be virtually unhittable and has the potential of being a third Major League average offering.The lack of an explosive fastball limits his ceiling and, as a result, his ORGANIZATION stock. There's no question PERSON is the first Gator pitcher to go off the board and some others could pass PERSON by because of the fastball, but whatever team takes PERSON will be getting a college performer who should be quick to the big leagues as a back-end starter.",0
"Having developed several pitchers drafted as high schoolers, the Pirates know that patience is of the utmost importance. So there was no panic when PERSON, who was given an over-pick value deal to sign in 2014 instead of head to GPE, started his career slowly. He didn't pitch much in 2015 because of injuries, most notably a forearm strain, but he made a huge leap forward during a healthy 2016, finishing the year with some stellar playoff starts and helping PERSON win the ORGANIZATION State League title.PERSON's fastball keeps on getting better, now sitting in the low-to-mid-90s, with the ability to reach back for more. There's a ton of sink to it and that, along with his improved changeup, elicits ground-ball outs. His 11-to-5 curve is his best secondary pitch, and he misses plenty of bats with that and his heater. PERSON beyond his years, PERSON has vastly improved his ability to harness his stuff and fill the strike zone with all of his pitches.PERSON had to deal with another injury, this time a back strain, in 2017, but is still very much poised to join the group of elite-level pitching prospects in the game. Still very much projectable, he now looks like he could be a frontline starter if he reaches his ceiling.",1
"Entering 2015, PERSON had played in three different leagues since being drafted in 2012. In each -- the GPE, GPE and PERSON leagues -- he led or tied for the lead in home runs. PERSON, obviously, is what evaluators would call PERSON's carrying tool. He has as much power potential as anyone in the ORGANIZATION system not named PERSON. He's also struck out in over 25 percent of his plate appearances as a pro, and therein lies the rub. How will PERSON continue to tap into that prodigious raw power if he can't make enough contact? It remains to be seen, though he hit for power even with the move to Double-A in 2015. PERSON continues to work on his outfield play as well, with room for growth as a right fielder as he improves his footwork on his throws. In the end, it will all come down to his bat. If he can hit enough, he'll find a place to play. If he can learn to make just enough contact, he has the chance to continue vying for home run titles in any league he plays in.",0
"The best pitching prospect out of GPE and the top hurler overall in this year's class, PERSON is smart and fearless on the mound. Evaluators believe he can be a top-of-the-rotation type of pitcher if he stays healthy and continues to develop his tools at a normal pace. He projects to have average or above-average tools across the board and he's already considered advanced for his age.The teenager's best pitch is his fastball, but he also projects to feature a good curveball and an above-average changeup. He already shows good command and feel for his pitches and the mix results in a lot of swing-and-misses. PERSON is still growing, and the hope is that he will increase the velocity and overall command of his fastball with age. Back in February, PERSON mixed all of his pitches to strike out five of the six batters he faced at the ORGANIZATION in GPE, GPE. He did walk a batter, but more importantly, he showed a plus fastball and emerging secondary pitches.PERSON is from PERSON, GPE, and trains with PERSON. The Cubs are the favorite to sign him.",0
"The ORGANIZATION are no strangers to being aggressive on the international market, particularly when GPE players become available. They jumped at the chance to sign PERSON, who was No. 4 on ORGANIZATION's Top 30 ORGANIZATION list when he got $4.75 million from the ORGANIZATION to sign. After impressing early with his bullpen sessions and showing initial polish similar to fellow PERSON, the right-hander appeared to get away from his strengths during a rocky first pro season in 2017.The 2018 season was a nice step forward for PERSON. He did a good job of finding his delivery, which enabled him to stay on top of the ball better and created a better angle. As a result, he had better action on his pitches and a more consistent break on his curveball, which lost its sharpness when he would get under or on the side of the ball. But he wasn't able to repeat that success in 2019.An improved tempo also increased PERSON's ability to pound the strike zone in 2018, though his walk rate spiked the following season.. With a three-pitch mix that gives him a good chance to start, PERSON's fastball touches as high as 97-98 mph. If he can get back to what led to his success in '18 and continues to refine his pitches, he might not be far from reaching the big leagues.",0
"PERSON was rotation mates with PERSON at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, and he was drafted about 300 picks after the ORGANIZATION' ace in 2011. PERSON earns praise for his makeup and smarts, traits that helped earn him the ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION Class Award in 2011.PERSON's fastball peaks at 91 mph, with sinking action. His slider and changeup give him two more average offerings. Though PERSON's stuff isn't overwhelming, he has found a way to be successful as a professional.The key to PERSON's success is his control, competitiveness and feel for pitching. He does a good job keeping the ball down in the zone and maintaining his stuff deep into games. PERSON will have to rely on his command and pitchability to reach the ORGANIZATION as a back-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"PERSON was an eligible sophomore last year and went late, but went in the second round this year after a loud spring as a 22-year-old. He may not have a 60 tool but is a solid player with a fierce beard/mullet combo.",0
"PERSON and his teammates from PERSON in GPE spent more than a month in the GPE playing against top high school teams from GPE earlier this year. There's a real possibility the young infielder will get a chance to see a lot more of the country in the near future.A legitimate shortstop prospect, PERSON has the tools to stay at the position as he develops. What's more, some scouts think he has the potential to be above average in every facet of the game, except for power. That said, there's the belief that PERSON could still hit at least 10 home runs when he gains strength. He can also spray the ball to all fields.Scouts view PERSON as a good defender with solid fundamentals, and they compare him to PERSON infield prospect Hak-Ju Lee. PERSON has been scouted heavily by the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON led the LOCATION Conference with 11 wins as a redshirt junior at FACILITY in 2016, when he was one of 16 college pitchers drafted by GPE in the first 20 rounds. He has exceeded expectations since signing for $180,000 as an 11th-rounder, posting a 2.12 ERA in his first two seasons. The ORGANIZATION eased him into pro ball as a reliever and he continued to thrive after they turned him loose as a starter in high Class A last June.PERSON might have the best fastball command in the system, enhancing the effectiveness of a 91-94 mph fastball that reaches 96. He has improved his curveball since turning pro, giving him a solid second pitch. His changeup is more of a work in progress but there are games when it works as well as his curve.After initially looking like he might advance quickly as a bullpen piece, PERSON now is a potential back-of-the-rotation starter. He's not overly physical but keeps his pitch counts down, allowing him to work deep into games. Out of nowhere, he has become one of GPE's most advanced starting-pitching prospects.",0
"The 2016 Draft for the ORGANIZATION will likely always be known for the big arms they took at the top: PERSON, PERSON and PERSON. PERSON might seem like the fourth musketeer for now, but the fourth-rounder who got $1.2 million to sign instead of going to the ORGANIZATION of GPE has pitching tools that should not be ignored.A football player in high school, PERSON brings a bulldog mentality to the mound. He goes right after hitters with what eventually could be a solid three-pitch mix, though it's inconsistent at present. His fastball sits in the 92-94 mph range, but he can reach back for a few more ticks of velocity at times. His slider is slurvy, but he had made some adjustments to his long arm action to tighten it up under pro tutelage. PERSON didn't throw his changeup much in high school, but there are the makings of a usable offspeed pitch in there. He does do a good job of throwing strikes with all three pitches.PERSON is strong and durable, not your typical tall and lanky high schooler, so there isn't a ton of projection to him. Some amateur scouts saw a future reliever in him, but he'll begin his ORGANIZATION career in earnest as a starter and see where it takes him.",1
"The D-backs have had their fair share of pitching prospects coming from the first round of the GPE, with PERSON and PERSON leading the way. They may have found another potential starter a bit later, nabbing PERSON in the 15th round of the 2015 GPE after he had a solid year as ORGANIZATION's Friday night starter.A PERSON All-Star during his first full season in 2016, PERSON earned a promotion to the GPE League in early July. With a three-pitch mix and an ability to throw strikes, he should be able to stay in a rotation long-term. The right-hander will touch 94 mph with his fastball, and he throws it with heavy sink, using his 6-foot-6 frame well. He mixes in a solid slider in the mid 80s and has a usable changeup as well. While he doesn't miss a ton of bats, he gets groundball outs and doesn't hurt himself with walks.PERSON's ceiling may be that of a back-end starter, one who is durable and can log innings. Finding that in the 15th round will certainly be a feather in the scouting department's cap if it all comes together.",0
"Though PERSON has one of the best arms and bodies among high school pitchers in the GPE, teams believe it will be virtually impossible to divert him from playing at ORGANIZATION. His father PERSON played with current head coach PERSON at ORGANIZATION in 1995, and PERSON gave the Cornhuskers a verbal commitment as a sophomore. Based on talent alone, he could crack the first five rounds.PERSON' fastball velocity fluctuated with the weather during an unusually cold spring, as he would pitch at 87-92 mph on some days and 91-95 on others, holding it deeper into games once it warmed up. He has some feel to spin a curveball with some power and depth, though it lacks consistency. He can throw his changeup for strikes but needs to refine it further.PERSON has a long, lanky frame with plenty of projection remaining. He's athletic and does a nice job of maintaining his three-quarters arm slot. If it doesn't happen this year, he could be an early-round choice in 2021 after three years of adding polish at ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON GPE has had five outfielders selected in the top three rounds of the past six GPE, and PERSON should go in the same territory in June. A semi-regular as a freshman and a left fielder in deference to gifted defender PERSON on the ORGANIZATION' 2015 College World Series team, he's the center fielder and offensive catalyst on their '16 squad.PERSON is well suited to bat atop a lineup, as he has a patient contact-oriented approach and the plus speed and know-how to steal bases. His flat left-handed swing doesn't yield much power, but his on-base skills rank among the best in college baseball. PERSON has performed well during two summers in the ORGANIZATION League.Though he hadn't played much center field for ORGANIZATION before this spring, PERSON's speed and instincts make him at least a solid defender there. His arm strength is below average, but it isn't considered a liability.",1
" PERSON was considered by many to be one of the top prospects in the 2012 Draft but he fell to the Pirates at ORGANIZATION. 8 for a variety of reasons. He eventually chose not to sign and returned to Stanford for his senior season. He was once again considered among the top prospects in 2013 and the ORGANIZATION didn't pass him up a second time, selecting the PERSON native first overall. PERSON is a complete package as a pitcher, combining stuff, size and pitchability. He mixes his mid- to upper-90s fastball with a good slider and changeup, giving him a chance for three plus offerings. One of the knocks on him in 2012 was his lack of strikeouts, but he improved on that as a senior and now misses plenty of bats. PERSON profiles as a top of the rotation starter and could reach PERSON in a hurry.",0
"PERSON was raw and lanky when PERSON signed him as an 18-year-old out of GPE in 2009. It took him some time to figure things out on the mound, and the ORGANIZATION were rewarded for their patience, as he took a big step forward in 2014, earning a spot on the World team at the ORGANIZATION XM All-Star PERSON Game.PERSON stands out the most for his powerful fastball, which has been clocked up to 100 mph and typically sits in the mid-90s. He combines it with a sharp hard slider that is an above-average offering at its best.Like many tall pitchers, it has taken PERSON some time to smooth out his delivery. He still likely will never pitch with great control, but his stuff is good enough to make him effective at the back of a bullpen.",0
"Teams who like premium athletes currently playing premium positions will certainly give PERSON a long look and his stock was rising quickly as the GPE approached.His best tool is his speed and he has plenty of it as a guy who should be a basestealing threat in the future. He makes solid contact, putting the ball in play and letting his legs work for him, even showing some power to the pull side on occasion. He has shown some difficulty hitting the breaking ball.Whether he can stay at shortstop remains to be seen, though he has decent range and a serviceable arm. But teams won't hesitate to draft him and then move him, a la PERSON, down the road.",1
"PERSON began his college career at GPE (GPE) JC in 2014 before transferring to GPE, where he suffered serious head injuries and needed subsequent gall bladder surgery after his car was rear-ended in a high-speed accident. He pitched just 33 2/3 innings in two years with the ORGANIZATION, then won ORGANIZATION pitcher of the year honors in the summer of 2016 and transferred to LOCATION A&M. He led ORGANIZATION II in strikeouts (165) and strikeout rate (15.9 per nine innings) before becoming the highest pick in GPE history, signing for $125,000 as a 13th-rounder.PERSON has continued to miss bats at an exceptional rate since turning pro, doing so with basically one pitch. He challenges hitters with a 91-97 mph fastball that seems to rise at the plate. He throws over the top, a la PERSON, and opponents have trouble picking up his heater because it seems to come straight out of his ear.Whether PERSON can survive on fastballs alone at higher levels remains to be seen. He also has a curveball that gets 12-6 break from his delivery but arrives in the low 70s, and he's fiddling with a changeup that has a long ways to go. He battles the strike zone but has gotten away with it so far because his heater has been unhittable.",0
Switch-hitting infielder with medium build. Is more polish/feel to hit than tools/projection.,1
"A heady high school infielder from the ORGANIZATION, PERSON really jumped on the map when he made ORGANIZATION's 18 and under national team as an underclassman in 2017. PERSON during the 2018 Tournament of PERSON carried over to the rest of his summer, but he used those difficulties to motivate him to return to a level of consistency during his senior year in Washington.When PERSON is going well, he can do a little bit of everything well, even if he doesn't have a carrying tool that jumps off the page. The switch-hitter can drive balls in the gaps and can stay inside the ball and go the other way when needed while showing good command of the strike zone. There's bat speed and he could eventually approach average power when he physically matures. PERSON runs well and has excellent instincts, both on the basepaths and defensively, where he is a natural leader. He has the hands, actions and arm to play shortstop, though some think second base might be his long-term home. He's also athletic enough to handle the outfield if need be.PERSON gets as high marks for his feel for the game and intelligence as he does for his tools. Whether he gets drafted early enough to forego his commitment to ORGANIZATION remains to be seen.",0
"The ORGANIZATION bucked the industry consensus by taking high school infielders PERSON and PERSON with their first two choices in the 2013 Draft. While PERSON has hit well, PERSON hasn't found consistent offensive success. The son of longtime college assistant and current GPE State coach PERSON, PERSON has the strength and loft in his left-handed swing that are conducive to hitting for power. But he has ordinary bat speed and an undisciplined approach, which may limit the damage he can do.There's more pressure on PERSON' bat now that he's a full-time third baseman. The ORGANIZATION tried him a shortstop last year, but he made 13 errors in 34 games and his below-average speed and quickness weren't a good fit. He has the arm strength to make all the throws from third and to possibly consider a career on the mound if hitting doesn't work out.",1
"Â PERSON was largely overlooked as an undersized high school right-hander in 2011, but the ORGANIZATION liked him enough to take a chance on him in the 26th round. He has pitched well at the outset of his professional career, posting a top-10 ERA in his league in each of his first two Minor League seasons.PERSON doesn't have overwhelming stuff, but all of his pitches play up thanks to his polish and above-average command. His fastball sits around 90 mph, with some projectability remaining. PERSON' fading changeup is his best pitch and he gets good depth on his curveball.PERSON earns comparisons to PERSON for his physique and overall skill set. Like PERSON, PERSON profiles as a back-of-the-rotation starter.",1
"PERSON jumped on the radar with a strong summer showcase circuit showing at a number of events. When he came out this spring even better, with more velocity, he made a huge leap to near the top of many Draft boards.With a projectable 6-foot-6 frame, there was always the thought that there might be more in PERSON's tank in the future. Evidently, the future is now. He has been as lights out as any prep arm in the country, coming out of the gate up to 98 mph and touching 96-97 mph in just about every start and easily sits 92-94 mph. He has one of the best breaking balls in the class, a power curve that is now a mid-80s hammer. While his changeup is behind right now, and he occasionally slows his arm down, he has feel for it and it should be a solid pitch in the future.While some have expressed mild concern with a deep arm action in the back, PERSON has shown he can fill up the strike zone with two current plus pitches. The ORGANIZATION has moved into the top of the first round conversation, with some thinking he would be a candidate to go 1-1 if it weren't for the fact a high school right-hander has never been taken with the top pick.",0
"Every ORGANIZATION class has what's known as ""pop-up"" guys, players who may not have registered over the summer or even early in the spring, but then take a leap forward performance-wise, sending scouts scurrying to see them and driving them up ORGANIZATION boards. PERSON was the perfect example of that in GPE as a spike in velocity raised his profile considerably.Early on, the big right-hander had been throwing in the 87-91 mph range. He first jumped on the radar when he lit up the radar to 92-96 mph, and sat mostly 94-96 in a two-inning relief stint against powerhouse ORGANIZATION. That put him on a must-see list and when more than 50 scouts arrived to see him throw against lefty standout PERSON, his stuff was just as good. He currently throws a hybrid breaking ball that gets stuck in between a slider and curveball, but looks more like the latter with some bite when it's on. PERSON will mix in an occasional changeup, but it's far behind the other two pitches. He stays around the strike zone and should have average control and command in the future.PERSON's size and arm strength -- he'll show a 70-grade fastball at times -- kept scouts pouring in as the ORGANIZATION approached. His ability to put together multiple strong outings has moved him into top-three-round consideration.Prospect Development PERSON - PERSON, GPE.",0
"GPE looked the part of a future first-rounder during his first season and a half at GPE before blowing out his elbow and requiring PERSON surgery in mid-2015. After sitting out all of 2016 and then turning down GPE as a 21st-round pick, GPE resuscitated his prospect status with the ORGANIZATION and became GPE's second-round pick in 2017. In his first full season, GPE garnered PERSON of the Year honors in the Class A Advanced PERSON, going 11-0 with a 2.69 ERA in 16 games (15 starts) at ORGANIZATION before advancing to Double-A. He was named the organization's co-PERSON of the Year with PERSON's elbow reconstruction has had little impact on his velocity, as he spent 2018 pitching at 91-95 mph with a four-seam fastball that stands out for its high spin rate. His above-average curveball also features an impressive spin rate, which in turn gives it power and depth. His changeup arguably is his best secondary pitch, earning above-average grades from evaluators, and he also has feel for mixing in a slider.GPE wore down during the second half of his first full season, which prompted the Nationals to shut him down until fall instructional league. Big and physical, he should be able to handle a greater workload once he builds up the necessary strength. Improving his pitch usage and command are the next steps for GPE, who has the size, stuff and feel to develop into a No. 4 or 5 starter.",0
"PERSON had a velocity jump during his draft spring and has had some issues in the two years since dialing in his arm speed and refining his delivery. His velo has varied a bit, but when he's on, he'll work 92-94, hit 97 mph, flash an above-average breaking ball, and have the look of a potenial league-average -- or a bit better -- starter. Other days, he's just a big guy with a clean arm, some velocity, and little else. He's further along in the search for starter traits than lefty PERSON is, but you can lump them in the same group as talented young arms that need to show consistency.",0
"PERSON is polarizing, in that some clubs don't like his low slot and high back elbow, while others see a cleaner delivery, better command and a more projectable frame than PERSON's former travel ball teammate, PERSON.",0
"Signed out of GPE in January 2013, PERSON impressed during his GPE debut in 2015, earning PERSON MVP honors, and then followed it in '16 by winning the GPE League batting title with a .362 average. Following the season, the ORGANIZATION added PERSON to their system when they selected him with the ORGANIZATION. 3 pick in December's Rule 5 Draft.PERSON stands out because of his very good feel for hitting. He has a solid approach at the plate and makes consistent hard contact that allowed him to win batting titles in back-to-back seasons. PERSON has good speed and is a basestealing threat. He's added some strength and there could be some more extra-base pop in time. His quickness gives him range defensively, and scouts feel he has the aptitude to stick at shortstop while also being able to handle moving around the infield if needed in the future.PERSON has yet to play at a full-season level, but the ORGANIZATION deemed him advanced enough to gamble on him in the Rule 5 Draft. PERSON will tell whether he can stick on the big league roster for the full season.",1
"PERSON's heavy sinker earned him a $150,000 bonus as a 15th-round pick out of PERSON (Ill.) PERSON in 2011. He has added velocity since then, reached Double-A in his second full pro season and topped the ORGANIZATION with 144 strikeouts in 2014. PERSON now works at 91-95 mph and touches 97 with his fastball and backs it up with a hard curveball that gives him a second plus pitch at times. His slider has its moments as well, while his changeup is more of a work in progress. He generally does a good job of throwing strikes and using his 6-foot-4 frame to leverage his pitches down in the zone. If PERSON can refine his changeup and his command, he could help the ORGANIZATION as a starter. If not, he could make for a late-innings bullpen weapon. His fastball could tick up further in shorter stints, and he could just focus on throwing it and his slider.",0
" As the 2017 college season got underway, PERSON was regarded as perhaps the top college bat in the country. Two-way sensation PERSON ended up going ORGANIZATION. 4 overall, but PERSON's .342/.427/.570 line, not to mention his 38 walks and just 12 strikeouts, landed him at ORGANIZATION. 7 overall, one pick ahead of his GPE teammate PERSON. PERSON, who signed for full pick value of just over $5 million, ended his junior season with more home runs (13) than strikeouts. He's always had that advanced approach at the plate but started showing more over-the-fence power despite playing in a pitching-friendly home park. He can drive the ball to all fields, with extra-base ability to spare. A below-average runner, PERSON is likely limited to first base, where he is a good defender with a solid arm. While that puts pressure on his offense to profile at the infield corner, it looks like PERSON should be able to do it well as a pro, with the chance to be above-average with his hit and power tools.",0
"Back from a 2017 ACL tear, PERSON hit for characteristically high rates of contact in 2018. He's a career .328 hitter in the minors and has carried high averages to the upper levels, as he now has about half a season of Double-A at-bats under his belt. The type of contact PERSON makes is unique. He employs a punchy, minimalist swing, and just kind of throws the bat head at the baseball, leading to lots of opposite field contact. It's worked so far, and PERSON has hit for enough contact to outweigh the total lack of game power that results from this kind of approach. It's unlikely that this is an PERSONn situation where all of a sudden there's power, because PERSON was pulling the ball in the minors. 
Mostly because his actions are quite good, PERSON fits fine at second base. He's a thicker guy and has begun to see more time at other positions (mostly other infield spots), and versatility will enable a team to roster PERSON even if the lack of power turns out to be a problem. He likely projects as a bat-first utility guy, but there's a chance he makes sufficient contact to be a regular at second.",1
"It's not often an undrafted free-agent signing makes it onto a prospect list, especially at the very start of his career, but PERSON is an unusual case. PERSON didn't take him in the 2012 Draft because of a ORGANIZATION commitment, but the D-backs were able to sign him after he threw well that summer. He didn't make his organizational debut until this summer, but there's a lot to like with his arm strength and projection. He has the chance to have three pitches he'll throw for strikes, in his fastball, curve and changeup, even if it takes a while for it to all come together.",0
"People who watch PERSON hit might do a little bit of a double-take. The LOCATION high school standout purposefully has patterned his approach, setup and swing after PERSON. A veteran of ORGANIZATION USA, PERSON has shown an ability to catch some of the better prep arms in the country, grading out with solid catch and throw skills. He has an idea at the plate with some good power from the right side to go along with it. And though there's not much projection and he'll have to watch his conditioning, he should have enough to be an everyday backstop at the next level.In addition to his ORGANIZATION work in summers past, he has led his Mater Dei team to two straight ORGANIZATION Invitational championships. That tournament is also held at ORGANIZATION's complex, making PERSON, GPE PERSON' home away from home.",0
"GPE ORGANIZATION might get more of the attention in terms of high-end PERSON talent, but the northern part of the state should not be ignored. GPE, a projectable right-hander from GPE, is helping to make sure that doesn't happen.GPE's fastball velocity has fluctuated at times this spring, but has mostly been in the 88-91 mph range, occasionally touching 92 mph. He tends to get stronger as the game goes on and has room for added strength, leaving many to believe there's more in the tank to come. GPE has a really good curveball, thrown with depth and bite when he stays on top of it. The ORGANIZATION State PERSON commit has a very good feel for his changeup, giving him three future average or better offerings. He generally stays around the plate, though his overall command, like with many high school pitchers, can improve.Joe ORGANIZATION might be the first prep pitcher from GPE to come off the board, but a team that believes in GPE's ceiling might take him not much later.",0
"After two nondescript years at ORGANIZATION, PERSON jumped on the radar with a strong junior season, building off an All-Star campaign in the ORGANIZATION League the previous summer. The top college prospect in GPE in the 2017 Draft class, he was taken by the ORGANIZATION in the fourth round and given a slightly above-pick value bonus to sign. Pitching in relief in the short-season ORGANIZATION York-Penn League during his debut, PERSON struck out 12.8 per nine innings, then followed it up with a solid first full year in the LOCATION, once again striking out better than 10 per nine.With a quick arm and a strong frame, PERSON can run his fastball up to 96 mph and sit at 93-94 and while his velocity had dipped after heavy use in his last college season, he proved durable and effective over his first full season, finishing with 131 innings pitched. He's fiddled with different versions of a breaking ball in the past, but now features a hard slider/cutter that has good, late life. PERSON can spin a curveball with good depth and has aptitude for throwing a changeup. His fastball, slider and changeup all can be plus pitches at their best, so he has the ingredients to start. In order to succeed in that role as he moves up the ORGANIZATION' ladder, he will have to continue to refine his overall control and command (3.7 BB/9 through 2018).",0
" There were few prospects in all of the ORGANIZATION Leagues who broke out more than PERSON did in 2012. The speedy center fielder topped the system in stolen bases and finished second in a host of other offensive categories. He has the chance to be a true five-tooler on the field. With a long, lean frame, heâs an aggressive swinger who started to learn the values of plate discipline, making him a much more dangerous hitter. He should hit for average and at least a little power. His plus speed will make him a long-term basestealing threat and an outstanding defensive outfielder.",1
"The grandson of former big league catcher PERSON, PERSON caught the eye of scouts by pitching well in the ORGANIZATION during the summer of 2015 and as a junior at FACILITY's (Calif.) the following spring. He did little to distinguish himself in his first two pro seasons after signing for $75,000 as a 14th-rounder in 2016, but he broke out and led all Minor League left-handers with 171 strikeouts in 135 1/3 innings last year. He has been even more effective in 2019 while jumping from Double-A to the big leagues.PERSON works at 90-93 mph and touches 95 mph with his fastball, which he can work to either side of the plate. It generates a surprising amount of swings and misses because its high spin rate creates the illusion that it rises. His slider also misses bats and serves as is his best secondary pitch, followed by his changeup and curveball.PERSON has some deception in his delivery that throws off hitters' timing, though he sometimes battles the strike zone as well. He has enjoyed more success against left-handers than right-handers, and he should have a floor as at least a situational reliever. But he continues to thrive as a starter and could get an opportunity in GPE's rotation before too long.",1

His heater comes in at 85-87 mph with arm-side run, and while the 70-mph curve currently lacks bite, he has feel for his 81-mph changeup. The hurler has a medium frame and a solid build and can mix pitches well.",0
"A litany of off-field issues dominate every discussion about PERSON, who can't seem to get out of his own way. A fist fight with a teammate ended a college career marred by various other infractions and inconsistent physical conditioning. PERSON's stuff was really good -- he'd bump 96 and flash two plus secondaries -- and he probably would have gone early in the first round of the 2017 draft had he not been a makeup powder keg, but he fell to pick 25, where GPE decided his talent was worth the gamble. PERSON was sent home during his first pro spring training for repeated curfew violations. He came back in July and made six starts, then was shut down. He was back up in mid-August for a single start, then was shut down again and needed PERSON, which he had at the end of August. The timing of the injury means PERSON may not pitch until 2020, when he'll be 24. There's a chance he pitches in GPE next fall or perhaps in the ORGANIZATION, but if not, he'll just be a 40 on our lists until we see that the stuff is back.",0
"Like his fellow countryman PERSON, PERSON received a seven-figure bonus when the ORGANIZATION singed him out of GPE in July 2012. PERSON also made his professional debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2013 and held his own as a 17-year-old. He throws his fastball in the low 90s and mixes it with a changeup and curveball. His changeup is his best offspeed offering, though his curveball is improving. PERSON is athletic for his size and has shown the ability to make necessary adjustments already in his career. His loose, easy delivery should allow him to command all of his pitches well as he gets more experience on the mound.",1
"GPE PERSON outside of GPE has had a fair share of drafted prospects, most notably outfielder PERSON, a second rounder in 2011 currently with the FACILITY. PERSON was an interesting left-handed pitching prospect at the school, albeit one without much present stuff, taken in the 36th round in 2016. Three years of pitching at FACILITY later, topped off by an outstanding junior season as the ORGANIZATION' Friday night starter, have moved him firmly into the Day 2 picture.While PERSON still doesn't have wow stuff, he does throw harder than his high school days and has shown a very good feel for pitching. His fastball typically sits in the low-90s, but hitters don't see it because PERSON uses his 6-foot-7 frame well to create deception and gets excellent extension so his average heater gets on hitters in a hurry. With good movement up in the zone, he gets a lot of strikeouts with his fastball above the bat. His best secondary pitch is his changeup and he sells it well. His slider is fringy, but he mixes it in effectively.PERSON has done an outstanding job of throwing quality strikes as ORGANIZATION's ace and all of his stuff plays up because of his ability to command the ball, his size and the deception in his delivery. His ceiling is somewhat limited, but he has the chance to move quickly as a No. 4 or 5 type starter.",0

He never seemed to be able to get back on track at ORGANIZATION A Advanced Lancaster. PERSON's struggles are difficult to explain, because his stuff hasn't taken a step back from what he showed at ORGANIZATION.

"PERSON GPE has sent 11 pitchers to the big leagues since the turn of the century, and PERSON is talented enough to add to that total. An unheralded recruit out of GPE (Mo.) High, where he broke a 45-year-old career scoring record in basketball, he earned a spot in the GPE rotation at the outset of his freshman season. He led the ORGANIZATION with in strikeouts (106) as a sophomore and is on course to do so again in 2018.PERSON lacks consistency, with the quality of his pitches and even more with his command, but when he's on he can can display stuff worth of a late first-round selection. He can pitch at 92-94 mph with a fastball that has reached 98 mph and features some run and sink, and he can back it up with a sharp mid-80s slider. But there also are times when his heater and slider lose some power and flatten out.PERSON has yet to show much feel for a changeup and also possesses a curveball that isn't as reliable as his slider. He starts slow with his delivery before speeding up his tempo, which leads to him getting out of sync and struggling to locate his pitches. While he has been a durable in college and will get the chance to develop as a starter in pro ball, his ultimate role may be as a high-leverage reliever.",0

He has also won three ORGANIZATION championships.Hauver makes quality contact at the plate. He is developing power thanks to his solid build. As he prepares to make contact, the infielder has an even stance and uses a leg lift as a trigger, following the motion with a loose, compact swing.Hauver reads defensive hops properly in the field. His feet work in sync, and he has average arm strength for his position.",0
"After PERSON came out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE and dominated both in his pro debut and in the ORGANIZATION in 2014, he looked poised to get to GPE in a hurry. His trip was delayed when he scuffled with a move to Double-A in 2015, though he righted the ship with a bounce-back 2016 season that saw him reach Triple-A for the first time. However, his progress was slowed by a shoulder strain that forced him out for the first two months of the 2017 season.With renewed confidence and a more streamlined delivery that was consistently online, PERSON had better results. His velocity ticked upward, sitting consistently in the 94-96 mph range and thrown with good movement to get ground-ball outs. His slider also improved and he continues to refine it. He actually has shown glimpses of a decent changeup, but he doesn't use it enough. His command got better, thanks to his online delivery. He can still get under the ball at times with too much of a low-3/4 slot, which impacts both his command and the quality of his pitches.Hard-throwing right-handed relievers are becoming a depth position for the ORGANIZATION farm system and PERSON once again looks like he belongs in the group that will help out in GPE soon.",0
"PERSON's fastball has taken off in the last couple of years. He pitched at 89-91 mph when the turned down the ORGANIZATION as a 29th-round pick out of a GPE high school in 2011, then sat at 91-93 as a freshman at GPE (Wash.) CC the next spring. He has refined his delivery since signing for $100,000 as a 12th-rounder in 2012, and his heater now has climbed into the upper 90s and topped triple digits.PERSON backs up his fastball with a hard slider and even shows some feel for a changeup. He still needs to improve his control and command, though he does a good job of keeping the ball down in the strike zone.After reaching low Class A in his first full year as a pro, PERSON could be ready to move quickly after dominant showings in the ORGANIZATION and PERSON leagues during the offseason. He's strictly a reliever but could develop into a late-inning option.",1
"PERSON's first full professional season saw him start the All-Star Game for the GPE League before moving up to Double-A Pensacola for the second half. After his breakout year, the ORGANIZATION traded him to the Phillies in exchange for PERSON. None of PERSON's pitches jump off the page, but he does have four of them that he can throw for strikes. His fastball can touch 93-94 mph, and his slider shows signs of being a potential above-average pitch, as well. PERSON mixes in his curve and changeup well to keep hitters guessing. All of his stuff plays up because of his unusual delivery in which his arm stays hidden, making it tough for hitters to pick up the ball.  When he was a member of the ORGANIZATION' system, PERSON was often compared to PERSON for his stuff and deception. It didn't take long for PERSON to get to the big leagues and PERSON could be on a similar track.",0
"PERSON has among the most impressive tools in the draft with the pure speed to comfortably project in center field as well as big raw power and arm strength. He's sushi raw and has struggled to hit, even against mediocre pitching as this spring has progressed, but he's also one of the class' youngest players and some orgs are projecting heavily on the bat because of PERSON' combination of youth and athleticism.",0
"When 'pitchability' is one of the first words a scout uses to describe a teenager, we don't generally expect that teenager to also throw in the mid-90s. But such is the case with PERSON, who has a remarkable early-career ability to manipulate the shape of a fastball that touches 96. He can cut it, sink it, use variations in sequence together, and has feel for dumping in first-pitch curveballs for strikes. PERSON is still a lanky teenager who has problems repeating his delivery, so while he has obvious on-mound creativity, he doesn't always execute, and his ability to locate needs to develop. Aside from the fastball, PERSON's stuff is, or projects to be, close to average, and his likely long-term fit is at the back of a rotation. As soon as his command starts to improve, he'll be capable of carving up the lower levels by mixing in all these pitches, and if it happens in 2019, he could end the year with Low-A Charleston.",0
"A Draft-eligible sophomore out of GPE when the ORGANIZATION took him in the ORGANIZATION B in 2016, GPE cemented his profile as a bat-first backstop with a solid first full season that saw him play across two levels of A ball. After reaching Double-A for the first time, the ORGANIZATION dealt him with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION Deadline.GPE has shown that his power will play. That's especially true from the left side of the plate, where his pop is at least average and he's hit the majority of his home runs as a pro, though he has 45 power from the right side as well. There is some swing and miss, and he's never going to hit for more than average, but he's also willing to be selective in waiting for a pitch to drive, with the ultimate goal of lifting the ball in the air.GPE is less advanced defensively, but he has made progress and worked hard behind the plate. After throwing out roughly 22 percent of attempted basestealers in his first full season, he pushed that number up to 40 percent in 2018. He'll never wow anyone back there, but there is confidence he'll be capable enough to stay there. That gives him the chance to be a switch-hitting, offensive-minded big league regular catcher with power.",0
"GPE and physical, PERSON has an exciting combination of speed and power, as well as promising ball/strike recognition. What he appears to lack at this point is barrel control and a bat path that enables the power. Those are important components and may not be easy to fix, especially the bat control issue. But PERSON's ball/strike and breaking ball recognition could help mitigate those issues, and his ceiling (a high ORGANIZATION center fielder with power) is lofty if they're overcome. A max-effort player with a fairly mature build, PERSON seems poised to have a strong statistical summer against ORGANIZATION pitching and defenses, perhaps enough that he'll see some LOCATION time late in the year.",0
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON away from being a two-sport star at FACILITY A&M in 2013 and while he threw well during his full-season debut, a shoulder issue caused a drop in velocity and shut him down for most of the last six weeks of the season. PERSON and rehab appear to have righted the ship.PERSON has the upside of a future frontline starter. He'll throw his fastball up to 96 mph with good movement. His slider is his best secondary pitch, a power breaking ball thrown in the 84-86 mph range that can be an effective out pitch. PERSON also throws a curve and a changeup, both of which show signs of being PERSON average. PERSON brings a football-like competitiveness to the mound and while his walk rate went up in 2015, he's generally around the zone. Managing his Type 1 PERSON does not appear like it will be an issue. Aside from making sure the shoulder stays sound, the only concern surrounding PERSON is that he didn't miss as many bats as you'd expect, given his pure stuff. Still just 20 years old, there's time for him to learn how to use that stuff to his advantage more consistently.",1
" | Overall:45PERSON and his outstanding defensive skills have now twice been included in trades. The first was the 10-player deal that sent him from GPE to GPE in July 2012. Just over two years later, in November 2014, PERSON was sent, along with right-hander PERSON, to the ORGANIZATION in return for PERSON Conger.A very solid defensive receiver, PERSON moves well behind the plate, with good footwork, a quick release and a strong arm that has allowed him to throw out 33 percent of would-be basestealers throughout his career. His glove has carried him through the ORGANIZATION and it's what should get him to the big leagues soon. He's not completely lost at the plate, with a line-drive stroke, a little gap power and a tendency to make contact.Right now, he profiles best as a solid, glove-first, big league backup. If the bat can develop, he has the chance to be a defensive-minded regular down the road.",0
" PERSON has made steady improvement since signing out of GPE as a 17-year-old in 2010. He made a big jump in 2013 when he reached Double-A Bowie, and then finished the year as the starting pitcher in the ORGANIZATION championship game. The ORGANIZATION used him as trade bait at the 2014 Deadline, sending him to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON Miller.Initially more of a command-and-control lefty, PERSON has grown into his lanky frame and has seen his velocity jump as a result. He now throws his fastball in the low 90s, with good sink and movement. PERSON pairs his fastball with a hard changeup and a tight slider, both of which grade out as at least average offerings.PERSON wasn't quite as sharp in 2014, but at 21 years old, he's young for Double-A, and he still profiles as a possible middle-of-the rotation starter.",1
"After a solid first full professional season in 2013, PERSON exploded in 2014. He dominated the ORGANIZATION in the first half of the season for Double-A Arkansas and was included in the package the PERSON sent to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for PERSON just after the All-Star break. PERSON made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in September, but his ORGANIZATION career was short-lived. In December, he was traded again, this time to the A's as a part of the deal that sent PERSON to GPE Diego.PERSON is all power on the mound. His fastball sits around 95 mph and can edge higher on the radar gun. After struggling to throw his curveball for strikes, PERSON replaced it with a slider that has quickly become a solid offering. He also occasionally mixes in a changeup.The PERSON didn't use PERSON much as a closer, but he has the stuff to pitch high-leverage innings. After getting his first taste of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON should soon be ready for a more regular role at that level.",1
"The ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON in the 38th round of the 2016 Draft after he had a strong redshirt sophomore season, but he opted to return to ORGANIZATION. It turned out to be a wise move, as PERSON was the LOCATION player of the year and hit himself up to the ORGANIZATION. 35 overall pick, where the ORGANIZATION finally got their man to sign for full pick value.PERSON hit well with wood bats in summer leagues several times over, so a transition to the pro game shouldn't be too tough. His offensive game rose to a new level this spring when he adjusted his swing, used his lower half more and quickened his right-handed stroke. He showed an ability to get to his power more consistently, with improved plate discipline another contributing factor.PERSON runs better than you'd think given his size, with average run times out of the box and more once he gets going. He played first at ORGANIZATION, but he had played the outfield previously and the ORGANIZATION sent him out to start his pro career in left field.",0
"Though PERSON had a track record of success and offered some of the best pitchability among high school pitchers in the 2015 Draft, his lack of physicality and a big-time fastball enabled the ORGANIZATION to get him in the second round. Since signing for $1,495,000, he thrived as a youngster in tough pitching environments in each of his first three pro seasons. The youngest ORGANIZATION qualifier in the GPE League by nearly a year at age 20 in 2017, he ranked fourth in the high Class A circuit at 4.17 despite pitching in GPE, possibly the best hitter's park in the Minors.PERSON shows the potential for four pitches that could be at least solid. His fastball sits at 92-94 mph and peaks at 96, and he keeps it off barrels with sink, angle and very good command. His tumbling changeup may be his most consistent plus pitch, though his low-80s curveball can be even better than that at times.Last year, PERSON added a slider that can reach the mid-80s and continues to improve as he throws it more. He repeats his clean delivery with efficiency and uses his high three-quarters arm slot to pound the bottom of the strike zone. He looks like a future No. 3 starter and perhaps more if he can get stronger and add more velocity.",1
"If you wanted to see the very top of the D-backs' 2017 Draft class during their summer debuts, GPE in the short-season LOCATION was the place to go as first-rounder PERSON and ORGANIZATION B pick PERSON joined PERSON, the second-round pick out of PERSON, in a formidable lineup. PERSON got off to a good start, but tailed off in the second half.PERSON was teammates with ORGANIZATION. 4 overall pick PERSON, but it was PERSON who led PERSON in batting average, home runs and ORGANIZATION in 2017. He has the chance to hit for average and power and did so in the beginning of his debut before he struggled. He has easy raw power to all fields and has shown some feel to hit. He managed his strikeouts for the most part in college, drawing walks, and that carried over in GPE before he started to press and got out of his approach. Coming out of school, there were concerns about his defense, with some thinking he'd eventually move to first, but the D-backs were pleasantly surprised with how he handled the hot corner and don't have concerns about his future there.For PERSON to reach his potential as a power-hitting third baseman, he'll have to make sure he makes enough contact to tap into that power. The D-backs don't think there will be carry-over from his fade at the end of 2017 in his first full pro season.",0
"GPE and toolsy, PERSON originally signed with the ORGANIZATION as a 17-year-old in 2005. He quickly proved to be an all-out performer in all facets of the game, but he has struggled to stay healthy since having two knee surgeries in 2011. PERSON was never able to truly break through in the ORGANIZATION outfield and was non-tendered in 2013. He signed with the GPE, where he will try to turn his promise into production. With quick hands, PERSON makes a lot of contact, but he also swings at just about everything. He doesn't strike out much, but he doesn't walk much, either. He has excellent speed that works on the basepaths and in the outfield. He has played center but profiles better in right field. He also has raw power that he's still learning how to use. PERSON has played in the ORGANIZATION in each of the past two years and could soon return there in GPE.",1
"After being the consensus best catcher in the 2015 Draft class, PERSON went No. 11 overall and performed well in his pro debut. He needed a mulligan for his first full season, however, as a concussion, and then a wrist injury, kept him off the field and from important development time for much of the year. He was making strides in return to action in 2017 when a thumb ligament injury ended his season in July.The good news is that the ORGANIZATION high school product is still only 20 years old and he hasn't lost any of the tools that made him a first-round pick. At the plate, he has shown good on-base skills and can drive the ball to all fields. There should be more power to come as he grows into his 6-foot-4 frame. That is not the ideal size for a backstop, but PERSON does have arm strength and agility, especially for his size. He will need to continue to work on his footwork and to quicken his release. He spent a lot of time with former big league catcher PERSON in 2016 and was able to learn a lot about the mental side of catching, even when he was out of action.It looked like PERSON was starting to show why he was so highly coveted in the 2015 Draft class when the injury bug hit again. He'll have to try to hit another reset button in 2018.",0
"PERSON showed glimpses of talent at ORGANIZATION (Mo.) High and got drafted by the Royals in the 33rd round in 2016, but no one envisioned him blossoming into potentially PERSON's first position-player first-rounder ever. He fouled a ball off his right foot and broke it last spring, costing him the final two months of his sophomore season and all of last summer. He has the best all-around tools in the 2019 college crop, though a rough spring in LOCATION play leaves his Draft status somewhat uncertain.PERSON's bat speed, strength and the leverage in his 6-foot-4 frame give him huge raw power that he's just beginning to tap into. He's a polished hitter with a sound left-handed swing, good balance and a mature approach that had him leading ORGANIZATION Division I in walks when he got hurt in 2018. He also has plus speed and the aptitude to steal bases, making him a 20-20 threat.After playing mostly left field as a freshman and a lot of first base as a sophomore, PERSON has looked comfortable in center field this spring. He has the quickness and strong arm to patrol anywhere in the outfield, with a chance to stick in center in pro ball and the tools to profile well in right. PERSON love his makeup as well.",0
"After signing for $2.475 million as the 12th overall pick in the 2012 Draft, PERSON reached high Class A and performed well as an 18-year-old at the end of his pro debut. He returned to that level in '13, and his season couldn't have gone any worse -- he ranked last in the ORGANIZATION in hitting (.178) and first in strikeouts (160 in just 383 at-bats). Back at Winston-Salem again in 2014, PERSON has regrouped and looked much better at the plate.A year ago, the FACILITY thought PERSON got too focused on trying to race to the big leagues. In 2014, he showed better balance, pitch recognition and strike-zone discipline. PERSON will still pile up some strikeouts and may never hit for a high average, but he should be able to tap into his considerable raw power.PERSON has the best all-around tools in the system, though that won't mean much if he can't make consistent contact at the plate. His power, speed and arm strength all grade as above average, and he plays a solid center field. PERSON 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds, PERSON projects to move to right field once he fills out.",0
"PERSON is a late-blooming power arm who took a step forward stuff-wise in 2018, but didn't take a step forward statistically until he was put in the bullpen for the last month of the season in the short-season GPE. After the full-time shift, PERSON threw 16.2 IP with 19 K and 3 BB. It's not as simple as you may think, with most of those relief outings going multiple innings, so it seemed to be more of a mental adjustment than being better in short stints, with some sources telling us his confidence increased in that role. PERSON will turn 22 in May and has a career 6.28 ERA with no experience outside of short-season leagues, so there are some clear concerns. On the other hand, he sits 96-100 and has hit 102 mph, mixing in a curveball that's plus at times, though he struggles to command it. His delivery is athletic and easy, and he'll throw an occasional low-90s changeup that is usable. PERSON needed more innings at a low level of competition to build into 2019 and went to the GPE ORGANIZATION this winter, throwing 13.1 IP with 19 K and 2 BB. At this point, PERSON is similar to a position player who converted to pitching in college and is now draft eligible with huge stuff but little polish; that guy goes roughly in the third round, which is right about where we have him pegged here, but he needs to move quickly and perform now that he's found his role.",0
"As GPE has made slow progress in the ORGANIZATION system -- two summers in the ORGANIZATION, then his 2015 GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION League -- he has shown glimpses of his considerable set of tools. His first two years of full-season ball have been more of the same, with the ORGANIZATION excited to see what comes next.GPE plays the game with passion and without fear. He's very aggressive at the plate and definitely doesn't go up looking to walk. Breaking balls still give him some trouble, and he chases pitches out of the zone too frequently, but when he's under control, he has considerable offensive skills. He has the ability to make solid contact to all fields and while he hasn't shown any semblance of power to date, the ORGANIZATION feel there's a chance he'll still grow into some. His speed allows him to steal some bases. He's also an outstanding defender with a strong arm, one who has shown the ability to play both center and right.GPE might have as much ceiling as any position player in the ORGANIZATION system, even if he's still far away from reaching it. The end result could very well be a solid everyday outfielder in the big leagues.",0
"A big-bodied corner infielder with easy plus raw power, PERSON heated up as postseason play began and raised his stock. He projects over to first base (where he plays when PERSON is ptiching) but could see time at third base early in his career to see if he can stick. His fluid extension through contact is gorgeous and he has the raw power to profile at first base, but whether or not the hit/power combo will be enough is questionable.",1
" When looking at the numbers PERSON has put up in his two years in the GPE, itâs important to keep in mind the ORGANIZATION sent him straight to the full-season ORGANIZATION at age 19 for his stateside debut, then moved up a level in 2012. He definitely has some ability with the bat and has the chance to have above-average power, which really started showing up during his 2012 season in the ORGANIZATION. Heâs an aggressive free-swinger who will have to improve his plate discipline a bit to become a better all-around hitter. He has the defensive tools, from range to arm, to stick at shortstop, but heâs also seen time at second base, giving him the positional flexibility heâll need once PERSON catches up to him.",0
"The ORGANIZATION spent more than $150 million on bonuses, guaranteed salaries and penalty tax on international players during the 2015-16 signing period, and none of them have a higher ceiling than PERSON. A GPE defector who cost GPE Angeles a $16 million bonus and a matching amount in tax, he had a reputation for wildness but showed a surprising amount of polish in his 2016 pro debut. PERSON woes reappeared last season when the ORGANIZATION promoted him aggressively, yet he was overpowering when he found the strike zone.Few pitchers can match PERSON's combination of athleticism and arm speed, which allows him to sit at 94-97 mph into the late innings and reach 101 mph with life on his fastball while exerting little effort. However, his heater can get hit hard when he can't locate it down in the strike zone. Similarly, his upper-80s slider can be a wipeout pitch but also can be ineffective when he can't get it over the plate.PERSON's struggled even more in 2017 with his changeup, which was too firm to throw hitters off balance. He also has messed around with a hard curveball, though refining his slider is a greater priority. If he can't deliver more strikes after his walk rate jumped from 3.2 per nine innings in 2016 to 4.9 last year, his projection will change from frontline starter to high-leverage reliever.",0
"  PERSON helped lead LOCATION High School to the Mississippi 4A state championship this spring and was then drafted 36th overall by the PERSON. The pick raised some eyebrows around the industry, but the PERSON believed he had some of the best catch-and-throw skills in the GPE class. PERSON has a strong arm and was clocked up to 92 mph when he pitched for LOCATION. At 6-foot-3, he has a large frame for a catcher, but his athleticism gives him a chance to remain behind the plate. He is a good receiver and blocks balls well. PERSON isn't as advanced offensively. Though his swing is more geared toward contact than power, scouts expect him to add some pop as he physically matures.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 21, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON has attended numerous Under GPE showcases, and he earned a 2015 ORGANIZATION and a selection onto the 2016 ORGANIZATION Second Team for his efforts.At the high school level with PERSON, ORGANIZATION won GPE 6-6A ORGANIZATION, which helped spark his commitment to PERSON A&M.",0
"PERSON was ranked No. 17 on MLB.com's ORGANIZATION prospects list leading into the 2012 signing period and the ORGANIZATION were thrilled to get the top-ranked catcher from that class for $575,000 as part of a big haul that summer that also included PERSON. PERSON hasn't quite developed as hoped, but he's still young for his level despite having spent the last two full seasons with PERSON in the Class A GPE Atlantic League.The stocky backstop has made some progress and it started to translate a bit into his offensive numbers in 2016. He's shown more extra-base ability over the last two seasons as he continues to work on refining his approach and plate discipline. He had gotten off to a strong start in 2016 when he missed nearly a month with a shin contusion caused by him fouling a ball off his leg. PERSON has one of the strongest arms of any catcher in the ORGANIZATION and a passion for catching, but he has to continue to improve his game calling and working with a pitching staff.PERSON's conditioning has gotten away from him a bit in the past and he will have to work hard to keep his body in shape. But he was also just 20 for all of the 2016 season, giving him plenty of time to develop into the everyday catcher the ORGANIZATION envisioned when they signed him.",0
"PERSON was a name in the back pocket of area scouts in the ORGANIZATION entering the winter of his draft year. Then word started to trickle out that the kid who had missed the summer and fall showcases with an ORGANIZATION tear had turned into a completely different player, one who now had 70 bat speed. Early in the spring, videos of his first few majestic homers led to a rush of national crosscheckers and scouting directors getting in to see PERSON, as most of them never had before. It's rare for a prep hitter to land in the first 10 picks with only one spring of looks and data, none of it on ORGANIZATION, and almost none of it against pro-quality pitching, but PERSON's tools were just that loud: 70 bat speed, easy plus raw power, plus speed, and a plus arm. 
It's similar to how PERSON looked at the same stage, though GPE had a long summer of production, faced strong prep competition, and still only went fifth overall. PERSON's pro debut revealed some weaknesses that aren't evident against mediocre prep pitching and he was clearly overmatched in the ORGANIZATION during his first pro summer and often visibly frustrated. He was 19 in Low-A last year and was able to hit for average, but very little power. Like GPE, PERSON has a good chance to lose a step as his body matures, and move to right field as a result, so pressure is on the bat. Pro scouts don't see the impact power that amateur scouts saw. We're cautiously optimistic that improved strength and swing work will tease out more game power during his age-20 season in the hitter-friendly ORGANIZATION.",0
"When GPE was a surprise callup to the big leagues with the ORGANIZATION in 2015, he became the second pitcher from the GPE Virgin Islands to pitch at the highest level. That was just a one-game visit, but he pitched his way from Double-A to the big leagues again in 2017 with the ORGANIZATION, who acquired him in June 2016 via the ORGANIZATION deal.GPE misses a ton of bats with his fastball-changeup combination. While he'll sit in the 92- to 93-mph range with his fastball, he can get 95-96 mph whenever he needs to and throws it with good life. His bread and butter is that changeup, thrown in the mid-70s with the same arm speed, generating a lot of swings-and-misses. He will mix in a below-average slider to keep hitters honest, but it's really those two offerings, thrown with a ton of deception, that's led GPE to hold hitters to a miniscule batting average against.Improvements with his breaking ball have helped, and he's thrown more strikes this year, though his overall control could stand to improve as well. He has the ceiling of a setup man in the big leagues in the near future. Seeing him in a seventh-inning gig is also a possibility.",1
"A gigantic lefty with a very heavy 88-93mph fastball and advanced usage of three viable secondaries (inluding an excellent changeup that he seldom uses), PERSON's junior season zenith was a 20 strikeout performance against PERSON in April. ",0
"Groshans immediately stood out to scouts on the showcase circuit, showing a ORGANIZATION starter kit with similar swing mechanics, plus raw power projection, a plus arm, and a third base defensive fit. He essentially held serve on that first impression and went 12th overall to the ORGANIZATION out of the same GPE high school as the ORGANIZATION' second round pick, PERSON. Groshans isn't quite the same level athlete as PERSON, and there are contact concerns with an active swing like that, but there are some bat-to-ball skills and plenty of mistake power he can already tap into, as shown in a loud debut in the ORGANIZATION. Many of the pro scouts who saw Groshans weren't fans and saw below average tools in their looks when he fatigued late in the pro season, but the things to watch for here are the plate discipline and contact skills, because the position and power aren't really up for debate right now.",0
"PERSON's development has been a winding road but he's now trending up once again after a 2019 trade from GPE for PERSON. He's age appropriate in Double-A, performing well while striking out a good bit, but his underlying ORGANIZATION numbers suggest he's been unlucky with results, is hitting the ball very hard and is still solid-average in center field.",0
"GPE is the oldest player on The ORGANIZATION and he's only here, despite a career rife with injury and inconsistency, because his stuff is so good. He's among the hardest throwers in professional baseball and also one of the best at spinning the baseball. He is wild and the quality of his secondary stuff is inconsistent, but at times he looks unhittable. He struck out 33 in 23 big league innings last year, but he's currently on the ORGANIZATION with a forearm strain. He could one day pitch his way into high-leverage innings as long as he has this kind of stuff, which he has maintained despite the many maladies.",0
"PERSON didn't perform in his first try at the ORGANIZATION State League, reaching base at just a .255 clip before his season ended with a thumb fracture, which required surgery. Don't be fooled by his unconventional swing; he has feel to hit and feel for lifting the ball in the air regularly. But too often, PERSON swings at whatever he's offered, limiting the quality of his contact and his ability to reach base. At first base, that might be a problem. Scouts have mixed opinions about his body and how it projects into his mid-to-late-20s, which is when PERSON will likely be on the 40-man fringe, perhaps a fit for some clubs in need of, or with room for, a big-bodied masher on their 40-man. The raw power and feel for lift/contact are enticing, but a more sentient approach would be nice.",0
"The top-rated high school left-hander in the 2015 Draft, PERSON has moved quickly since signing with the ORGANIZATION for an over-slot $3,042,400 as the 14th overall pick. But while he made his Major ORGANIZATION debut at age 20 in 2018, his stuff has plateaued and he stands out more for his high floor than his stuff. The ORGANIZATION acquired him this July in exchange for strike-throwing reliever PERSON's fastball comes in at 88-93 mph, grading out as fringy based on velocity, but it plays up to average because he commands the pitch well. Both his changeup and curveball can be above-average, but neither present themselves as true out pitches at the big league level. He's a good strike-thrower but needs pinpoint command to have success in the Majors.PERSON is way ahead of the curve age-wise, providing hope he can figure things out. He knows he can't make a mistake over the plate and is very good to his arm side, but he needs to improve his glove-side command. If he can do a better job of pitching inside against right-handed hitters, that could help him stick as a back-end starter in the big leagues.",1
"Over the summer, PERSON created buzz with his power at the plate, competing in the ORGANIZATION in GPE during All-Star festivities. But teams interested in the standout from PERSON, the same high school 2016 Draft prospect PERSON attended, are more interested in his 6-foot-6 frame on the mound.It was a little tricky evaluating PERSON this spring, between living in a cold-weather area in GPE and a minor shoulder issue that kept him off the mound for a while. But he returned late in the spring and showed some of the stuff that interested scouts in the first place. PERSON has a fastball that he can get up to 95 mph, though he showed more of that over the summer, and sits comfortably in the 90-92 mph range. He struggles with repeating his delivery and his arm slot, which impacts his command. PERSON's velocity would fluctuate, but he'd also show enough left in the tank to touch 93 mph late in games. PERSON has a good feel for a slider, and it could be at least a Major League average offering. He doesn't have much of a changeup.PERSON has a strong commitment to ORGANIZATION and could very easily follow the footsteps of his teammate PERSON, who went on to GSP. Already 19, he would be a Draft-eligible sophomore in two years.",0
"The ORGANIZATION led all organizations by spending $8.4 million during the 2013-14 international signing period. Their biggest bonus went to GPE, who moved from third base to right field after signing for $1.8 million. After batting just .180/.256/.235 in GPE ball in his first two years as a pro, he made the leap to low Class A and began living up to his scouting reports this season despite battling a shoulder injury.GPE has a nice right-handed swing that generates plenty of bat speed, which combined with his strength and the leverage in his 6-foot-3 frame gives him plus raw power. That pop gives him some of the best offensive upside in the system, even if he's a long way from reaching his potential. He still needs to tone down his overly aggressive approach at the plate, but as a guy who will be 19 throughout the season, he has time to work on that.GPE's below-average speed and quickness precipitated his move from third base but shouldn't prevent him from becoming a competent right fielder. He has a strong arm suited for right and has seen limited action in left and center field as well.",0
"PERSON was drafted as a shortstop and then quickly transitioned to the outfield as a professional. His tools and athleticism give him vast potential if he is able to refine his approach at the plate. PERSON is susceptible to good breaking balls and too often swings at pitches out of the zone. If he can become more consistent at the plate, he has a wealth of raw power to tap into. That, combined with his plus speed, could make him an offensive force.  PERSON is much more advanced defensively. He has a solid arm and his speed allows him to effortlessly cover ground in center field. If his bat continues to come around, PERSON could become a solid everyday Major Leaguer.",1
"Because he was a high school teammate of 2019 5th overall pick, PERSON, PERSON was heavily scouted as he broke out during his senior spring. He's a likely third baseman with solid average tools and good actions. He'll likely start in pro ball at shortstop.",0
"A bonus-skimming scandal in 2008 destroyed the FACILITY' international scouting department, which didn't make a significant signing for another five years. That drought ended with PERSON, who signed for $1.6 million out of the ORGANIZATION as ORGANIZATION's No. 2-rated prospect in the 2013-14 international crop (behind only current organizationmate PERSON). PERSON and hamate injuries ruined his first two full years as a pro before he ranked fifth in the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with 16 homers in 2017 -- though that season ended two weeks early when he punched a dugout door in frustration and broke his left pinky.PERSON has two exceptional tools in his raw power and his arm. His combination of bat speed, strength and loft and leverage in his right-handed swing gives him massive pop to all fields. He still needs to make more consistent contact, though he improved last year when he started to recognize pitches better and became less pull-conscious.PERSON has the best arm strength among GPE's position prospects, further enhancing his right-field profile. He has average speed and should be an average defender on an outfield corner. He was diagnosed with a torn flexor muscle and a strained ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow during Spring Training, then played well with the injury until the FACILITY shut him down in July so he could get PERSON surgery in time to be ready for 2019.",0
"PERSON PERSON went third overall in the 1985 Draft before winning 142 games during a 16-year big league career. His son could go even higher in the Draft in 2019, as he's the consensus top prep prospect available. He performed well at several prominent 2018 events, winning the ORGANIZATION at the All-Star Game and claiming ORGANIZATION honors at the Under PERSON All-America Game, the ORGANIZATION and the 18-and-under PERSON in GPE. PERSON named him its 2019 national high school player of the year.A rare potential five-tool shortstop, PERSON didn't always make consistent contact on the showcase circuit last summer but scouts aren't worried about his bat. The right-handed hitter shows good barrel control and some willingness to use the entire field, so he could hit for average if he modifies his aggressive approach. His raw power and speed are both plus tools, which, combined with his baserunning instincts, could make him a 20-20 player.PERSON covers plenty of ground at shortstop, has quick hands and possesses the arm strength to make all the necessary throws -- as well as pump mid-90s fastballs from the mound. His love for the game is evident, and scouts praise his makeup as much as his physical ability. He'll turn 19 shortly after the 2019 Draft, making him old for his class and sophomore-eligible in '21 in the unlikely event he follows through on his commitment to GPE.",0
"GPE is GPE and was one of the youngest players in the 2019 draft. He is an insane athlete with 80 speed and above average bat speed, but is still very raw.",0
"Scouts considered PERSON one of the most polished high school left-handers in the 2016 GPE, but his determination to attend PERSON dropped him to the ORGANIZATION in the 37th round. He emerged as the ORGANIZATION' most reliable starter in the second half of his 2017 freshman season and starred in the ORGANIZATION during the summer, putting himself in position to join PERSON as the only players in school history to go in the first round. He has maintained that status despite being a little inconsistent this spring.PERSON has one of the best curveballs in the GPE, a sharp breaker with power and depth. He works in the low 90s with his fastball, can hit 95 mph when he needs to and locates his heater to either side of the plate. He also mixes in a slider with some tilt and a changeup with some fade.Add in his athleticism, strong build and easy delivery, and PERSON has everything he needs to remain a starter at the next level. His stuff and his control have improved in each of the last two years, and he may not be done getting better. He has extra leverage as a GPE-eligible sophomore.",0
"GPE ORGANIZATION never has had more than one player selected in the first five rounds of a Draft but could have three in June. PERSON and first baseman PERSON have posted strong offensive numbers for three years, while PERSON was the ORGANIZATION's 2019 pitcher of the year. He set GPE records for single-season strikeouts (124 in 83 innings through the regular season) and consecutive scoreless innings (31 entering the conference tournament).PERSON is just 5-foot-11 but produces 88-93 mph fastballs and tops out at 95 with a combination of arm speed and an effortful delivery. His best pitch is his curveball, a plus offering in the upper 70s with 12-6 break when at its best. He also can display a decent changeup but struggles with his feel for the pitch.PERSON' size, mechanics and inconsistent command have him pointed to the bullpen in pro ball. Working in shorter stints, he could have two plus pitches with a harder fastball and curve. He may get an opportunity to prove what he can do as a starter, but he could accelerate quickly to the big leagues as a reliever.",0
" Signed out of GPE in 2013, GPE had a solid, albeit unremarkable, debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2014. So when the infielder hit over .400 during his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION, then kept on raking after a bump up to the GPE, he surprised more than a few people. After a subpar year with the bat in his first try at full-season ball in 2016, he hit his way from the GPE to the ORGANIZATION State League in 2017. That progress caught the attention of the ORGANIZATION, who acquired him in February in exchange for PERSON. An offensive-minded middle infielder whose bat is a little bit ahead of his glove, GPE can really impact the baseball. He has some potential at the plate to hit for average and good extra-base pop, even if that doesn't mean a ton of home runs. He makes consistent hard contact with a fairly advanced approach. He's likely going to be an average runner once he physically matures and has a chance to stay at shortstop with a plus arm and future average range. Still maturing, it's unclear how big GPE might get, but if he can't stay at short, he could be a good defender at second. The ORGANIZATION had no plans to move GPE to another position, though that could change now given the shortstop glut, led by PERSON, in GPE's system.",0
"GPE little pitching prospects aren't supposed to suddenly throw three ticks harder than they did the year before, but GPE went from sitting 89-92 to sitting 92-94, and rose three levels last year. The feel GPE developed for his changeup and curveball while he had a 40 fastball was necessary for his survival at that time. Now, they're out pitches after he gets ahead of hitters with this new heat. There's some risk that this fastball backs up, as upticks in velocity are sometimes fleeting and pitchers soon return to what they've been for most of their careers. So long as that doesn't happen, GPE projects as a good fourth starter and should help the big league club this year.",1
"One of three high school pitchers the ORGANIZATION paid seven-figure bonuses in the middle rounds of the 2014 Draft, PERSON signed for $1 million as a fifth-rounder. As the 139th overall selection, he was the earliest Mississippi prep arm drafted since the ORGANIZATION made PERSON a second-rounder in 1999. He made the jump to full-season ball for the first time in 2016, but he had mechanical issues that affected his stuff and control.PERSON attacks hitters with three pitches that grade as solid or better when at their best. He sits at 91-92 mph and reaches 95 with his fastball, which generates groundballs with its sink and run. He can miss bats with his curveball, which has good depth and is getting more consistent, and also has a deceptive change with fade.PERSON isn't the most physical pitcher, and his control and command are still works in progress, so there's some thought that he'll wind up as a reliever. But as an athletic lefty with a three-pitch arsenal and a strong competitive streak, he could develop into a mid-rotation starter.",0
"It's possible PERSON would be talked about now as one of the better pitching prospects of the game if he hadn't gotten hurt. But the talented right-hander needed PERSON surgery after just three starts in 2014, missing the rest of that and the 2015 season. PERSON has a big arm when he's healthy, sitting in the 93-95 mph and touching the upper-90s. PERSON's breaking ball has morphed a bit over time. It was more of a power curve two years ago before the injury, but it's turned into more of a slider and looked like it could be a plus one eventually based on how he was throwing it at instructs last fall. He has good feel for his changeup, giving him the chance to have three above-average pitches once he gets back to full strength. PERSON is still learning how to pitch, but there wasn't too much rust upon his return even though he hadn't pitched competitively for nearly two years. If he is back to where he was before the surgery, he has the chance to have among the best stuff in the ORGANIZATION system.",1
"PERSON originally tried out for teams as a 6-foot-4 shortstop in the ORGANIZATION before signing with the ORGANIZATION as a pitcher for $85,000 in October 2012. He spent his first two pro seasons in the Rookie-level ORGANIZATION before making a huge leap forward in 2015, performing so well in extended spring training that he skipped a level to the ORGANIZATION. He got off to a late start in 2016 after coming down with a sore elbow during Spring Training.The most physical pitcher in GPE's system, PERSON is bigger than his listed 6-foot-4 and 200 pounds and still has projection remaining. His present stuff already is enticing, starting with a 92-95 mph fastball that can reach 97 and plays up because of its movement, angle and plane. His curveball lacks consistency but features power and shows signs of becoming a plus offering.PERSON's changeup is less refined but he exhibits some feel for the pitch. He has good athleticism and body control for a big pitcher, allowing him to repeat his delivery and pound the strike zone.",0
"  An elite athlete, PERSON is a three-sport star in high school. The same athleticism that allows him to throw down dunks on the basketball court has helped him develop into a coveted right-hander. PERSON' fastball sits in the low 90s and tops out at 95 mph with excellent life. His sharp slider is his best secondary offering and has the potential to be a swing-and-miss offering. His changeup and curveball give him two more pitches that have the chance to be average or better. PERSON, a GPE recruit, has a loose, easy delivery and repeats it well. His long, lean build leads scouts to believe he could add more velocity as he gets stronger and focuses solely on baseball.",0
"GPE is the grandson of PERSON, who pitched at ORGANIZATION State before saving 110 games in an 11-year big league career. GPE spent his first two college seasons and the beginning of his third in the bullpen before transitioning to the rotation in mid-March. He initially pitched well in his new role before tiring down the stretch.GPE operates at 91-93 mph with sink on his fastball and is capable of reaching 96. His slider shows signs of becoming a plus pitch and creeps into the mid-80s, though it gets slurvy at times. His changeup has occasional tumble but lacks behind his other two offerings.There's some hesitation in GPE's delivery that costs him consistency with the quality of his pitches and his command. His arm action and lack of size almost certainly will point him back toward the bullpen in pro ball, and his fastball and slider could play up in shorter stints.",0
"An everyday player at multiple infield positions for Michigan the last three years, GPE set a school record with 12 saves as a sophomore in 2014 and has shuttled between the bullpen and rotation this spring. The burden of double duty and changing mound roles caused his stuff to fade down the stretch, but scouts would love to see what he can do when he focuses solely on pitching in pro ball.GPE has the best splitter in the GPE, and 83-86 mph offering that tumbles at the plate and elicits consistent swings and misses. He uses it too much, to the detriment of his fastball command. His heater ranges from 88-94 mph with some run and sink, and he also has an inconsistent slider.GPE figures to get an opportunity to start as a pro but likely will be a reliever. He lacks size, has a so-so delivery and had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his shoulder following his freshman year. Part of the ORGANIZATION's national team identification program in high school, he's a good athlete and a tough competitor.",0
"Injuries to his left foot and shoulder dogged PERSON in college at GPE, and surgery on his foot forced him to miss his first pro summer after the ORGANIZATION drafted him in the 11th round in 2015. The younger brother of ORGANIZATION catching prospect PERSON, he broke into pro ball by posting an .891 OPS in high Class A in 2016, leading the GPE League in runs (96), hits (159) and doubles (39) while stealing 30 bases. He has been productive since, albeit with less power, while earning comparisons to PERSON for his athleticism and energy.PERSON offers steady if not spectacular offensive production. He has hit for average and shown on-base ability throughout his ORGANIZATION career, making repeated contact from the right side of the plate. He's strong and has some quickness to his swing that has translated into gap power, and he's an aggressive baserunner with solid speed.Though PERSON played primarily in left field during his first two pro seasons, he has spent more time in right field in 2018 and has the range and arm strength to play all three outfield spots. He also played third base for the ORGANIZATION and could handle spot duty on the infield corners. His versatility helps his cause because he profiles more as a reserve than as an everyday outfielder.",0
"PERSON's athleticism got him drafted in the second round by the ORGANIZATION in 2013 but didn't translate into immediate results in pro ball. After PERSON traded him to the PERSON for PERSON in January, he struggled so much in training camp that he was held back in extended spring training to work on his delivery. He reported to low Class A Quad Cities in May and earned a promotion to high Class A Lancaster two months later. PERSON pitching coaches have helped PERSON with his mechanics, and the result is that he's throwing more strikes than ever. His slider also has improved significantly and looks like it will become at least an average pitch. PERSON's best offering is his fastball, which currently ranges from 89-92 to 94. He's so athletic and projectable that he should add more velocity in the future. He also shows some feel for a changeup with sink and could have three average or better pitches when he's fully developed.",1
"When the ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON in the first round of the 2014 Draft, they knew it might take some time for his raw tools and athleticism to translate into productivity. A quad injury that allowed him to play just 53 games in 2015 didn't help his development and needing PERSON surgery last August will delay him even further.More than anything, PERSON needs to stay healthy. Before the elbow injury late in 2016, he was showing signs of figuring some things out and gaining confidence. He needs to continue to improve his pitch recognition and his game plan, striving to have better barrel awareness in the strike zone. PERSON strength will help him at the plate, though he's not likely to be a big over-the-fence power threat. His best tool is his outstanding speed. It allows him to steal bases -- he had 35 in 2016 -- and play a highlight-reel-caliber center field on a regular basis. He's learning things like bunting to further take advantage of his speed.It can take some players longer to figure things out and patience with a player that has these kinds of tools is essential. The ORGANIZATION still feel that once he's healthy and he physically matures, it will start to come together for PERSON.",0
"  During his professional debut in 2013, PERSON led the GPE League in ORGANIZATION and was named the ORGANIZATION of the LOCATION playoffs after a promotion to short-season Vancouver. Though he wasn't quite as good statistically when he moved to full-season ball the next year, he earned All-Star honors in the ORGANIZATION and another late-season promotion to high Class A GPE.PERSON has quick hands and generally maintains a good approach at the plate, though his production dipped when he returned to GPE in 2015. He shows big raw power during batting practice, but that hasn't shown up much yet in games. Defensively, he's improved his play at third base and has a strong arm.Power is often the last tool to develop and if PERSON can unlock his, he'll have all the makings of a prototypical third baseman.",0
"As a high school third baseman at ORGANIZATION in GPE, PERSON went undrafted. After three years at the ORGANIZATION of GPE, that won't happen again, as he was swinging a hot bat at the right time as the GPE approached.PERSON was making consistent, hard contact for the ORGANIZATION as his junior season progressed. He's always had raw power, but didn't always look like he could tap into it consistently. Lately, however, he's shortened his swing and begun to use the whole field more effectively, showing extra-base pop to the opposite field. Much of his success stems from a more open stance which has helped him get his hips through more consistently. He's a first baseman only with well below-average speed, though his hands and footwork at the corner infield position should be adequate. As a right-right first baseman, the bat is really going to have to play. Offensive college performers tend to do well in the GPE, and PERSON's raw natural power was giving him some helium as the spring progressed.",0
"It's easy to fall in love with PERSON after just watching him take infield. Not only is he coordinated and acrobatic, but his throws to first sizzle through the air, even with just a flick of his wrist. He has one of the best infield arms in the minors and should be an above-average defender at maturity. At the plate, he lacks even a modicum of strength and has near bottom-of-the-scale power from both sides of the plate. He's a competent slash and dash hitter, but that's becoming less common, even at shortstop. Tigers fans who visit this site are likely acquainted with PERSON' player page. PERSON was a better defender than PERSON (and, well, just about everybody) and had better feel for contact with similar power, and is someone we'd ideally have as a 45 or 50 on prospect lists based on his' WAR production. PERSON, PERSON needs to be beneath those tiers. He could be a speedy, versatile bench infielder for a long time, though.",0
" PERSON missed much of the 2012 and 2013 seasons after undergoing PERSON surgery. He has played well since returning to action - appearing in back-to-back Futures PERSON - and his longterm outlook hasn't be negatively affected by the injury.  PERSON is a defensive-oriented catcher. His strong arm has helped him to throw out more than 40 percent of would-be basestealers in his career. He is athletic behind the plate and blocks balls well.  PERSON's bat isn't as well regarded, he has a solid offensive skillset. He is an aggressive hitter, but doesn't give away at bats. He drives balls to the gaps with his line-drive swing and strength. His defense is enough to get him to the big leagues as a backup and if he proves he can hit a bit, he could become something more.",0
"Blessed with arm strength, but not always the ability to harness it, PERSON has moved slowly through the lower levels of the ORGANIZATION system since signing back in 2012. The ORGANIZATION left-hander spent two seasons in the ORGANIZATION before making his GPE debut in the ORGANIZATION in 2015. Another step forward to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn PERSON led to him making his full-season debut at age 22 in 2017.The ORGANIZATION have long liked PERSON's stuff. He'll sit comfortably in the low-90s and touch the mid-90s on occasion, thrown with good life. His secondary stuff still needs some work, but he has improved in that area as well. He does show a feel to spin a breaking ball and will flash an above-average one from time to time. It will vary from curveball to slider shape. He does have a changeup that has the chance to eventually become an average offering. PERSON's biggest issue has been with his command. He cut his walk rate considerably in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn PERSON in 2016, but he still carried a 5.7 BB/9 ratio into the 2017 season.The good news is that PERSON keeps improving his overall pitchability as he continues to move forward. Working out of a rotation will allow him to keep working on all of his stuff and his feel for pitching, with PERSON knowing his live arm could work well out of the bullpen if needed.",1
"PERSON was viewed as a bit of wild card heading into the 2013 Draft after PERSON surgery had wiped out his entire senior season at GPE (Ariz.) High. Intrigued by PERSON's upside, the ORGANIZATION selected him in the third round and convinced him to sign for $500,000, $150,000 less than his pick value. But the right-hander experienced numbness in his arm and hand when he got back on the mound, prompting surgeons to treat him for thoracic outlet syndrome by removing one of his ribs to alleviate a pinched nerve. When his symptoms failed to improve, PERSON had a nerve removed from his elbow. After making a healthy return in 2016 and building up his workload the following year, PERSON broke out in earnest in 2018, earning PERSON of the Year honors in the ORGANIZATION State League before a late bump to Double-A. The ORGANIZATION added PERSON to their 40-man roster after the season. Big and strong, PERSON will sit at 92-95 mph and touch 97, throwing his heater with downhill plane and sinking action that makes him difficult to barrel. His power curveball flashes plus, registering at 75-79 mph with tight spin and late bite, and he shows feel for throwing a firm changeup that improved as the season played out. What's more, PERSON racked up more strikeouts in 2018 (8.4 K/9) than at any point in his career and led all Minor League hurlers (140 IP min.) with a 59.1 percent ground-ball rate. More important than the results, PERSON stayed healthy for the entire season, accruing 152 2/3 innings across 27 starts. There are a range of outcomes in projecting PERSON's development, but more and more the signs are pointing to a bright future for him as a Nos. 4 or 5 starter.",0
"Initially drafted out of high school by the Nationals in the 14th round of the 2015 Draft, PERSON opted not to sign. But instead of heading to PERSON, he went to GPE Beach State, a two-year junior college. That meant he was eligible for the Draft a year later, and the D-backs nabbed him in the sixth round. He struck out more than a batter per inning at two stops during his summer debut.The big lefty has the chance to have a good three-pitch mix when all is said and done. He has good life on his low-90s fastball and can command it to both sides of the plate, impressing the D-backs with his willingness to pitch inside effectively. He can spin a good breaking ball and has feel for his developing changeup. With a good delivery and mound presence, there might be more in the tank as he physically matures.PERSON's pro debut last summer had the D-backs encouraged, though he struggled to replicate the results during his full season debut in 2017 There's some ceiling here, with the potential for the southpaw to develop into a solid mid-to-back-of-the-rotation piece.",0
"Few players in the ORGANIZATION system have as great a difference between their present ability and future potential than PERSON, who was signed out of the ORGANIZATION in 2011. He has spent four consecutive years in GPE ball before he started to show signs of breaking out in 2015. That breakout has become a reality for the left-hander this season, as he ranks among the ORGANIZATION leaders in most pitching categories. In GPE, PERSON pitched for the World squad in the ORGANIZATION Game.PERSON is a 6-foot-6 left-hander with a fastball that already reaches 94 mph and features nice life. And with room to add even more strength to his large frame, some scouts believe he will eventually sit in the mid-90s. He has a chance to have two average secondary pitches, with his changeup currently grading better than his slider.Pedromo's control and command are still very much works in progress, but he has enough deception and natural movement to generate whiffs and weak contact even when he missed a spot. As a southpaw who could grow into a mid-90s fastball, he'll get plenty of opportunity to prove himself as a starter. At the same time, it doesn't take much effort to envision how his stuff might play out of the bullpen.",0
"ORGANIZATION didn't make much of an impression with a 9.45 GPE in GPE's top league as a 17-year-old in 2011-12, but he showed enough in a workout facing other GPE defectors that the PERSON signed him for $40,000 in September 2014. He has the best pitchability among PERSON's pitching prospects, which has allowed him to succeed at every level of the system. He had his best year yet in 2017, reaching Triple-A while topping PERSON farmhands in GPE (2.04), strikeouts (146) and ORGANIZATION (1.04).Hitters can't square up ORGANIZATION' fairly ordinary stuff because he moves his deep repertoire all around the strike zone. His lone above-average pitch is his deceptive changeup, which he has complete faith in. He can change eye levels by mixing sinking 88-92 mph two-seam fastballs and riding 91-95 mph four-seamers, and he also knows how to play his average curveball and slider/cutter off each other.ORGANIZATION tends to fall off the mound with his delivery, which throws batters off even more without compromising his ability to throw strikes. He has to be fine with his pitches and he is. A safe bet to become a back-of-the-rotation starter, he has nothing left to prove in the Minors but returned to Triple-A because PERSON has no openings in its rotation.",0
"  PERSON had a storied amateur career in GPE and was ranked No. 2 in the 2012 international free agent class by MLBPipeline.com before signing with the ORGANIZATION. His amateur success carried over to the professional ranks and he led the LOCATION in a host of offensive categories in 2014. In November, he was a part of the package the A's acquired in exchange for PERSON Donaldson.PERSON is an aggressive hitter but has a knack for putting the bat on the ball. His compact swing and quick hands allow him to consistently make hard contact. He has more home-run power than most middle infielders and is a plus runner.In the field, PERSON isn't as advanced. He has good range and a strong arm, but he's very erratic and lacks the natural actions of a shortstop. He's just a teenager, however, and will get every opportunity to prove he can stick at the position.",1
"GPE and prospect status came on late to put GPE in the top group of pitchers in the class. He's been into the mid-90's and has some projection, but the offspeed stuff and feel is a bit behind the other arms in the top tier.",0
"When PERSON was coming out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE in 2015, he had one of the best power bats in the entire Draft class. Since the ORGANIZATION took him 34th overall that June, he has more than lived up to that hype, hitting 58 homers over his first two full seasons of pro ball and carrying a career .508 slugging percentage into the 2018 season.Thanks to a very quick bat, PERSON can drive the ball out of the park, and for extra bases, to all fields. There will always be some swing and miss to his game, but he did cut down his strikeout rate a touch in 2017 and he does offset the whiffs by drawing a good amount of walks. He has worked on his overall approach and tried to cut down on his swing to allow him to tap into his tremendous raw power consistently. PERSON is going to have to hit because he is a below-average defender in left field with a below-average arm. The ORGANIZATION love PERSON's work ethic and that he doesn't just spend all of his time in the cage working on his one carrying tool, instead putting in great effort to show he is capable enough to play the outfield regularly. The ORGANIZATION think he'll catch what he can get to and won't be a DH only. Either way, his power bat is just about ready to contribute in GPE.",0
"PERSON was reaching the mid-90s on the mound last summer but hasn't been throwing well this spring . Despite that, he's hitting for huge power with (literally) magnitudes more home runs than strikeouts. He's a premium athlete with with plus-plus bat speed and a ORGANIZATION body comp. Scouts have questioned his feel to hit but PERSON has already shown an ability to make some adjustments, evidence he'll be able to make more sould he need to in pro ball. He runs well but the body projects out of center field and, assuming his arm strength returns, to right field where he's a risky, potential middle of the order bat.",0
"PERSON didn't generate any headlines when he signed for $225,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2012, but he has attracted plenty of attention since making his GPE debut two years later. He started drawing comparisons to Jose PERSON and teams almost immediately started asking for him in trade talks. After leading the Minors with 82 steals when he made the jump to full-season ball in 2015, he's putting together a nice encore in high Class A -- with the exception of a two-week suspension for insubordination in July that cost him a trip to the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON Game.A true top-of-the-scale runner, PERSON can get from the right side of the plate to first base in less than 4.0 seconds and has basestealing skills to boot, succeeding on 83 percent of his attempts in his first four pro seasons. More than just a slap-and-dash guy, he has wiry strength and displays solid raw power during batting practice that has yet to manifest itself during games. He could develop into a 15-homer threat, though getting on base is a higher priority and he'll need to tighten up his strike zone to do that.Initial scouting reports on PERSON raised some concerns about his throwing arm, but it has gotten stronger and now grades as a plus tool. With his actions, range, hands and arm, he'll stay at shortstop for the long term. He needs to improve his defensive consistency after making 30 errors in 99 games last year.",0
"In mid-July, PERSON was moved from the bullpen (where he had been in college) to GPE's rotation, and his performance dipped despite the fact that he had often thrown multiple innings as a reliever. He struck out a batter per inning in relief but as a starter his velo was down, his strikeout rate was significantly down (from 24% to 14%), and he was more hittable. It's a sign his future is in the bullpen as a fastball/curveball middle reliever.",0
"ORGANIZATION (N.C.) HS had a nice Draft run in the mid-1980s, with first-rounders and future big leaguers PERSON (1985) and PERSON (1986) plus third-rounder PERSON (1987). The ORGANIZATION's best prospect since then, PERSON posted video-game numbers as a junior, going 12-1 with a 0.08 ORGANIZATION and 174 strikeouts in 83 1/3 innings as ORGANIZATION lost in the state 1-A finals after winning championships in his first two seasons. His stuff has taken a dramatic leap forward during his senior season, so much so that he's in a group of players the Twins are considering with the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall choice. PERSON named him the national player of the year.After PERSON's fastball sat at 89-92 mph and reached 94 last summer, it has jumped about 3 mph this spring. He has maintained his newfound velocity into the late innings and continues to show feel for spotting his heater on both sides of the plate. His curveball has emerged as a true plus pitch and the best of his secondary offerings, which also include a hard slider and a tumbling changeup that also grade as plus at their best.Scouts love PERSON's athleticism and competitiveness. He employs a big leg kick and gets good extension in his delivery, creating a deceptive look that can throw hitters off. He's committed to GPE but unlikely to get there after his development this spring.",0
"PERSON was outstanding as ORGANIZATION's ace and finished his college career with a 23-9 record and 2.80 ERA, racking up 285 strikeouts over three seasons. The A's selected the right-hander in the second round of the 2014 Draft, and he offered a taste of his potential in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League after signing for $750,000. Although he struggled during his introduction to full-season ball in 2015, PERSON was able to make some adjustments over the course of the season and finished the year on a high note before truly breaking out in '16.PERSON's fastball sits in the low 90s, topping out at 95-96 mph, and has arm-side run and late sinking action. His curveball projects to be above average and is his best secondary offering at the moment, though he also has good feel for a changeup that could be at least PERSON average once developed. His slider was his go-to out pitch at ORGANIZATION, but it's been below average as a pro and requires further refinement.Though pounding the zone has never been an issue for PERSON, his first full season indicated that the quality of his strikes must improve. Some scouts wonder if he'll have the durability to remain in the rotation, although that hasn't been an issue so far. ORGANIZATION officials believe he has what it takes to be a big league starter, and the club's track record of developing undersized right-handers bodes well for his future in the role.",0
"GPE is a bat-first prospect with power and some chance to stick at second base, who signed for $1 million as a 2017 fourth round pick. Early-career hip surgery has limited his defensive mobility, so he's more of a wait-and-see, somewhat one-dimensional prospect to keep an eye on in 2019. If everything comes together he could be a passable second baseman with game power.",0
"GPE has recognized PERSON as one of the more polished prep pitchers in GPE, but he didn't raise his profile until his body and stuff got stronger this spring. Now he's a good bet to get selected in the first five rounds and signed away from his commitment to Tennessee.After sitting at 85-88 mph with his fastball last summer, PERSON has added 15 pounds and now deals at 89-91 mph and peaks at 93. He commands his fastball very well and excels at getting it inside on the hands of righties. While his curveball needs more power and consistency, he shows feel for spin and his bender has some depth.PERSON also shows some aptitude for throwing a changeup but mainly works with his fastball and curve. He repeats he fluid, high-three-quarters delivery well. He may not have a true plus pitch, but his stuff plays up because he can command it and gives him a higher floor than most high school pitchers.",0
"PERSON's career may have started off on the wrong foot, with the 2013 second-round pick needing PERSON surgery the fall after he was drafted. But it really took off in 2015 as the switch-hitting catcher made the most of a promotion to Double-A, improved every facet of his game and earned organizational Minor League player of the year honors.There's no question PERSON can hit, with the ability to hit for average and power from both sides of the plate. He improved his plate discipline in Double-A, a big reason for him getting on a roll and seemingly never stopping. Fully recovered from his surgery, PERSON's solid arm can help control the running game. He's made progress on the other facets of catching, showing the ability to call a good game and work well with a pitching staff. PERSON knows his receiving skills still need work and he's fully invested in improving them.PERSON's breakout puts him very firmly on the catching prospect map. He's a half-step ahead of PERSON developmentally, and he and the trade acquisition potentially could battle it out for everyday catching duty in GSP.",0
"Few prospects have more raw power than PERSON, but questions about his ability to make contact and play defense cloud his future. The D-backs traded PERSON to the ORGANIZATION to get PERSON in July 2014, but PERSON's new front-office regime shipped him to the Royals in January 2017 for PERSON right-hander PERSON. In between, PERSON hit six homers in 36 big league games -- including shots off PERSON and PERSON -- but also fanned 32 times in 79 plate appearances.PERSON's power is legit. He has the ability to hit the ball out of any park to all fields. That has translated into 106 homers in four full PERSON seasons, including 24 in 105 Triple-A games last season. Whether he can tap into it consistently at the highest level remains to be seen, as a lack of plate discipline and length to his swing lead to high strikeout and low walk totals. PERSON broke into pro ball as a catcher but has receiving and throwing issues, and he was erratic and lacked range when he tried to play third base. He has a strong arm but doesn't have much athleticism or quickness, so he has migrated to left field and first base. Moving to an ORGANIZATION club where DHing is an option could be a positive for his career.",0
"  PERSON was a well-regarded prospect coming out of high school in 2012 and he began his career sharing the left side of the infield in the ORGANIZATION organization with PERSON, the first overall pick in that year's Draft. That duo was broken up in January when the ORGANIZATION included PERSON in the package they sent to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION trade.After struggling at the outset of his professional career, PERSON made a mechanical adjustment to his swing that has led to much better production. He has demonstrated good on-base skills and does a good job of using the whole field to hit. His power largely translated to doubles to doubles in the low levels of the ORGANIZATION, but as he physically matures he should start driving more balls over the fence. Though PERSON still has room for improvement defensively, he has the look of a future everyday third baseman in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"Not every success story from the international market is a high-profile, big bonus signing. GPE signed with the ORGANIZATION for just $10,000 in December 2014 and he was already 19 years old when he joined the organization. He climbed steadily through PERSON's system and had reached Double-A shortly before he was sent along with PERSON to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION Pressly deal.The ORGANIZATION didn't get the best look at GPE after the trade, as the right-hander was a little dinged up and fatigued at season's end, so they are excited to see him at full strength. GPE has watched his velocity climb as he's progressed and is now up in the 95-98 mph range consistently with good life. His secondary stuff has gotten better, and he missed more bats in 2018, though he's still working on their refinement. His slider and curve are both power breaking balls that run into each other at times and his changeup does get too firm.More than anything, it will be GPE's command that determines his ultimate role. He will have to find the strike zone on a more regular basis to remain a starter, something the ORGANIZATION will be evaluating this year, knowing that seeing triple digits from GPE in shorter relief stints is a distinct possibility.",0
"PERSON was acquired from the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION deal and has loud tools, with all but the hit tool grading above average. The power may not play in games due to an indiscriminate approach, rather than poor bat control. That will be more palatable if PERSON can stay in center field, but the general consensus is that he's a right fielder. He's more of a low-end regular type in a corner.",0

The right-handed pitcher made the All-Tournament Team at the 2014 14U ORGANIZATION Finals.Aquino has a side-to-side delivery and can sometimes get out in front of his pitches, but his arm strength should continue to develop. With more refinement, his fastball, slow curve and changeup can continue to improve.",0
"As a sophomore in 2015, PERSON served as PERSON's No. 1 starter ahead of eventual Twins second-rounder PERSON. PERSON pitched through the spring with an injury to his non-throwing shoulder, then took the summer off before impressing during fall practice. He has had a rough spring from a statistical standpoint, though scouts still like his stuff enough to project him as a starter and a possible second-round pick.The velocity on PERSON's sinking fastball has climbed steadily, from the upper 80s as an GPE high schooler, to the low 90s in his first two college seasons, to a consistent 93-94 mph that he holds deep into games and a high of 96 this spring. He has aptitude for spinning a hard curveball that's at least a plus pitch at its best but lacks consistency. PERSON will also flash a changeup with some tumble and fade but PERSON coaches seldom call for it during games.A 38th-round pick of the ORGANIZATION in 2013, PERSON features a quick arm but he also has some effort to his delivery. That leads to concerns that he might not have more than average control and command, as well as whether he'll be able to maintain quality stuff over a full pro season as a starter.",0
"  PERSON was the A's top signing in the 2013 international free agent class. The native of PERSON made his professional debut as a 17-year-old in the Rookie-level PERSON, where he was one of the youngest players.PERSON didn't take up switch-hitting until late in his amateur career, but his natural feel at the plate made him a quick study. He has an advanced approach at the plate for a teenager and projects to develop some power as he physically matures.PERSON's advanced feel for the game extends to the infield, where he has good hands and actions. But even as an amateur, some scouts felt he lacked the athleticism for shortstop and would eventually need to move. He saw time at both shortstop and second base during his debut.",0
"Since PERSON made his pro debut in 2013 after signing for $1.75 million in July 2012, the GPE shortstop has been at least three years younger than the average position player at his level. He's held his own at every step and is now handling the upper levels of the ORGANIZATION' system.PERSON actually finished the 2015 season in Double-A and played in the LOCATION playoffs after the ORGANIZATION jumped him over low Class A ball to the Class A Advanced PERSON for his full-season debut. He's continued to employ a contact-oriented approach at the plate, with some ability to hit the gaps for extra bases. Extremely athletic with a projectable frame, there's still strength PERSON can add, which should allow him to drive the ball more, with some home run pop to come. He has outstanding speed, hands, footwork and a very strong arm, everything he needs to stay at shortstop long term.Those who see PERSON as a future second baseman likely view PERSON as the ORGANIZATION' shortstop of the future. He could be more than ready to take over full time right when free-agent acquisition PERSON's contract is up.",1
" PERSON became the highest drafted player out of GPE in nearly 40 years when the ORGANIZATION took him with the first pick of the second round in 2013. After spending his first full professional season with PERSON, he was dealt to GPE during the offseason in the trade that sent PERSON to GPE. PERSON's velocity spiked during his junior year at GPE, but his command isn't as fine when his fastball pushes into the mid 90s. His changeup is his best secondary pitch, and he effectively mixes in both a curveball and slider. If he can recover his command, PERSON's advanced feel for pitching and solid four-pitch mix give him the chance to start advancing more quickly through the ORGANIZATION. He earns praise for his makeup and work ethic.",0
"PERSON was a two-way player in his first two seasons at FACILITY A&M, serving as a reliever and bat off the bench in 2012 and as a starter and a regular at ORGANIZATION in 2013. He focused exclusively on pitching with PERSON last summer and again this spring with the Aggies.PERSON has a lot going on in his delivery, but his mechanics add some deception and don't prevent him from throwing strikes with four pitches. His best offering is a fastball that usually ranges from 88-94 mph, though it can get straight at times. His slider is a close second, arriving at 82-85 mph and featuring some sharp bite when he stays on top of it.He also throws a downer curveball that isn't quite as consistent as his slider, and he has the confidence to use his fading changeup in any count. PERSON may not have a true plus pitch, but he could have four average offerings. PERSON love his makeup and believe he can remain a starter in pro ball.",1
"PERSON was one of just two ORGANIZATION Division I players to total 20 homers and 15 steals in 2017, joining PERSON star and PERSON supplemental first-rounder Brent Rooker, but his stock took a hit as a junior after he changed his setup and didn't hit for as much power. PERSON, whose father PERSON was a Red Sox 13th-round choice in 1991 and his brother PERSON was a Rays third-rounder two decades later, still had a productive season, hitting 10 homers and stealing 21 bags, and the A's took him with the ORGANIZATION. 70 overall pick in June, signing him for $1,232,000. PERSON's bat speed and strength create natural power from the right side of the plate, but he sold out for home runs as a junior with negative results. He widened his setup, adopted more of a crouch and was overly aggressive and pull-happy. Though he doesn't always get out of the box quickly when he takes a big hack, PERSON can show plus speed once he gets going.PERSON may not have true shortstop quickness, but he has a chance to stay at the position with his good body control, soft hands and cannon arm.

He dropped to the sixth round in the GPE, where the ORGANIZATION grabbed him. PERSON returned strong and pitched well during his professional debut. He doesn't have overpowering stuff but knows how to get the most out of his tools. His changeup is his best pitch, and his above-average command allows his whole arsenal to play up. His advanced understanding of his craft could allow him to advance quickly in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"Signed for above slot value by the Pirates in 2014 after they drafted him in the supplemental second round, PERSON spent two years in GPE's system before heading to the ORGANIZATION with PERSON in a December 2015 trade. He struggled with the move up to Class A Advanced Carolina in 2017, but he returned there last season and earned honors as a mid-season All-Star before advancing to Double-A in late May. PERSON pitched well in the LOCATION, showing an impressive four-pitch mix en route to a 2.91 ERA over 16 starts, and the ORGANIZATION added him to their 40-man roster after the season.PERSON's velocity has improved as he's grown into his big frame and learned to better repeat his delivery, and he spent his breakout 2018 campaign sitting in the low 90s and touching 95 mph. The 6-foot-5 right-hander will use his height to create angle to the plate, showing feel for pounding the bottom of the zone or elevating his heater with some riding life. His slider and changeup have above-average potential, and he throws both more than he does his mid-70s curveball, a fringy pitch that he can locate for strikes. He's consistently around the zone with all four pitches, demonstrating an above-average control profile, though his command still requires refinement.The fly-ball tendencies that hurt PERSON at times in 2017 improved last season, as he generated more ground-ball contact and did a better job of keeping the ball in the park. His feel for mixing his pitches translates to solid, if unspectacular strikeout rates right now, and he might not miss as many bats at higher levels given his velocity and lack of a put-away pitch. That said, PERSON has all the ingredients to be a successful big league starter, with size, stuff and feel for pitching that point to him becoming a durable, back-of-the-rotation asset for the ORGANIZATION.",0
"The ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON in the 22nd round out of high school in 2010 as an outfielder, and he spent most of his freshman season at ORGANIZATION as a position player. He became a full-time pitcher as a sophomore and signed for $70,000 as a 15th-round pick in 2013.PERSON was solely a reliever in college and though he has seen some time as a piggyback starter as a pro, his future is in the bullpen. He's tough on left-handers with a 90-94 mph fastball that runs in on them and a tight upper-70 slider.PERSON is less effective against righties, in part because his changeup lags behind his other pitches. His quick arm and athleticism allow him to generate velocity without a lot of effort, which in turn makes it relatively easy for him to find the strike zone.",0
"GPE is rumored to have turned down around $2 million out of high school from the ORGANIZATION, then he got scooped up after two years at ORGANIZATION by the ORGANIZATION in the 9th round. He didn't progress much in GPE, leaving as the same below average catcher defender he was in high school and still having a strong lefty bat and average raw power, but now with more of a performance track record.",0
"PERSON had a breakout 2017, then blew out his elbow early in 2018. He's back throwing bullpens as this list goes to publication. The flashes of brilliance he showed during 2017 Extended indicated a potential No. 4 starter future, as PERSON's fastball would creep into the mid-90s and he'd show you a good change and breaking ball. He casts a lot of his pitches to his arm side and mechanical consistency and command are the biggest parts of his development, as he'll need to improve in that area to remain a starter. Of course, that's assuming his pre-surgery stuff returns.",0
"The ORGANIZATION liked PERSON heading into the 2013 Draft, but the ORGANIZATION State standout went seven picks earlier in the second round that June to the ORGANIZATION. They'd been keeping an eye on him since and were happy to get him in an offseason deal that was officially in return for PERSON PERSON, but which most feel was compensation for the ORGANIZATION hiring special assistant PERSON away from the ORGANIZATION. PERSON likes pitchers who can elicit ground-ball outs and PERSON fits that description well, with a solid GO/AO ratio throughout his ORGANIZATION career. His fastball is only a tick above average, but can play up to a 60 on the 20-80 scouting scale because of its sink. His slider will also flash above-average at times and he effectively mixes in a fringy changeup and curveball. His ability to mix pitches not only leads to weak contact, but he can miss bats on occasion as well.PERSON' sinker-slider combination very well could end up in the bullpen, but his makeup, durability and penchant for putting the ball on the ground give him a chance to start.",1
"PERSON's dalliance with college basketball is now over, after two years at ORGANIZATION's and then one sitting out at ORGANIZATION State Northridge. Focusing on baseball full-time for the first time, PERSON showed glimpses of his enormous potential during his first prolonged taste of full-season ball.Despite his lack of pitching resume, PERSON brings some pretty big stuff to the table, especially for a lefty. His fastball sits in the 92-94 range and he's shown the ability to reach back for a little more while commanding it fairly well. His slider improved over the course of the year, though he could stand to tighten it up some more. He showed some feel for a changeup as well. At 6-foot-5, he has trouble keeping his delivery together, but his athleticism gives him a tremendous amount of upside. PERSON made some tremendous adjustments in 2014, and the ORGANIZATION added him to the 40-man roster during the offseason. Now that he's truly invested in learning how to pitch, he has the chance to really take off.",0
"Teams have likely already studied this, but during our in-person looks at PERSON, which date back to 2014, he seems to generate top spin on batted balls with more regularity than is typical for hitters. That's not a good thing, as the same way a curveball does, it causes PERSON's fly balls to sink and die at a lesser distance than they should. We have no idea if the ability to hit balls with no spin (which is ideal) is a skill hitters have, but if it is, PERSON probably isn't one of them. He does have power though, and he's a viable defensive third baseman who'd be capable of moonlighting at short or second base if PERSON needed him to. We like him as a versatile, bat-first prospect who can play all over the place.",1
"ORGANIZATION' PERSON stock was largely based on his abilities behind the plate, where he was clearly the best defensive catcher in the 2016 PERSON class. It was enough for the ORGANIZATION to take him in the third round. He lived up to his defensive billing during his first year-plus as a pro and he produced more offensively during his first full season. PERSON included him as part of the package sent to the ORGANIZATION in late August in return for PERSON Verlander.Few doubt ORGANIZATION' ability to make it to the big leagues on his glovework alone. He is an outstanding receiver who moves well behind the plate and works well with pitchers. His plus arm, a combination of solid arm strength with a very quick release and uncanny accuracy, continues to cut down the running game, to the tune of a 46 percent caught stealing rate in 2017. While he may never hit for a high average, ORGANIZATION has always had strength and raw power to tap into. He was on time with his swing much more frequently in 2017, which allowed him to clear fences more consistently. He helps his cause with a willingness to draw walks.At the outset of his pro career, ORGANIZATION looked like he fit the defensive-minded backup profile perfectly. If he keeps swinging the bat like he did in his first full season, it's easy to see him as a glove-first regular in a big league lineup.",1
"PERSON hasn't let the fact that he came from GPE, with no high school baseball team, get in the way of working his way up the ORGANIZATION organizational ladder. The 2011 first-round pick reached Double-A in 2014, at age 21, putting him way ahead of the curve.PERSON's advanced approach at the plate belies his years and his experience. He is extremely patient at the plate, as his career .387 on-base percentage heading into 2015 would attest, and he cut down his strikeout rate quite a bit in 2014, showing an ability to hit to all fields. PERSON has gotten bigger and stronger as he's matured and his power has started to show up a bit more consistently. He's a solid runner with good instincts and his defense has improved in center field, as has his arm. He may have seemed like a long-term project when he was drafted, but PERSON isn't too far off from helping out in GPE's outfield. An ability to play all three spots won't hurt his chances of getting that first callup.",1
"It seems like every year a hitter or two comes out of nowhere and causes quite a ruckus in Lansing. This year it was PERSON, who hit .285/.363/.445 with 50 extra-base hits and 44 steals for the ORGANIZATION. The travel ball circuit is not kind to economically disadvantaged families, and part of the reason PERSON was under-scouted as an amateur, as he told our own PERSON, was because his family could not afford to attend heavily scouted showcases. 
Another reason he may have slid toward the end of the draft was because he was constantly moving around. He was under the international scouting umbrella while he was young and living in the ORGANIZATION, then spent his early high school years in GPE before relocating to GPE for his senior season. It's likely that three separate scouts in each org were responsible for scouting and gauging PERSON's signability. 
The ORGANIZATION got a deal done for $200,000 and PERSON has been a strong early-career performer. Pro scouts see him as a bit of a tweener but think there's a chance he might be an everyday center fielder if absolutely everything comes together. He's not a typical center field sprinter (our sources all have either a 50 or 55 on his speed) but he's instinctive, and fine there for now. If PERSON does move to a corner, his hit/power combination is on the fringe of profiling. A switch-hitter, PERSON has power from the right side of the plate but he's strikeout prone due to a lack of bat control. As a lefty, he has a gap-to-gap approach and good bat control, but not typical over-the-fence thump. 
It's possible that, even with middling offensive ability, PERSON could be such an excellent corner defender that he plays everyday anyway, and his makeup is universally lauded, so we like his chances of reaching and staying in the majors as some kind of role player.",0
"  PERSON had put up solid numbers in rookie ball, then surprised some when he made the full-season LOCATION Power out of Spring Training in 2012. All he did there was lead the circuit in total bases while finishing in the top 10 in a host of offensive categories. PERSON makes consistent contact and can drive the ball to all fields and will use an inside-out swing as well. An outstanding bunter, he also has the strength to show occasional home run power. He has very good speed and is still learning how to use it to his benefit on the basepaths. Defensively, he has the range and the hands to stay at shortstop, but his arm has been erratic. PERSON will stay at shortstop for now, and more people believe he can stay there than they did before his full-season debut, but some feel he'll eventually move over to second base.Bernie PERSON's scouting report Â»",1

"A talented enigma at GPE, PERSON's prodigious stuff was finally deployed with some consistency in 2017 as he struck out a whopping 191 hitters in 141.1 innings. His fastball and curveball are both plus while his changeup, slider and command remain fringey, but fringe command is still more than a grade better than what PERSON showed in college. He's progressing but remains a volatile prospect with #2/3 starter potential",0
"The track record of developing high school catching isn't a particularly good one, with some top picks not making it and others switching positions. PERSON will no doubt be able to stay behind the plate long-term and has the chance to be the kind of all-around backstop to buck that trend.The son of ORGANIZATION head coach PERSON Sr., ORGANIZATION is committed to playing for his father should he head to college. PERSON transferred from his ORGANIZATION high school to play closer to his father for his senior year. He has all the tools to be a very good defender behind the plate, with outstanding catch and throw skills to go along athleticism that allows him to move well. He likes to throw from his knees, and while he can do so effectively, he can fall in love with it as well. Offensively, he has tremendous bat speed and he shows pull power now. A refined approach and continued added strength should help him become a better all-around hitter. There are some issues with his swing, causing some swing and miss.Scouts watched his bat carefully this spring and there are enough who saw the potential there to make him one of the best all-around catching prospects in this year's Draft.",1

ORGANIZATIONw back at ORGANIZATION for his senior season after not coming to terms with the ORGANIZATION, the big right-hander has the chance to be the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick yet again.He has a plus fastball that sits comfortably in the mid-90s with good movement. His hard slider and circle change are both outstanding offerings, at least above-average at times. He can throw all three pitches for strikes and has very good mound presence. The only minor concern is that with that kind of stuff, some scouts feel he doesn't get as many swings and misses as you'd expect, but he still profiles as a top of the rotation starter when all is said and done.In his first three years at ORGANIZATION, two as its Friday night starter, PERSON had gone 18-9 with a 3.22 ERA, striking out 8.11 while allowing 8.41 hits and 2.54 walks per nine.

He also has soft hands and a strong arm.PERSON didn't hit much in his first taste of pro ball, posting a .597 OPS in GPE ball, but PERSON has faith that he will. The ORGANIZATION like his swing and believe he'll develop some gap power. He's an average runner with good baserunning instincts.",0
"GPE ORGANIZATION not only won the ORGANIZATION World Series in 2017, it had a large chunk of its roster taken in the Draft that June. PERSON was the third GPE taken, in the fifth round by the GPE, and he went out and had a very strong pro debut in the GPE League.PERSON began his collegiate career at GPE, but transferred to GPE after redshirting his sophomore year and being told he would be a part-time player. He put up huge numbers with GPE, but might have been dinged by some team's models that discount production at the junior college ranks. At least in his debut, PERSON's approach translated quite nicely to the pro game, making consistent contact and drawing walks in an approach that's still hit over power. A solid athlete with very good range defensively, PERSON has average speed and likes to run. His plus arm will work very well from the hot corner.It appears that PERSON has an exciting package of tools to eventually develop into an everyday third baseman. That's starting with full-season ball and the end result could be one of the better steals of the 2017 Draft.",0
"The move to Double-A can be a challenging one for prospects and how one handles the jump, and the adversity that can often come with it, can be as telling as immediate success. GPE, the junior college standout who went in the fourth round of the 2016 Draft, scuffled with the move to hitter-friendly Reading in 2018, but righted the ship and was pitching very well when an oblique injury ended his season in July.GPE's stuff, and he has a full repertoire of weapons at his disposal, fluctuated at times particularly early in the year. He'll throw both a four- and two-seam fastball and can still get the former up to 95 mph, while he sinks the latter in the low 90s to get groundball outs. The life and deception he uses to throw his fastball allows it to nearly play up to a plus pitch. Both of his breaking balls will flash above-average and he mixes in a cutter to go along with a changeup that is plus at times.At his best, GPE commands his fastball to both sides of the plate and goes right after hitters, something he struggled with in the early going a year ago. PERSON and athletic, he shouldn't need too much more time to be ready for a gig as a mid-rotation starter.",0
"It appears that PERSON is all the way back after August 2011 PERSON surgery. The red-shirt sophomore has been very effective as PERSON's Friday starter. PERSON has a lively fastball that he'll throw up to 95 mph and command well, working quickly and getting many ground-ball outs. His secondary stuff -- a slider and a changeup -- isn't quite as good as his fastball, though both have the chance to develop into consistently PERSON average offerings. With that three-pitch mix and some decent pitchabilitiy, PERSON could be the type of college arm that moves quickly once he's drafted.",0
"We still know very little about PERSON compared to most 22-year-old pitching prospects. He popped up seemingly out of nowhere as a sophomore at a lesser ORGANIZATION junior college but quickly entered the first round discussion when ORGANIZATION ball kicked off in January of 2017. As the draft approached, PERSON was showing better secondary stuff in games and bumping 100 mph in bullpen sessions for scouts. He forced his way up draft boards even though teams had little history with him, and some were skeptical of the new velocity or concerned it would lead to injury. 
PERSON made seven short but dominant appearances in the LOCATION during the summer and was poised to begin 2018 at ORGANIZATION (an aggressive assignment), but he suffered an intercostal strain and began the season on the ORGANIZATION. In his final extended spring rehab start, he was sitting 94-96 and touching 98 with the fastball. He finally toed a ORGANIZATION State League rubber that week and lasted 1.2 innings before a comebacker struck his wrist and forearm and fractured his ulna. The injury ended his regular season after just five outs. 
After rest and some rehab during instructs, PERSON went to GPE for the ORGANIZATION. His stuff was electric there, his fastball always sitting 95-99 and cresting 100 mph often. He threw a 104 mph fastball and a 95 mph slider during the ORGANIZATION game, and he was able to dump his upper-70s curveball in for strikes throughout his six-week tenure, though he threw no changeups. PERSON was also horribly wild at times. It's fair to conclude that rust was to blame for his occasional wildness but because the pro side of the industry has seen so little of PERSON, it's impossible to know for sure. 
There's a strong possibility that he just ends up in the bullpen, but if he does and he breathes one-inning fire like he did during ORGANIZATION, he basically has PERSON's stuff (though perhaps not the same extension or approach angle). Provided he stays healthy, PERSON's future is bright, albeit unclear. He's likely to be handled with care for a while in order to keep him healthy and manage his workload after what was essentially a lost 2018, but given the wide variance and top shelf stuff, there is still frontline starter potential.",0
"PERSON knee issues and constant setbacks kept him off the field for most of last season. When healthy he has a typical right field profile, with power and perhaps some strikeouts. He's a hard working player and GPE's best prospect.",0
"PERSON like PERSON's muscular and projectable body. He has shown plenty of power, but he's also developing into an overall hitter, focusing on avoiding balls out of the strike zone. He's already displayed a polished approach in the batter's box.PERSON's batting practice sessions are a sight to behold, in large part because of the hard, low line drives he sprays all over the field. On defense, PERSON can play all three outfield positions and has shown good instincts. However, his overall skill set might make him best suited for a corner spot. PERSON also like his arm, and he's expected to improve on all parts of his game once he enters an academy and receives professional instruction on a daily basis.A star in GPE's ORGANIZATION, the teenager also impressed in the ORGANIZATION 18U Pan American Championship in 2014. PERSON trains in the ORGANIZATION with PERSON. The ORGANIZATION are the favorite to sign him.",0
"Drafted by his hometown team, GPE took a step forward in 2013, pitching in the ORGANIZATION. He took a step back in 2014 while repeating the Double-A LOCATION, but he landed on the temporary inactive list in late June due to his struggles.When he's on top of his game, GPE has drawn comparisons to PERSON, both for his size and his stuff. He can throw his fastball in the low-90s from a three-quarters arm slot. GPE throws a changeup and a big sweeping curveball, which is his best offspeed pitch. All three of his pitches have a chance to be at least Major League-average offerings.GPE has struggled with his control throughout his professional career, and finding a way to improve it will be critical to his success as a starter in the ORGANIZATION. If he can lower his walk rate, GPE profiles as a middle-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"The ORGANIZATION have one of the best catchers in the big leagues in GPE and one of the top catching prospects in the Minors in GPE. Nevertheless, they couldn't resist the temptation to draft PERSON when he was available with the 52nd pick in the 2014 Draft. The ORGANIZATION USA Player of the ORGANIZATION signed for $1.1 million.PERSON has a mature approach, employs a short stroke and uses the entire field. He makes consistent hard contact and could provide 15 homers per season once he adds some more strength.PERSON's offense stands out more than his defense, though he should be able to stay behind the plate. He has an average arm but still needs to polish his receiving and blocking skills. A top student, PERSON has the work ethic to make the necessary improvements.",0
"PERSON had PERSON surgery as a freshman at ORGANIZATION, returning as a redshirt freshman in 2016 and pitching out of the bullpen. He pitched largely in relief in 2017, mixing in a few starts, and was drafted in the 35th round by the ORGANIZATION. But PERSON opted to return to PERSON to pitch in the rotation for his junior season. He threw well enough to land in the fifth round of the 2018 Draft and while he didn't pitch much in his first summer, he did reach full-season ball, though he was too fatigued to throw at instructs.Big and strong, PERSON has an interesting three-pitch mix to work with, starting with a fastball that touched the mid-90s in his final college season, but sat more at 91-92 over the summer. It has a high spin rate and he can miss bats with it, though he also can keep it down in the zone with sink to elicit ground-ball outs. Both his slider and his changeup flash above-average at times, with his slider the more consistent of the two secondary offerings. PERSON has always been a strike-thrower, but didn't always command the ball well within the zone, leading to a higher hit rate in college than you'd expect given his stuff. That wasn't the case in his small sample size in pro ball, so the A's are intrigued to find out if he can continue that trend over 140-150 innings in a rotation.",0
" A two-sport standout coming from the GPE high school ranks, PERSON has some considerable tools to work with. Most of them are raw, as he's focusing on baseball only for the first time, but it's not like he came to the Brewers with no feel for the game at all. A premium athlete, PERSON has above-average speed that should play well on the basepaths and in center field. Power might not be a huge part of his game, but he has good bat speed that should help him be a decent all-around hitter, perhaps with some extra-base pop. It may take some time, but the Brewers have had some success in developing hitting prospects in the past.",0
"PERSON was the highest-drafted player in GPE Baptist history when the ORGANIZATION made him a seventh-rounder in 2014, lost that distinction when the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in 2016's fourth round but still can become the ORGANIZATION' first big leaguer. He led the Minors in double-play grounders (26) and ranked second in groundout/airout ratio (2.4) in 2016 and spent most of last year in Triple-A, missing two months with an oblique injury. The ORGANIZATION gave up PERSON and PERSON to acquire PERSON and infielder PERSON in a three-team, six-player trade in January.PERSON relies heavily on his heavy sinker, which produced a 2.2 groundout/airout ratio though his first four pro seasons. His two-seam fastball sat around 90 mph in college but now operates at 92-96 mph and he can spot it on either side of the plate. The rest of his repertoire grades as fringy to average, with his changeup more reliable than his cutter or short slider.Though he can't overpower hitters, PERSON goes right after them and refuses to give in. He has walked just 59 batters in 66 pro starts entering 2018 and works deep into games because he keeps his pitch counts low. He has a strong frame an has been very durable (oblique issue aside) since having PERSON surgery in high school, giving him a high floor as an innings eater at the back of a big league rotation.",0
"For the third year in a row, the ORGANIZATION took a high school position player with their first pick in the ORGANIZATION and this time it was PERSON, whom many thought to be the best pure prep hitter in the 2013 ORGANIZATION class. The ORGANIZATION first baseman has the chance to be an above-average hitter and should add more power as he develops. While he's a quality defender at first, he is limited to that position, so how much pop he does add will determine just how well he profiles at the corner infield spot. Most are confident, however, that his bat should carry him to the big leagues.",1
"  PERSONâs name has been on prospect radars for quite some time, going to two Futures Games and being included in the big trade that sent PERSON from the ORGANIZATION to the GPE. The LOCATION is a plus defender across the board, capable of making highlight-reel plays, one who could handle playing defensively in the big leagues immediately. The bigger question is just how much heâll hit. Heâs been a little less productive in Double-A, though he does have a good line-drive type swing and will slash the ball the other way. PERSON has plus speed which not only helps him defensively, but should make him a basestealing threat. If the bat can improve, PERSON could hit at or near the top of the lineup and be an impact player on both sides. Even if it doesnât, seeing PERSON playing ORGANIZATION caliber shortstop while hitting at the bottom of a lineup every day isnât difficult.",0
" The ORGANIZATION of GPE product went straight to Double-A for his first full season and more than held his own. Though he tired a bit by the end of the year, he learned a lot about what it takes to deal with the grind of the long season and rebounded with a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON is an aggressive hitter who doesn't draw many walks, but he also doesn't strike out much. He makes consistent hard contact and has more extra-base power than most expect when they see his small and compact frame. PERSON will use the whole field and has good instincts on the basepaths. He's also a solid defender at second base, and those plus instincts help him in the field as well. He's just about ready to help out in GPE Louis.Bernie Pleskoff's scouting report Â»",1
"When high school pitchers from GPE are discussed, PERSON gets most of the attention in this ORGANIZATION class, but PERSON, a lefty from eastern PA, was generating plenty of his own buzz as the ORGANIZATION approached.The PERSON commit jumped up ORGANIZATION boards this spring as the weather finally improved in the LOCATION, coming out firing fastballs up to 93-94 mph with some sink. The velocity backed up a little as the spring wore on, but the still sat in the 90-92 mph range. His curve has the potential to be a future out pitch with excellent downward action. He shows some feel for the changeup and it, too, has the chance to be a Major League average pitch. PERSON and powerfully built, PERSON will have to work to not get too stiff or muscle-bound, which impacts his ability to control the baseball. PERSON has first-round potential. PERSON doesn't have as much ceiling as his ORGANIZATION State contemporary, but a future as a mid-rotation starter could get him off the board in the top few rounds.",0
"Primarily a reliever at ORGANIZATION, PERSON has pitched almost exclusively as a starter since signing for $1,589,000 as the 16th overall pick in the 2011 Draft. Born in GPE, he has represented PERSON in the ORGANIZATION and the World Baseball Classic, showcasing the upside of a No. 2 or 3 starter.Though PERSON hit 96 mph as a college reliever, he has worked mostly in the 88-to-92-mph range as a pro starter. That's still more than enough velocity to succeed, because his two-seam fastball sinks so much and induces plenty of groundouts. PERSON's spike slider gives him a second plus pitch at times, breaking sharply and arriving in the low 80s.PERSON's slider regressed in 2013, and at times, his sinking changeup was more effective. PERSON's biggest need is to improve his control and command, and he has the athleticism needed to repeat his delivery and locate his pitches better.",0
"A member of the ORGANIZATION of ORGANIZATION' weekend rotation, PERSON was the fourth in seven straight college selections the Phillies made to open the 2014 Draft.Projectable power arms from the college ranks aren't all that common, but PERSON fits that description. Throwing downhill from his 6-foot-4 frame, the right-hander has a live arm that can deliver fastballs in the mid 90s at times, with run and sink as well. PERSON calls his breaking ball a curve, but it's really a slider. It's been inconsistent, but it shows flashes of being an out pitch. His changeup is below average and behind the other two. That, along with his command, are the two things that hold PERSON back as a starting pitching prospect.The jury is out about whether PERSON will remain a starter, but he has the power arsenal to succeed in the bullpen, if that's the direction that makes the most sense.",0
"The younger brother of GPE right-handed pitching prospect PERSON, PERSON could have preceded him in pro ball, but he declined to sign with the ORGANIZATION as a 35th-round pick out of an Idaho high school in 2011. He instead headed to PERSON, where he has been a rotation mainstay since the first weekend of his college career.Like his brother, GPE relies mainly on his arm strength. He maintains a 90-92 mph fastball deep into games and is capable of reaching 95, though his heater is a bit straight.For now, the rest of GPE's arsenal is ordinary. He has some feel for using a three-pitch mix, though neither his curveball nor his changeup is a consistently average pitch. He throws a decent amount of strikes, but his command isn't terribly reliable, so he could wind up as a reliever down the road.",0
"After struggling so much at ORGANIZATION A Asheville that he was demoted to short-season Tri-City in 2012, PERSON returned to the LOCATION League in '13. All he did the second time around was win the ORGANIZATION and the batting title with a .343 average.An improved swing was crucial to PERSON's turnaround. With his mechanics smoother than before, he has begun driving the ball more and tapping into his raw power. PERSON is a switch-hitter and hits for average well from both sides, but his power mostly comes as a left-hander.PERSON has also improved defensively. Still, most scouts believe he will eventually outgrow shortstop. PERSON has played some third base already and could also fit at second base if he does have to change positions.",0
"GPE of a Cathedral program that has produced big leaguers Jake PERSON and PERSON in recent years, GSP is in the mix to become the first high school pitcher drafted in 2015. He had a fine summer on the high school showcase circuit, repeatedly showing one of the more devastating two-pitch combinations in the prep class.Thanks to his fast arm and low-three-quarters slot, GSP imparts a lot of life on his pitches. He usually works at 92-95 mph with his fastball and when he stays on top of his 78-82-mph slider, it's a swing-and-miss offering with bite. With those two weapons in his repertoire, he rarely has needed a changeup against high school competition.His frame, athleticism and long hair draw some comparisons to PERSON, though some scouts wonder if GSP's slinging delivery might make him better suited for the bullpen. After verbally committing to PERSON as a high school freshman, he decommitted last summer and signed with PERSON A&M.",0
"After a stunning GPE debut in 2014 that included a bump up to full-season ball from the ORGANIZATION, PERSON looked like a future starting backstop. The regression that took place in 2015 provided proof that it's hard to develop as a catcher and left the ORGANIZATION scratching their collective heads over what happened.PERSON had trouble getting going all year. While not using it as an excuse, he did battle an ankle issue for much of the season. Previously, he had shown the ability to make consistent hard contact, spraying the ball to all fields, albeit without much power. PERSON plays the game with high energy and effort, which typically shows up in all facets of his game. He still has superior catch-and-throw skills with a plus arm and an ability to shut down the running game, but he struggled with his receiving and blocking at times, too.The ORGANIZATION are hoping PERSON can wipe the slate clean and start over again. They feel if the 22-year-old can get back on track, he has the ability to be a big league regular. Worst-case, he could be a solid defensive-minded backup.",0
" The ORGANIZATION isn't known as a huge baseball conference, but it's had its fair share of GPE prospects, most of them pitchers. PERSON has the chance to be just as good as guys like PERSON, PERSON or PERSON' best attribute might be his arm strength, with the ability to get his fastball up into the mid 90s, though it plays better when he sits in the 92-93 mph range. He has plus action on his curve, though he has trouble commanding it at times. PERSON also throws a cutter-type pitch and a changeup, both of which are below average currently.PERSON' ability to improve his offspeed stuff and his overall command will dictate whether he can start long-term. The team that takes him will likely send him out as a starter, knowing he has the power arsenal that would work well in short relief.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Jan. 21, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON an Underclass 2nd Teamer in both 2015 and 2016, PERSON was targeted by five major college programs before he committed to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON made all-tournament teams in the 2014 ORGANIZATION, 2015 16U PG MLK Championship, 2015 16U PG World Series, 2015 16U ORGANIZATION Championship, and was invited to the 2016 ORGANIZATION. The first thing about the hurler that scouts note is his ultra-strong build. His approach begins from a dead hand start and his swing can sometimes work uphill at the plate, but his strength and leverage give scouts reasons to think he can continue to get better.",0
"If premium defense up the middle is your thing, then PERSON, the 2010 ninth-round pick out of GPE, might be the prospect for you. There is no question PERSON can defend. With outstanding hands, good range and a strong arm, he could probably play shortstop defensively in the big leagues right now. He also showed the ability to slide over to second in 2014 and play well there, as top prospect PERSON was sharing time at both spots with PERSON. It's PERSON's bat that has always been the concern. A free swinger who doesn't draw many walks, he does show some ability to hit the ball to all fields with some gap power, something he started to do consistently in Double-A in 2015 to earn a promotion up a level.His glove will get him to the big leagues. How much his bat continues to develop will dictate if he can be an everyday shortstop or perhaps a slick-fielding utilityman.",1
"Injuries have plagued PERSON since college. His back, his elbow, a Tommy PERSON, more back, the shoulder, more elbow. The ORGANIZATION pared down his repertoire and transitioned him into a multi-inning relief role fairly early in 2018. He was shut down with injury in July. In the fall, his velocity was back in the mid-90s but his secondary stuff wasn't as crisp. PERSON injured list stints early in his career, PERSON would flash No. 3 starter stuff. There's a chance that comes back, but the injury history is suppressing how he's viewed compared to other prospects and will likely impact the way PERSON develops him, as evidenced by the 2018 bullpen move.",0
"  PERSON ended his prolific career at FACILITY A&M with back-to-back Big 12 batting titles and was drafted 15th overall in 2012. He started his professional career quickly and was named to the All-Prospect Team in the ORGANIZATION after his first full professional season. PERSON has been slowed by injuries the last two years, totaling just 160 games because of a broken hand, quadriceps and hip strains and a concussion.Throughout his career, PERSON has hit wherever he has gone. His feel for the barrel and his quick wrists enable him to make a lot of contact and hit line drives to all fields. He widened his stance as a professional, allowing him to hit for a bit more power, but his game is still more about getting on base and using his speed. Beginning with PERSON, the ORGANIZATION used three straight first-round picks on center fielders. That makes for a crowded organizational depth chart, but his above-average arm, speed and instincts make him a fit anywhere in the outfield.",0
"PERSON started on PERSON's 2016 College World Series runner-up team but didn't start making an impact at the plate until he batted .376 in the ORGANIZATION that summer, falling a few plate appearances shy of winning the batting title. He encored by leading the Pacific-12 Conference with a .383 average and ORGANIZATION Division I with a school-record 30 doubles last spring. After signing for $700,000 as a supplemental second-round choice received from the ORGANIZATION as punishment for a hacking scandal, he scuffled in his pro debut but has produced as expected during his first full season.PERSON got away from his normal approach in his introduction to pro ball and began hitting for average and power once he reverted to what worked for him in the past. He's doing a better job working counts in 2018 and has generated some of the best exit velocities among GPE farmhands. His pop comes naturally because he's strong and his left-handed swing creates plenty of bat speed and loft.Though he has an average arm, PERSON lacks speed and quickness and thus much defensive value. PERSON utilized him mostly as a first baseman and ORGANIZATION, while PERSON initially deployed him in left field, where he'll be adequate at best.",0
"PERSON made his big league debut on June 23, two years to the day after he signed for $100,000 as a seventh-round pick out of PERSON. He had four stints with the ORGANIZATION, allowing a run in just one of his first eight appearances before he faded down the stretch and got left off GPE's wild-card roster.Unlike most relievers, PERSON has three effective pitches. His best offering is his fastball, which sits at 92-94 mph and can reach as high as 98. His curveball features power and depth, and he has developed a changeup with splitter action.PERSON battled the strike zone in college at PERSON but hasn't had much trouble throwing strikes as a pro. He relied heavily on his changeup during his time in the big leagues, rather than challenging hitters with his superior fastball and curveball. If he learns to trust his stuff, he could become a setup man down the road.",1
"No high school right-hander has gone No. 1 overall in the GPE, but GPE was a legitimate contender. He's the best mound prospect to come out of ORGANIZATION since PERSON's PERSON made a run at the top pick in 2005, and a lock to be the state's first prep pitcher taken in the first round since GPE Holman in 1983. GPE led PERSON (ORGANIZATION) to the ORGANIZATION state 5-A championship, striking out 12 in a quarterfinal victory and hitting the game-winning two-run double in the title game.GPE has an electric arm and added 15 pounds of muscle during the offseason, boosting his fastball velocity to a consistent 93-97 mph and a high of 102 this spring. He throws a power curveball that already is a plus pitch and can turn it into a harder slider when he wants. The ORGANIZATION State recruit presently has little need for a changeup, though his has good fade and gives him another plus offering when he needs one.While GPE has a huge ceiling, he does come with some risk. He lacks consistency with his mechanics, sometimes finding it difficult to repeat his arm slot and find the strike zone. There's some effort in GPE's delivery, leading to some concerns about his future command.",0
"Scouts have always liked PERSON' combination of solid stuff and command, even if his results at ORGANIZATION State were mixed, and the ORGANIZATION were definitely enthused with his pro mindset when he joined the organization.PERSON has always had a good arm, and PERSON has helped him clean up his delivery so that he can pitch downhill more. That should help him use his three-pitch mix more effectively. PERSON will throw a two-seam and a four-seam fastball, complementing those with a Major League-average slider and changeup.With his polish and firm sense of a game plan, PERSON has shown the ability to handle an aggressive assignment, and the ORGANIZATION hope he will be the kind of college arm that doesn't take too long to get to the big leagues.",1
" After an exciting full-season debut in 2011, PERSON's numbers took a step back when he moved up to Double-A in 2012 as he admittedly tried to do too much when he struggled. He did have some stretches of success, then finished things off with a solid ORGANIZATION campaign. PERSON's best tool is his plus speed, which allows him to be a terrific center fielder as well as a major basestealing threat, though he needs to learn to be more efficient on the basepaths. He has an understanding that his job is to be a catalyst at the top of the lineup, one who can get on base and let his speed work for him. He has a line-drive swing with some extra-base power. With PERSON signed to a four-year deal, PERSON's path to GPE isn't as clear, though he did play some left field in the AFL.Bernie Pleskoff's scouting report Â»",0
" One thing is certain about this tall, lanky GPE right-hander: He can really throw hard. He has a true plus fastball that has touched triple digits on more than one occasion. He does throw the fastball for strikes fairly consistently, especially for his age. Heâs not just arm strength. PERSON has a good sinking changeup that should be an above-average pitch in the future. Whether he can stay in a rotation or have to move to the bullpen might depend on how his big, slurvy breaking ball develops over time. If he can tighten it up, he has the size, stuff and overall feel for pitching to start. If not, that fastball-changeup combination should work well in relief.",0
" ORGANIZATION became a prospect of interest when he hit .356 as a sophomore at ORGANIZATION to earn a first-team All-Big LOCATION nod. He certainly didn't hurt his stock any by hitting well in the ORGANIZATION over the summer and he's continued to be that solid performer in his junior season with the ORGANIZATION. ORGANIZATION's loudest tool is his bat, with an advanced approach and line-drive oriented spring. He does have good bat speed and some raw power to tap into, though he hasn't done so yet collegiately. He has solid average speed and good instincts on the basepaths. Where the main divergence in opinion about ORGANIZATION is where he profiles defensively. Some feel he can stay in center long-term, which obviously improves his profile. Others think he'll have to move to left or would profile best as a fourth outfielder. As a college performer who has, well, performed, ORGANIZATION's stock has at least held steady, if not risen, during his junior season. A team that thinks he can stick in center could be the one that takes him in the top three rounds, where he'll try to join outfielder PERSON, a 2012 draftee, as the most recent ORGANIZATION to reach the big leagues.",0
"The PERSON made PERSON their eighth-round pick in June 2015, and then gave him $400,000 to forgo his commitment to PERSON A&M. His dominance as an amateur carried over to his professional debut in the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, and PERSON built on that performance during his 2016 full-season debut. The ORGANIZATION acquired the right-hander for PERSON on June 30 -- while in the midst of a stretch that saw him toss three straight hitless outings of five innings --- only to have to shut him down with a forearm strain that required PERSON surgery in GPE and cost him all of 2017. When healthy, PERSON has an impressive combination of stuff and feel. An uptick in velocity in 2015 pushed his fastball into the 92-95 mph range in his pro debut, and he's adept at locating it to both sides of the plate. PERSON's changeup is a double-plus pitch and easily his best secondary offering, thrown with convincing arm action and outstanding tumble. He made strides with his breaking ball before undergoing surgery, throwing it with greater depth and sharper bite, giving him a promising arsenal of three average-or-better pitches. The right-hander uses his height to create good plane toward the plate, and it's only going to improve as he adds strength and gains better control of his core.PERSON returned to the mound late last season during fall instruction league and began his 2018 season in late April in the GPE, where he posted a 2.24 ERA with 84 strikeouts and four walks over 10 starts to earn a promotion to Double-A. He will need to refine his command and continue to improve his breaking ball, not to mention address ongoing concerns about his durability, but PERSON has the necessary ingredients to develop into a No. 3 or 4 starter if it all comes together.",1
"PERSON was part of the ORGANIZATION' July 2 international signing class in 2014, agreeing to a deal for $50,000. But he joined the ORGANIZATION two years later in the trade that sent PERSON to GPE, and he made an impact immediately. PERSON's 2017 organizational debut was a strong one. Splitting time between Class A Fort Wayne and Class A Advanced Lake ORGANIZATION in 2017, PERSON led all ORGANIZATION farmhands with 170 strikeouts, and he needed just 129 innings to do so. He posted a 3.70 ERA as a 20-year-old.PERSON racked up more gaudy strikeout totals in '18 at ORGANIZATION before making the jump to Double-A ORGANIZATION for the '19 season. He was even promoted to the ORGANIZATION for a spot start in GPE, where he pitched 5 1/3 innings of one-run ball in GPE. A couple weeks later, however, PERSON experienced a right-elbow sprain and was shut down at ORGANIZATION to rehab the injury.A slightly undersized right-hander, PERSON pitches with average fastball velocity, typically sitting at 92-93 mph. His plus curveball is a swing-and-miss offering, one thrown by design with varying velocities but consistent shape and action. His a changeup, which sits in the low 80s with plenty of movement, gets whiffs and weak contact, too. He has a good feel for all three pitches, albeit with slightly below-average command. PERSON's ceiling is probably as a back-of-the-rotation starter, but his arsenal is already advanced enough to get big league hitters out.",1
"It's certainly not uncommon to have the ORGANIZATION batting champ rated highly for the next year's Draft. When that batting champion is almost certainly going to be drafted to pitch, that is a little more unusual, yet that is exactly where GPE appears to be headed.GPE has been a successful two-way player during his career at ORGANIZATION, hitting for average and showing excellent athleticism in the outfield while displaying premium velocity on the mound. The right-hander had started some over his first two years of college, but has pitched exclusively out of the ORGANIZATION' bullpen as a junior, and he's done it well with a fastball that consistently has touched 96-97. He'll flash a plus slider that he will add to and subtract from so it looks like a curve at times. He doesn't use his changeup much, but he has one that could improve with more work.There is some effort in GPE's delivery, leading some to wonder if he can repeat it consistently enough to start. But he does throw strikes, has three potential pitches and athleticism on his side, so a team considering him in the opening rounds could send him out as a starter and see how it goes once he's focusing on pitching full-time.",0
"Undrafted out of high school and after his first year at FACILITY (ORGANIZATION.) ORGANIZATION, PERSON went 17th overall in June 2013 after leading PERSON junior college players in hitting (.495) and on-base percentage (.568). Signed for $2,164,000, he went straight to low Class A, and he looked like he belonged. PERSON has continued to make progress in his first full pro season this year, though he was sidelined when an errant pitch broke his right wrist in late June.PERSON was known more as a point guard at GPE (Ala.) High, which he led to a 6A basketball state championship in 2011, yet he has advanced instincts at the plate. He understands the value of working counts to get on base, where he can use his well-above-average speed to put pressure on the defense. PERSON has a quick bat and some wiry strength, so he could develop some gap power.Leading up to the 2013 Draft, some scouts projected PERSON more as a center fielder than a shortstop, but the FACILITY Sox have no plans to move him off his current position. PERSON has the actions, range and arm to play short, and he has the work ethic to make the necessary refinements.",1
"PERSON has a four-pitch mix and generates plus-plus extension, which makes his mid-90s fastball play up. We have his 2018 breaking ball spin rate on The ORGANIZATION because this year's are way, way down, likely due to injury.",0
"PERSON's sinking mid-90s fastball and curveball don't play that well off of one another and he may not miss as many bats as one might expect given each pitch's pure nastiness. But he should induce a ton of ground balls, throw a high ratio of strikes, and pitch in the middle of GPE's rotation for many years.",1
" The ORGANIZATION made PERSON, the son of former All-Star closer PERSON, the 22nd-overall pick in 2013, and he carved up hitters in the Class A GPE ORGANIZATION during his full-season debut in 2014 at the age of 19. But PERSON was shut down with a right elbow strain later that season, and it was the same injury that sidelined him for all of 2015. He returned to the mound for the first time in nearly two years in 2016 only to leave his fifth start with elbow discomfort that required PERSON surgery. PERSON has since worked is way back from the injury, and he logged his first affiliated game action in over a year in July. When healthy, PERSON has a three-pitch mix to miss a lot of bats. His fastball sits in the low 90s and touches 94-96 mph consistently, and he commands the pitch to both sides of the plate thanks to a smooth delivery as well as loose, clean arm action. His curveball is a legitimate out pitch with plus-plus potential, thrown with tight spin and considerable depth, and he shows the makings of an average changeup. Meanwhile, his average control and command allows his entire arsenal to play up.  The ORGANIZATION' primary objective is to make sure the right-hander has a normal, healthy offseason. Still just 22, PERSON has time on his side, and club officials believe he's now better off physically after going through a structured strengthening and throwing program.",0
"A $65,000 senior sign as a ORGANIZATION sixth-round pick out of GPE in 2013, PERSON dominated as a reliever in his pro debut and showed promise as a starter in his first full season. But he has had trouble staying healthy since, missing all of 2015 after tearing his left Achilles tendon, the last three months of 2016 with a right forearm strain and the final month of last season with a torn right flexor tendon. He's not expected to return to the mound until June and will do so in the ORGANIZATION system after getting traded with fellow righty prospect GPE for PERSON and $750,000 in international bonus pool money in December.PERSON has a quick arm that produces consistent mid-90s fastballs when he works in relief. He can touch 100 mph and has some armside run on his heater. His hard slider is his best secondary pitch and he'll mix in a curveball as well. He also has a changeup from his days as a starter but doesn't use it as much coming out of bullpen.The ORGANIZATION made PERSON a full-time reliever in 2017, and he was pushing for a big league promotion when he got hurt again in GPE. His control has slipped since he began dealing with the rash of injuries, but he could fill a late-inning role if he stays healthy and delivers more strikes.",0
"Signed for $500,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2010, GPE had been one of the youngest and most productive hitters in every league he had played in until he got to high Class A last season. After he hit .193/.275/.326 in the first half, he rebounded after a demotion and helped PERSON win the low Class A ORGANIZATION championship.A switch-hitter, GPE makes hard contact from both sides of the plate and shows more power as a left-handed hitter. He generally controls the strike zone well, though he went through stretches in 2014 where he was alternately too passive or overly aggressive. The ORGANIZATION believe he learned from adversity and will continue to fit the offensive profile at third base.The silver lining in GPE's offensive struggles is that he didn't let them affect his defense. In fact, he worked harder than ever on his glove and improved his long-term chances of remaining at the hot corner. He's not especially quick for a third baseman, but he does have the hands and arm strength for the position.",1
"PERSON was a solid performer over the summer, as a skinny kid with an advanced glove and good feel for contact. He added weight over the summer and still projects to play short, but now has double digit homer power and the strength to make more consistent contact.",0
"PERSON entered 2016 with PERSON comparisons and a chance to go early in the first round, but he slumped as an GPE junior and actually performed better on the mound, leading all pitchers with 41 strikeouts during the ORGANIZATION Division I tournament. The ORGANIZATION still bought into his power potential and signed him for an over-slot $650,000 bonus in the fourth round. An old hamate injury ruined his first full pro season, but he bounced back in 2018 to rank second in the Minors in extra-base hits (70) and ORGANIZATION (109), and fourth in homers (32).PERSON comes with serious pop and serious swing-and-miss concerns -- as evidenced by his .301 PERSON and 32-percent strikeout rate last season. Few prospects anywhere have more raw power, which he creates with an impressive combination of bat speed, strength and launch angle, not to mention an extremely aggressive approach. He shows some patience to draw walks and is at his best when he uses the middle of the field, though he often sells out for home runs, lengthens his right-handed swing and chases pitches out of the zone.While PERSON has below-average speed, he has worked hard to make himself into a solid defender at third base. His range is ordinary, but he has good hands and a strong arm that delivered low-90s fastballs and effective sliders in college. Because they also have PERSON in GPE and PERSON in Triple-A, the ORGANIZATION began exposing PERSON to first base in 2018.",0
"It's amazing what some strength and conditioning can do. Initially a diminutive glove-only shortstop when he signed in 2012, PERSON has been through the organization's strength program twice. The result was a breakout 2015 season that saw him make the LOCATION League All-Star Team and earn a promotion.There are some who feel PERSON is the best defensive shortstop in the system, high praise considering J.P. Crawford's presence. PERSON has all the tools to play the premium position at a high level, with a plus arm, glove and range. His 60 speed on the scouting scale allows him to have excellent range and makes him a basestealing threat. His offensive tools all play up now thanks to that added strength. He can drive the ball to the right-center-field gap with authority and his 40 extra-base hits show that he no longer will have the bat knocked out of his hands.PERSON still has a ways to go in terms of refining his approach and improving his offensive game. But he's headed in the right direction and now looks like he has the chance to be an everyday shortstop at the big league level.",0
"A former two-sport star at GPE (Calif.) High, PERSON was selected by the ORGANIZATION in the second round of the 2012 Draft and signed for $750,000. He made his full-season debut the following year and moved up to Class A Advanced PERSON in 2014, where, at age 20, he paced the ORGANIZATION State League with 36 doubles while also stealing 22 bases. His performance was less consistent last season at ORGANIZATION, and his struggles continued during his return to the LOCATION in 2016.PERSON is both athletic and toolsy, with an overall feel for the game that has long impressed evaluators given his multi-sport background. A right-handed hitter, he has good bat speed, advanced bat-to-ball skills and a knack for pounding the gaps. The ORGANIZATION tried to get him to generate more power last season by adjusting his setup and stride, though it only detracted from his natural hitting ability. PERSON's best tool is his above-average speed, but he's still learning how to be an efficient basestealer. His speed also serves him well in center field, where he's an instinctual defender with good range.Though he took a step back last season in Double-A, the ORGANIZATION believe he'll make the necessary adjustments to push through those struggles. He still has a chance to develop into a big league regular in center field, though scouts seem to be a bit more leery after his drop-off in production at the Double-A level.",0
"Though he's just an average runner without the silky smooth hands typically associated with the position, PERSON has an above average arm and good defensive feet that might allow him to play there long term. He also has plus bat speed and above average pull power, though PERSON is vulnerable against breaking balls on the outer half. He has a chance to play short and hit for some power and scouts think the bat might profile at third or second should he have to move.",0
" An athletic, toolsy outfielder when the ORGANIZATION drafted him in 2012, PERSON turned that promise into production in a breakout 2014 season. He was named the ORGANIZATION of the Year after posting a .905 ORGANIZATION, collecting 153 hits and scoring 87 runs in 130 games between Class A Quad Cities and Class A Advanced Lancaster. The following July, he was the headline prospect in a four-player package that PERSON sent to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON, PERSON and 2015-16 international bonus pool money. In his first two years in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON looked more like a top-of-the-order hitter, thanks to his patience, contact-oriented approach and speed. He tweaked his swing in 2014, allowing him to tap into newfound power, and he hit 17 home runs after not homering in his first two years as a professional. He's also an above-average runner, giving him an intriguing power-speed combination. PERSON' speed gives him a chance to stick in center field, though some scouts think he's better suited defensively for right field. His strong arm will profile at either position.",1
"The ORGANIZATION reportedly offered PERSON a $1.5 million bonus in 2014 after drafting him in the first round, only to pull it off the table when PERSON. 1 overall pick PERSON's deal collapsed and the club no longer could afford PERSON with its reduced bonus pool. Both pitchers wound up with ORGANIZATION's (PERSON, Fla.) post-graduate program and were drafted once again in 2015, with PERSON going to GPE in the third round and signing for $900,000. He made strides on all fronts during his full-season debut, showing improved velocity, stuff and stamina, qualities that have followed him up the ladder to Class A Advanced Lake Elsinore in 2017.The Padres helped PERSON clean up his delivery late that season, and those adjustments have made him more consistent on all fronts. He sits 92-95 mph while reaching 97 with his fastball, all while showing increasing comfort with repeating his delivery. PERSON also made strides with his curveball, throwing it with more depth and sharper downward action that makes it a plus pitch in the eyes of evaluators. His changeup should at least be average, and he's adept at throwing strikes with all three pitches..PERSON answered questions about his durability last season by logging 105 innings as a 20-year-old, and he has plenty of room left to grow into his athletic and projectable frame. He's a potential PERSON. 3 starter in the big leagues, especially if the changeup and his command continue to improve.",1
"PERSON was supposed to head to GPE, but had his roster spot and scholarship rescinded, so he walked on at GPE and started as a freshman when PERSON got hurt. This season, as a junior, he upped his offensive profile to his strong defensive game to land in the third round and get full pick value from the ORGANIZATION.There's no question about PERSON's defensive ability, with excellent catch and throw skills. His above-average arm plays up even more because of his quick release and accuracy. He moves well behind the plate and works very well with pitchers. An improved approach at the plate allowed PERSON to be GPE's best hitter in 2017, showing some extra-base ability from the right side of the plate.If PERSON can continue to show a more consistent bat, he has the chance to be a glove-first regular, something the ORGANIZATION clearly are hoping for. At worst, though, he should be a very solid backup at the big league level.",0
"ORGANIZATION used PERSON exclusively as a reliever on teams that went to the ORGANIZATION World Series finals in 2014 and 2015 (winning it all in his freshman year), and he dominated out of the bullpen while earning co-playoff ORGANIZATION honors in the ORGANIZATION in the latter summer. The ORGANIZATION tried him as a starter at the beginning of his junior season before shifting him back to the bullpen as a closer. The ORGANIZATION eased him into pro ball in short stints after signing him for $1.6 million as a second-rounder.As a lefty with three pitches and a durable frame, PERSON has the ingredients to pitch in the middle of a big league rotation. His 90-95 mph fastball plays up because it has late life and steep downhill plane. He also shows feel for a sinking changeup and has a three-quarters breaking ball that fluctuates between a low-80s slider and a high-70s curveball.Colorado is still undecided about PERSON's long-term role. Though he could move quickly as a possible high-leverage reliever, he also has mid-rotation potential and a fresh arm that logged just 96 1/3 innings in three seasons at ORGANIZATION. His control and command improved steadily during his college career, but to make it as a starter he'll have to show that he can maintain a quality fastball into the late innings.",0
"PERSON has a frame and profile reminiscent of Cubs 1B/DH prospect PERSON and many scouts were lukewarm on him last summer, but PERSON lost a few pounds and mashed against pro pitchers, getting to his easy plus raw power while player forthe GPE Junior National team that toured PERSON.",1
"As a college football player at ORGANIZATION who didn't return to baseball until his senior year of college, winning the Big East Triple Crown in the process, PERSON has followed one of the more unusual paths to pro ball. He went from the fourth round of the 2012 Draft to Triple-A in three years in the ORGANIZATION system, then joined the ORGANIZATION in December as the player to be named in the deal that sent PERSON to GPE. While he might be older than the average prospect at his level, he's not, in terms of experience. The more he's played, the more rust PERSON has knocked off to reach Triple-A in 2015. His approach at the plate is a bit unorthodox, but he continues working to smooth out rough edges along the way. His move to Triple-A marked the first time he didn't hit for both average and power. PERSON is a good athlete who is an average runner, and the ORGANIZATION have given him looks at third, where he started his career, first and the outfield. He might be best suited in left field or at first, where he's been better than anticipated. After spending most of his first three pro seasons at third base, PERSON saw most of his action in 2015 in the outfield and first base. He's a good athlete with average speed, but his fringy arm strength and range limit his defensive value. He earns raves for his makeup, which, along with his power, should help him find his way to the big leagues in the near future.",0
"There might not have been another college arm who shot up ORGANIZATION boards more than this ORGANIZATION ace during the spring. His rise slowed a bit with some struggles, perhaps caused by fatigue, in April. But he still has the size, stuff and command to potentially be a frontline starter at the highest level. PERSON's fastball will touch 97 mph and is consistently at least above average with good sink. He throws a nasty slider, and his changeup projects to be a legitimate weapon as well.PERSON has above-average control and command and the ideal athletic frame scouts love to see in a pitcher. There's room for gaining strength, which gives him a high ceiling as well.",0
"After pitching with an upper-80s fastball on the showcase circuit last summer, PERSON dedicated himself to getting stronger in the offseason. His work paid off when he came out touching 93 mph early this spring and held his improved velocity throughout his senior season. He could go as early as the third round and figures to get picked high enough to sign him away from an Ohio State commitment.PERSON now operates in the low 90s early in games and should throw a bit harder as he continues to develop physically. He can flash a good curveball at times but it's below average at others and he can't always land it in the strike zone. He shows some feel for his changeup, which has fade and should become an effective third pitch.PERSON is athletic and has a clean delivery, so he should be able to iron out the inconsistencies with his control and command. Though he's not especially tall, he uses a high-three-quarters arm slot to create downhill plane on his pitches.",0
"Extremely projectable and athletic, PERSON could prove to be a steal as a ninth-rounder from the 2012 Draft. The ORGANIZATION thought enough of him to send him to low Class A as an 18-year-old to open '13, and while he struggled at first, he fared better once he returned there in mid-August after a demotion.PERSON generates easy velocity on his fastball, working from 90 to 95 mph and showing the ability to cut and sink the pitch. All three of his secondary pitches have the potential to become average or better down the road, with his curveball currently rating ahead of his slider and changeup.PERSON will need to do a better job of trusting his stuff as he advances. He's also working on smoothing out his delivery so he can throw more strikes. PERSON is still just 19, so he has plenty of time.",0
"So young is PERSON that he had to wait almost two months after the July 2 signing day to turn 16 and become eligible to put pen to paper on his pro contract, which included a $1 million bonus. He's a typical, frame-based projection outfield prospect at a lean, high-waisted, broad-shouldered 6-foot-2. His upright swing is currently suited for high-ball contact but, based on the GPE propensity for enacting swing changes, that will likely change pretty quickly. As he grows into his body and better incorporates his lower half into his swing, he could have serious in-game power at maturity. Likely a long-term developmental project, PERSON may not be stateside for actual games until the 2020 AZL.",0
"Though PERSON was a catcher when he signed for $45,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2013, he spent the majority of his first three pro seasons at third base before moving behind the plate full-time last year. Despite the increased defensive responsibilities, he finished second in the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION in doubles (35) and slugging (.489) and slammed a pair of homers in the playoffs to help GPE win the championship. He broke a bone in his right thumb when he was hit by a pitch in GPE Training this year, missing most of the season's first month before reporting to high Class A.PERSON's offense is ahead of his defense. He's strong and makes consistent hard contact from the right side of the plate, though his lack of patience could be exploited by more advanced pitchers as he rises through the Minors. Most of his power comes to his pull side and he might generate more if he adds some loft to his swing and hits fewer ground balls.PERSON is still a work in progress as a catcher, especially in terms of his receiving and game-calling. He has a strong arm but inconsistent footwork creates inaccurate throws at times. For now, he profiles as an offensive-minded backup capable of filling in on the infield corners.",0
"He can't match PERSON's loud tools or his ceiling, but PERSON outhit him on the same teams in 2014 and 2015. Though he won't displace PERSON as the ORGANIZATION' shortstop of the future, PERSON has enough all-around ability to claim a utility role in GPE. His play in the ORGANIZATION in 2015 earned him a spot on the 40-man roster, and he has kept it heading into 2017.A switch-hitter, PERSON has tremendous hand-eye coordination that makes him one of the best contact hitters in the system. He drives the ball more from the right side of the plate, but he isn't a power threat by any means, and he'll likely will fit at the bottom of a big league batting order. PERSON is an average runner who won't steal many bases.While he may make only modest offensive contributions, PERSON' defensive versatility enhances his value. He has the range and arm strength to be a solid shortstop. At second base, he's a plus defender with quick hands made for turning double plays, and he also can get the job done at the hot corner.",1
"When the A's acquired PERSON in December 2011 as a part of the trade that sent PERSON and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION, he had just celebrated his 19th birthday and was coming off an impressive stateside debut. He emerged as one of GPE's better pitching prospects in 2013 and moved up to Double-A the following year, only to have his season all but wiped out by PERSON surgery in May. He returned to the mound last June at ORGANIZATION A Advanced GPE, but was held to a strict 60-pitch/four-inning limit as he continued to work his way back from surgery.PERSON's velocity was down during his initial starts at GPE, but, by the end of the season, the right-hander was back sitting in the 92-95 mph range and bumping 96 with his fastball. His changeup has above-average potential and complements his fastball well, and he'll also mix in a show-me curveball. His slider was inconsistent but showed the makings of becoming a third average-or-better offering up until he blew out his elbow. The A's didn't have him throw it in 2015, though, as they instead emphasized building up arm strength and regaining feel. Throwing strikes has never been a problem for PERSON, who has walked just 1.9 batters per nine innings as a professional.PERSON returned to PERSON in 2016 but was inconsistent across his starts for GPE. He began to show signs of finally turning the corner in late July, which is when the A's promoted him to Triple-A. The right-hander had made significant strides in the year before his injury, and if he's able to fully recapture that ability and develop a more consistent breaking ball, he has a chance to become a solid Major League starter.",1
"King stood out as one of the best pitchers at the World Wood Bat Association World Championship last October, generating buzz as a potential first-rounder. He hasn't quite lived up to that billing this spring, though his powerful right arm still has attracted plenty of attention and helped keep GPE (GPE) atop the national high school rankings for much of the year until the ORGANIZATION lost in the state 6-A regional semifinals.After King threw several 94-95 mph fastballs at the ORGANIZATION event, scouts hoped he'd pitch there more consistently as a senior but he has worked mostly at 89-93. With his projectable frame and his quick arm, he eventually could operate in the mid-90s and approach 100 mph. His heater has running and sinking action that generates groundouts when he keeps it down in the zone.King's slider also was harder and sharper last fall but still shows flashes of becoming a solid offering. The ORGANIZATION recruit shows aptitude for a changeup with some fade as well. There's some effort in his delivery and he lands with a stiff front leg, which could compromise his health and his command and eventually lead him to the bullpen.",0
"GPE forces scouts to project heavily on his secondary stuff, and not everyone thinks he'll be able to develop an especially effective breaking ball. But he has elite velocity, prototypical size and the athleticism and fluidity to at least project on his changeup and command pretty significantly.",0
"A GPE PERSON drafted in the second round by the D-backs out of a GPE high school in 2014, PERSON won ORGANIZATION honors in the Rookie-level PERSON in 2015 before getting traded to the ORGANIZATION in a deal for PERSON the following January. He led the Class A ORGANIZATION with 20 homers in his first season in the ORGANIZATION organization but slumped in his second, then got dealt to the ORGANIZATION as part of a package for eventual ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION PERSON. He struggled again at the plate in 2018, batting .232/.340/.399 between Double-A and Triple-A, but still has more offensive upside than most middle infielders.PERSON's best attribute is his plus raw power, with his bat speed and the strength in his compact frame translating into hard-hit balls to all fields. He can get aggressive at times but his hand-eye coordination and patience should have translated into better than a .254 career average in his first five pro seasons. He did make some adjustments last year to reduce the uppercut in his left-handed stroke but they didn't produce noticeably better results.PERSON needs to reach his offensive potential to make it as a big league regular because he doesn't stand out in other aspects of the game. While he has good instincts on the bases, his average speed doesn't make him much of a threat to steal. Signed as a shortstop, he gets the job done at second base but his average arm limits his usefulness on the left side of the infield.",1
"First of all, PERSON has the durable and athletic frame evaluators seek in starting pitcher prospects. He also features a lot more.The young right-hander has an easy, repeatable delivery paired with a loose and under-control arm action. He has shown the ability to throw strikes and his mix of three quality pitches stands out for a player his age. PERSON's fastball usually sits in the 90 mph range for multiple innings and he has been up to 92 mph with good command. More velocity could be on the way as he grows and his body develops. PERSON's curveball sits in the low 70s with depth and good tempo and his change hovers in the low 80s with some arm-side fade. Overall, his present pitch abilities and stuff combined with body projection has some scouts believing PERSON has middle-of-the-rotation upside. He's a competitor that also known for his good makeup. He's confident on the mound. He is trained by PERSON in the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON ORGANIZATION and PERSON weren't the only pitchers who drew scouts to the ORGANIZATION in GPE, Fla., last spring. While the two aforementioned hurlers pitched for ORGANIZATION's post-graduate program, PERSON emerged as a star for the high school squad. But signability concerns caused him to fall to the eighth round of the 2015 Draft, where the ORGANIZATION were able to lure him away from a GPE commitment with a $725,000 bonus. He was excellent in his abbreviated pro debut, and then was shipped off to the ORGANIZATION as part of the ORGANIZATION trade in November. In 2016, PERSON had continued to make strides during full-season debut with PERSON before landing on the disabled list in early June with left elbow soreness.PERSON's prospect stock took off last spring behind an uptick in velocity that pushed his formerly below-average fastball into the 90-94 mph range. His heater has good life, too, which makes it difficult for opponents to barrel. PERSON's arsenal of secondary pitches is equally impressive, as his slider, curveball and changeup all have the potential to be average or better once fully developed.PERSON's advanced feel for pitching made for an easy transition to the professional ranks, and he showed the ability to throw each of his four pitches for strikes in his debut. PERSON may not have the ceiling of some of the other young pitchers in the ORGANIZATION' system, but, with his pitchability and strong command profile, he could be the first to reach the ORGANIZATION.",1
"PERSON doesn't have the stuff to match likely-top-10 picks PERSON (ORGANIZATION) and J.B. Bukauskas (LOCATION) or possible first-rounder PERSON (GPE), but he held his own against all three of them in well-scouted matchups this spring. Though he has a fringy fastball, he has enough craftiness as a left-handed starter to factor in the top five rounds of the draft. His younger brother PERSON was a redshirt on the ORGANIZATION' national champion football team in the fall. PERSON can carve up hitters with his changeup, a plus offering that he sells with deceptive arm speed and bottoms out at the plate. He has a pair of average breaking balls that he locates well, a mid-70s curveball with depth and a low-80s cutter/slider. His 86-88 mph fastball peaks at 91 and grades as his worst pure pitch, though it's effective because he sinks and commands it well and delivers it with good angle.While PERSON has always thrown strikes, he has little margin for error and didn't thrive as a college starter until he bolstered his command this spring. PERSON love his cerebral approach to pitching and his competitiveness, which enhances his chances of making it as a back-of-the-rotation starter.",0
"PERSON (Ga.) PERSON has produced a pair of big league infielders in GPE Treadway and PERSON, and it may have a third on the way in PERSON. He's PERSON's best prospect since PERSON and profiles as more of an impact hitter than the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in the 2008 PERSON has become.PERSON has the tools and approach to hit for power and average. He offers bat speed, strength and patience from the left side of the plate. He uses the entire field and has better pitch recognition than most high schoolers.Currently a shortstop, PERSON will move to a less challenging position at the next level. The ORGANIZATION recruit has good hands but lacks the quickness to play in the middle infield. His arm hasn't been as strong this spring, when he has dealt with biceps tendinitis, but it and his bat would profile well at third base.",0
"GPE of a crazy-deep ORGANIZATION high school pitching crop in 2016 -- PERSON went fourth overall to the ORGANIZATION, PERSON signed for $3.05 million as a supplemental first-rounder, PERSON nearly doubled his slot value in the sixth round -- PERSON could have been a top-three-rounds pick if he hadn't been set on becoming a Jayhawk. Three years later, his scouting reports read pretty much the same and he has the same upside in the GPE. He has a big arm that produces inconsistent results, as evidenced in early April when he gave up nine runs against PERSON and then struck out a career-high 14 against PERSON in his next start.PERSON is capable of working with a 93-96 mph fastball as a starter and has climbed as high as 98, though there are games where he'll operate at 90-93. His heater is fairly straight considering he throws from a low-three-quarters slot, an angle that makes it tough for him to stay on top of his slider, which ranges anywhere from 80-87 mph and from a below-average slurve to a plus offering with hard bite. His changeup grades better than his slider at times, though it also lacks consistency.PERSON is athletic but tends to get under his pitches, costing him control and quality. He doesn't have a track record of throwing strikes, leading several scouts to project a move the bullpen, where he could regularly feature a double-plus fastball in shorter stints. He's at his best when he pitches closer to a traditional three-quarters arm angle but has trouble doing so.",0
"Of the three third basemen selected in the first two rounds of the 2012 Draft by the LOCATION, just one has stuck at the hot corner. PERSON has moved to right field and first base, and PERSON has shifted behind the plate, with only Wisdom remaining at third base.Wisdom's tools fit the position profile well, starting with his well above-average arm strength and plus raw power. The question is whether he'll hit enough to reach his promise. He has some holes in his right-handed swing, gets pull-happy at times and struggles to recognize breaking pitches, though he made some progress in Double-A in 2015.Wisdom needs to become more consistent defensively as well. He has soft hands and good agility to go with his cannon arm, but he he makes more errors than he should.",0
"The ORGANIZATION traded PERSON to PERSON in an August 2017 waiver deal, and he only played in 23 games as a Rays farmhand before he was sent to GPE as the ORGANIZATION in the C.J. PERSON swap. He had a breakout 2018, traversing three levels to the tune of a .299/.399/.451 line, while tallying as many walks as strikeouts, 50 extra-base hits, and 41 steals. So judicious is PERSON's eye for the plate that if he were cloned 15 times and each clone forced to be an umpire, there might be a lot less talk of electronic strike zones. He identifies balls and strikes early in flight and often relaxes before balls have even entered the catcher's mitt. There's a chance that PERSON's lack of power (he has more from the right side) limits the way his eye for the zone plays in the big leagues, since pitchers will be more likely to attack him without fear of him doing damage on his own. Most of his doubles come by slashing balls down either baseline, or when he turns gappers into extra bases because of his speed. We think there's enough bat to retain most of the on-base ability PERSON has shown so far and that, combined with his multi-positional versatility, could yield super-utility value. 
Though he spent all of last year playing either second base or shortstop, PERSON also has experience in both outfield corners and at third base. The ORGANIZATION added PERSON to the 40-man this offseason and while they're well-stocked on the infield (PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, GPE), they're rather thin in the outfield, and very right-handed. As such, PERSON's first opportunity could come as an injury replacement out there, or he may fall into a Chone Figginsy utility role. Eventually though, he may end up as the regular second baseman.",1
"Before back and oblique injuries sidelined him for a month late in the season, PERSON established himself as one of the best junior college prospects in the GPE. He still may have shown enough to go in the first five rounds, and he'll transfer to GPE for 2016 if he doesn't go pro.PERSON has a loose, quick arm that's capable to delivering fastballs up to 95 mph. He usually deals at 90-93 mph with some armside run. His tight slider gives him a solid second pitch and he shows some aptitude for throwing a changeup as well.While PERSON has three pitches and a starter's build, he's probably destined to be a reliever as a pro. There's some effort in his delivery, which he tends to rush, costing him some velocity and control.",0
"PERSON had modest success in his first two years at GPE before taking off as a junior in 2017, saving 14 games to rank 10th in ORGANIZATION Division I. After the ORGANIZATION took him in the supplemental second round, he got knocked around in his pro debut while they had him focus on establishing his fastball. He overcame a rough first month this season to emerge as a reliable closer at ORGANIZATION A Asheville. PERSON relied heavily on his slider with the ORGANIZATION, but GPE has had him use his fastball more often and he now operates at 94-96 mph and tops out at 98, up about 3 mph from his college days. His heater stands out more for its plane, the product of his 6-foot-6 frame, than its life. His slider is still a weapon, arriving in the mid-80s with two-plane break.Though he has a durable build and can show a decent changeup, the ORGANIZATION have no plans to try PERSON as a starter, a role he filled briefly at GPE. He's doing a better job of throwing strikes and locating his pitches now that he's gotten acclimated to pro ball. If he keeps this up, he could be a seventh-inning reliever or possibly more in GPE.",0
"PERSON suffered a torn meniscus in February, but his physical immaturity almost certainly had him ticketed for the ORGANIZATION, so while he may be brought along slowly as minor league spring training gets underway, he should be fine for game action during extended spring training, and when rookie ball starts in June. He's a graceful but unexplosive shortstop, with a limber, projectable frame. His arm and body control are clean fits at short, though his first step leaves a bit to be desired. He may grow into some power as his body matures, which may enable him to play every day, but it's more likely that he becomes a utility type.",0
"PERSON, who is of GPE heritage, likely would have reached the majors in 2018 had he not been sidelined with shoulder fatigue in early-June. The injury effectively ended his season, as he was up for one August rehab appearance and then shut down again for the rest of the year. The exact nature of the injury is unknown and it's not clear if PERSON will be ready for the start of spring training. When healthy, PERSON has an effective four-pitch mix led by a fastball that sits in the 93-97 range and will touch 100. PERSON doesn't have precise fastball command and throws a middling ratio of strikes, but he throws hard enough to get away with mistakes in the zone, and his ability to execute his breaking balls -- the slider down and to his glove side, the curveball in the bottom of the zone or beneath it -- gives him a pretty good chance to start. There are clubs that have PERSON evaluated as a reliever either because of the lack of fastball command or due to perceptions about his deilvery and health. If not for uncertainty surrounding his injury, he'd be right behind PERSON on this list as a near-ready mid-rotation arm or dominant 70-80 inning reliever. ",0
"PERSON is a slick defensive shortstop who walked more than he struck out at ORGANIZATION and Triple-A last year. Those traits make him very interesting and perhaps someone we aren't properly enthused about. He's small and has very little raw power, but PERSON's feel for contact is so good that he ends up with sneaky, in-game doubles pop. His three-year ORGANIZATION projections have him at nearly two annual WAR, which means he arguably belongs on our Top 100 list. His realistic ceiling is that of an average regular, something that may be harder to accomplish if PERSON's presence forces him to second base, where the offensive bar is higher.",1
"GPE comes from a football family -- his grandfather PERSON, father PERSON and uncle Kris all played professionally -- but has made his name in baseball. He won the LOCATION's batting title (.408) and freshman of the year award in 2016 and stayed at ORGANIZATION State for four years despite getting drafted by the ORGANIZATION in the 30th round as a sophomore and by the ORGANIZATION in the 32nd round last year. One of the best seniors in the 2019 Draft, he broke PERSON' ORGANIZATION career hits record in April before finishing his career with 383 hits. He also led all of ORGANIZATION Division I as a senior with 108 hits, which was also a ORGANIZATION State single-season record. The scouting report on GPE has changed little during his college career. A switch-hitter, he has an extreme contact approach that results in a lot of opposite-field singles but few walks and little in the way of power. His best tool is his well above-average speed and he did a better job of translating it into stolen bases as a senior.GPE also has improved as a center fielder during his time with the ORGANIZATION, showing better reads and routes instead of just relying on his quickness to track down balls. He has a stronger arm than most at his position and touched 93 mph with his fastball when he started five games on the mound as a sophomore. One scout likened him to a faster version of PERSON.",0
"PERSON S. PERSON in GPE, GPE, has had some pro prospects grace its field, but it's been a while. There have been a pair of second-round picks from the school, including PERSON in 2005, but PERSON was actually the last player drafted from the school. GPE, perhaps the best bat in the area, should end the dry stretch.While he isn't the biggest or most projectable guy in the world, the six-foot GPE can really hit. He's one of the better pure hitters among the high school set in the country and proved that during the summer showcase circuit. The left-handed hitter can hit lefties, should continue to hit for average as perhaps a future plus hitter and should get to at least PERSON average power, with over-the-fence pop showing up well during his senior season. He's a bit limited beyond the bat, though he plays above his speed on the basepaths with good instincts and is a solid defender at first. Some think that he could play an outfield corner, with an arm that touches the upper 80s on the mound.To profile at first or right field, there will be more pressure on GPE to develop into a true run-producing type of hitter. The ORGANIZATION State PERSON commit's offensive potential could get him drafted in the top five or six rounds.",0
" After injuries limited him to just 29 games behind the plate in 2012, PERSON returned to Class A Hickory in 2013. He performed well while repeating the level and then ended the year with an impressive showing in the ORGANIZATION. He cemented his status as one of the game's top catching prospects with a solid 2014. A converted infielder, PERSON has only been catching full-time for a few years and is still a little raw defensively. He may have the strongest arm of any Minor League catcher and is remarkably athletic.  PERSON has solid raw power and began to tap into it more in 2013. His swing has a tendency to get long and he'll need to cut down on his strikeouts as he advances in the ORGANIZATION. He has decent speed and is aggressive on the basepaths. If PERSON can refine some of his more raw tools, he has tremendous upside.",1
"PERSON PERSON spent eight years in the ORGANIZATION' PERSON system, and he got called to the Majors briefly in 1988 without appearing in a game. His son PERSON has a chance to make it one step further, though his rapid ascent was put on hold when he underwent PERSON surgery in June.PERSON's unconventional mechanics include a lot of twists and turns before he comes nearly straight over the top and lands on a stiff front leg. Yet he has absolutely no problem throwing strikes, as evidenced by his 45/1 strikeout-to-walk ratio once he got to the GPE League last year.PERSON's arm slot allows him to throw a curveball with big downward break, and it's a legitimate swing-and-miss pitch. His delivery adds some deception to his low-90s sinker, and he can also mix in a slider. PERSON may not have the truly dominant pitch to become a closer, but he could be a setup man.",0
"PERSON signed in 2011 but didn't make his full-season debut until 2017, after a 2015 PERSON surgery. He's been a starter that whole time, but it sounds like he'll move to relief this year, which has always seemed like the best use of his ability. In shorter stints, he sits 95-98 and hits 99 mph with a breaking ball that flashes 60. His changeup will flash 50 at times but it's too firm and inconsistent. PERSON tinkered with a splitter that flashed 55, but he isn't confident in his feel for it yet and it'll always be a third pitch, which he may need only occasionally in relief.",0
"After signing for $75,000 as a 19th-rounder out of GPE Interamericana (P.R.) JC in 2015, PERSON batted just .223/.317/.319 in his first two pro seasons. Thus it was a surprise when he won rookie of the year honors in the GPE PERSON last offseason, leading the circuit in on-base percentage (.393) while ranking second in batting (.330) and ORGANIZATION (.806). That momentum carried over into 2017, as he has posted similar numbers in low Class A and emerged as one of the more promising hitters among GPE farmhands.PERSON is continuing to hit for average while beginning to tap into his solid raw power more often this year. To fully realize his upside as a .275 hitter with 15 or more homers per year, he'll need to improve his plate discipline further after beginning to make strides. He also could stand to add some loft to his right-handed stroke because he put the ball in play on the ground too often.PERSON is an asset at third base as well as at the plate. He moves well, has sure hands and owns one of the strongest arms in the system. He has fringy speed and is aggressive on the basepaths.",0
GPE tweener type with good feel to hit and instincts.,0
"One of the best pitching prospects to come out of the ORGANIZATION of GPE in some time, PERSON was taken by the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION Round A in the 2016 Draft, GPE. 38 overall. Many evaluations pointed to a future in the bullpen for PERSON because of his premium velocity and lack of command and after PERSON missed all of 2017 with a shoulder issue, the ORGANIZATION moved him to the bullpen with some very good early results, though he struggled to replicate them in 2019.GPEw a full-time reliever, PERSON has the chance to take off and move quickly. His fastball is still one of the best in the system, touching 99-100 mph now that he's pitching in shorter stints. His best secondary pitch is his plus changeup. PERSON throws it from the same slot and arm speed as his fastball with terrific deception and the pitch comes in at 86-88 mph and drops off the table. Healthy all season in 2018, his strike-throwing also took a nice step forward.PERSON scuffled a bit upon his promotion to the Class A Advanced California League, but the ORGANIZATION are confident he'll make the necessary adjustments to keep progressing. With his fastball-changeup combination, if his control and command continue to improve, he'll have the chance to pitch late in games.",0
"PERSON's velocity has climbed each of the last two years and now rests comfortably in the mid-90s, plus an extra tick of perceived velo due to extension. He's a classic small school late bloomer with a good frame and athletic delivery. PERSON also has an abnormally firm, sinking, upper-80s changeup, and power, low-80s curveball, both of which look like impact pitches at times. It's starter stuff, and perhaps more traditional starter's control will develop late as PERSON's stuff has. ",0
"The ORGANIZATION selected PERSON 38 picks after the ORGANIZATION selected his older brother D.J. PERSON in the first round of the 2013 Draft. After spending his first full professional season at ORGANIZATION A Fort Wayne, he was dealt to the ORGANIZATION in the trade that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION. Scouts believe PERSON is more advanced than D.J. was at the same age, and he might end up being more athletic, as well. He has a short, compact swing and a good feel for hitting. His excellent bat speed means he should develop solid power as he fills out. PERSON was a shortstop in high school, but he moved to third base as a professional. Some scouts aren't sure that he profiles at third base, and they think he might be better suited for second base or the outfield. Wherever PERSON ends up defensively, it'll be up to his bat to carry him through the ORGANIZATION.",1
" PERSON like PERSON's raw power at the plate, his bat speed and ability to always find a way to put the barrel on the ball. Put simply, PERSON can hit.PERSON think the infielder will also be able to hit for power as he matures, but for now, PERSON is a gap-to-gap hitter with plenty of potential. PERSON has also gained praise for a high baseball IQ and good makeup. He has good actions on defense and a strong throwing arm. PERSON also like his footwork on defense and his baserunning abilities.Some wonder if he will stay at shortstop or will hit enough to move to third base. He could also move to second base. It's too early to tell what his final position will be in the future, but PERSON has the potential to be an everyday player in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON is from the baseball-rich city of GPE Cristobal.",0
"PERSON won the Big West Conference batting title in 2014, when he hit .386 as a sophomore at ORGANIZATION, and then played for the GPE collegiate national team over the summer. He underwent labrum surgery that offseason after injuring his shoulder with PERSON, and it kept him from playing the field until the second half of his junior season. Shoulder injuries plagued PERSON once again in 2017, as he suffered a dislocated left shoulder during Spring Training and then logged just 35 games back in Double-A before returning to the disabled list due to ongoing soreness.When healthy, GPE officials regard PERSON as one the system's better pure hitters. He makes a lot of hard contact from the right side of the plate, producing line drives across the whole field thanks to a combination of bat speed and barrel control. He has an advanced approach and controls the strike zone well, in turn fueling his on-base skills. Though he projects for below-average over-the-fence power, PERSON, with his strength and knack for barreling the ball, has plenty of pop to the gaps and tallied 40 doubles in his full-season debut. PERSON' best position is second base, where he profiles as an above-average defender with an average arm. If he can remain healthy and stay on the field, PERSON could develop into a future utility infielder if he's unable to carve out a role as an everyday second baseman.",0
"The ORGANIZATION found three of their best prospects during the 2012-13 international signing period. In addition to right-hander PERSON and outfielder PERSON, they also landed PERSON. He had starred on junior national teams in GPE, and his $425,000 bonus was the most for any player from his nation that summer.PERSON has an advanced gameplan at the plate for a teenager, focusing on making contact and drilling line drives to all fields. Once he learns to use his plus speed, he'll be a basestealing threat. PERSON won't be a big part of his game, though he has some strength and will sting the ball into the gaps on occasion.PERSON's defensive tools aren't spectacular, but he gets the job done at shortstop and should be able to stick there. He's an instinctive defender with good hands and enough arm to make the throws required at the position.",1
"PERSON had four position players selected in the top three rounds a year ago, and could have as many as five drafted in 2017 if superstar PERSON gets taken as a first baseman. The most productive hitter in the ORGANIZATION lineup, PERSON redshirted in his first year in college and played part-time in 2016. He broke out with 11 homers in the ORGANIZATION last summer and has shown power along with improved polish at the plate this spring.PERSON' best attribute is his right-handed power. He has a quick, compact swing and strength and leverage in his 6-foot-3 frame. He has walked almost as much as he has struck out in his two college seasons. He doesn't sell out for home runs and has a chance to hit for both power and average.He has played mostly third base this spring, shifting to first base when ORGANIZATION pitches so PERSON can get prized freshman PERSON into the lineup. PERSON is a decent defender at the hot corner, possessing an average arm but somewhat limited range because he lacks quickness. He's similar to his predecessor at third on the ORGANIZATION, 2016 ORGANIZATION third-rounder PERSON, who had a bit more athleticism but a little less pop.",0
"GPE is the first GPE amateur ever signed by GPE. He's an athletic, instinctive middle infield prospect with modest physical projection and promising bat to ball skills. He has all-fields feel for contact and will likely be a hit-over-power offensive player by a good margin. He's seen action all over the infield but the bat might only profile at shortstop in an everyday capacity. He's more likely a utility type.",0
"PERSON has collected a lot of hardware at GPE since turning down the ORGANIZATION as a 40th-round pick out of an Illinois high school in 2011. He was the Big Ten Conference freshman of the year in 2012, and won ORGANIZATION honors in the Big Ten tournament and the ORGANIZATION regional last year as the ORGANIZATION made their first PERSON Series appearance.Short first basemen who hit right-handed don't usually excite scouts, but PERSON is an exception. He and GPE teammate PERSON are two of the best all-around college bats available in the 2014 Draft. PERSON combines bat speed, strength, a usually sound swing and control of the strike zone.PERSON would profile better if he could play a more challenging position, but he'll be limited to first base. He lacks the quickness and arm strength to handle third base, which he tried in the ORGANIZATION last summer, though his soft hands are an asset on the opposite corner.",1
"Even coming out of high school, PERSON was known as an elite defender behind the plate. He quickly has become the best defensive catcher in the ORGANIZATION, though his bat isn't as advanced as his glove.PERSON is the complete package behind the plate, with quiet hands, good footwork and a strong arm. Though he's struggled offensively against more advanced pitchers in the ORGANIZATION, he is not an all-glove, no-bat player. PERSON' balanced swing produces line drives to all fields, and he has good raw power. Like most catchers, he is a below-average runner.The Padres have pushed PERSON aggressively, and he has responded well. Though he still has plenty of room for improvement, he's well on his way to reaching his projection as an everyday catcher in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"PERSON joins PERSON as an electric talent in this system from the 2018 July 2nd class, now ahead of the more handsomely-bonused, PERSON. PERSON isn't huge-framed proejction outfielder but he has big bat speed and projects for plus raw power at peak anyway. He also has plus speed and has shown early-career contact skills, but he's much more talented than most of the rest of the ORGANIZATION and it's possible he has underlying issues (breaking ball recognition, expansive approach, any number of things) that we just don't know about yet because the ORGANIZATION isn't capable of shining light on them. He's a big tools teen, like PERSON in this system, just a level below.",0
" It didn't make nearly as many headlines as the ORGANIZATION Chapman and PERSON trades, but the deal that sent PERSON to the ORGANIZATION last November netted the ORGANIZATION a potential starting pitcher in GPE. Extremely young (age 17) and projectable when he signed for $100,000 in the 11th round of the 2013 Draft, he lowered his ORGANIZATION at each of his five stops in the GPE system. He went 13-6 with a 2.66 ORGANIZATION and 156 strikeouts in 165 2/3 innings between two Class A teams last year. He had earned a promotion up to Double-A in 2017 and was pitching well there when he was sent to the Twins in a Deadline deal for PERSON has improved his conditionining and his stuff, working at 91-93 mph with a fastball that plays up thanks to its rising life and his command. His best offering is often his curveball, which has depth and can be a plus pitch at times. His changeup has its moments as well and helps him keep left-handers in check.GPE's pitchability may be more impressive than his stuff. He can't overpower hitters but he mixes his pitches, pounds the strike zone and keeps the ball down, generating plenty of strikeouts and groundouts. He has a ceiling of a No. 4 starter, perhaps more if he can add more power to his pitches.",1
"Developing catching is always a tricky endeavor, with so much a player has to learn on both sides of the ball. PERSON is already a step ahead of many young backstops thanks to his advanced skills behind the plate.While still very young, PERSON has already shown excellent, receiving, blocking and throwing skills. He's mature beyond his years, calling his own game and working extremely well with pitchers. PERSON moves well behind the plate and his strong arm has already helped shut down running games. PERSON's offensive skills are behind his glovework. A switch hitter, the upstate GPE product does have a good swing from both sides of the plate, but he lacks the current strength to drive the ball with any consistency. The ORGANIZATION are more than willing to be patient with PERSON, believing that with his aptitude and plus makeup, he will develop into an all-around catcher as he gains strength and experience. At the very least, they have a capable defensive backup on their hands.",0
"PERSON turned down approximately $1 million out of a ORGANIZATION high school and had a smaller market than his talent would indicate, due to some long-term questions about his elbow and knee. At GPE, he stood out as a freshman by staying healthy and showing the above average stuff he showed in high school. Then he blew out about halfway through his sophomore year, requiring PERSON surgery. He missed all of 2017, then came back for an age-22 redshirt junior year and appeared to be all the way recovered, which lead to the ORGANIZATION taking him in the second round. Early in his career, PERSON looked to be on the same trajectory as PERSON (who also slipped in the draft due to elbow and knee concerns), which would mean ending up in the bullpen while throwing in the high-90's with a power breaking ball. PERSON surgery, he's a little more starter-looking than that, working 91-94 and hitting 95 mph, with a changeup that has emerged as his best offspeed pitch, and a high-spin curveball and slider that both are average to above. PERSON has made progress with starter traits like pitch efficiency, and reading and setting up hitters, while his stamina is building to the point of handling a starter's workload. He'll open in the upper levels and could be big league rotation help as soon as in the second half of 2019.",0
" It took parts of three summers for PERSON to graduate from the ORGANIZATION, but once he did, he showed why the ORGANIZATION signed him out of the ORGANIZATION by being very effective in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON sometimes pitches backwards, trusting his curve and changeup more than his fastball. He can throw both secondary pitches for strikes and they have the chance to be outstanding offerings. Theyâll be even better when he pitches off of his average fastball more. His overall command is a strength and heâll pitch all season at age 20, so there might be more in the tank as he matures.",1
"After scuffling in his first two professional seasons, PERSON broke out at rookie-level GPE in 2012. He set career highs in several offensive category and showed he could withstand the physical grind of playing every day. PERSON has a smooth swing and makes good contact. Listed at 5-foot-11, 165 pounds, PERSON doesn't project to hit for much power and is an average runner. He has found a home at second base, though he has played all over the diamond as a professional. He has good hands and instincts. PERSON is getting his first taste of full-season ball in 2013.",1
"The ORGANIZATION have a reputation for polishing throwers into pitchers and have another project on their hands after selecting PERSON from the Rockies in the big league phase of the Rule 5 Draft in December. Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in 2012, he was one of the hardest throwers in the ORGANIZATION. But he also spent three years in GPE ball and didn't make it to low Class A until 2017, which is one of the reasons PERSON didn't protect him.The Rockies clocked PERSON as fast as 104 mph and he generates consistent upper-90s fastballs with little effort. While he has a quick arm, impressive athleticism and little effort in his delivery, he has trouble controlling his heater. When he has to dial it down to throw strikes, it tends to get hit.PERSON also has a powerful slider in the upper 80s but has even more difficulty keeping it in the strike zone. He also has a changeup with similar velocity but it's not very effective and he's more of a two-pitch reliever. Despite his impressive radar-gun readings, PERSON actually has averaged less than a strikeout per inning as a pro and will need to add considerable polish to stick in GPE.",0
" The ORGANIZATION drafted GPE 16th overall in 2013, and he excelled in his professional debut, winning the ORGANIZATION batting title. He's continued to build on that success, making it to the ORGANIZATION Game two years in a row and reaching Double-A at age 20.GPE has an impressive all-around skill set and can impact the game on both sides of the ball. There is no question about his ability to stay at shortstop, as he is a smooth fielder with sure hands, a plus arm and good range. He is a disciplined hitter with good on-base skills and the speed to steal bases.GPE had been viewed as PERSON' heir apparent from the time he was drafted. With PERSON now gone, there is no major roadblock for GPE, who may not need all that much more time until he's ready.",1
"After a GPE baseball mission group visited his nation when he was 15, PERSON returned to the GPE with them so he could improve his baseball skills while attending high school. Signed for $75,000 as a 26th-round pick in 2013, he enjoyed a breakout campaign in '16, highlighted by an impressive second-half in Double-A, before being acquired by PERSON along with PERSON and PERSON for PERSON early in December. He's done nothing but impress in his first season with PERSON, earning All-Star honors in the LOCATION before advancing to Triple-A and representing the World Team in the ORGANIZATION All-Star PERSON in July.PERSON has tremendous hand-eye coordination and a quick right-handed bat, allowing him to barrel balls with ease. He showed more patience in 2016, drawing more walks and getting himself out on weak contact less frequently. He also showed an uptick in power and hit the ball in the air more consistently. PERSON is a true shortstop, one with quick hands and feet as well as the arm strength to make plays from either side of the bag, who can play anywhere on the infield, and he increased his defensive versatility during the ORGANIZATION by playing some center field.PERSON is trying to become the first native GPE and second GPE-born player (after PERSON) to reach the big leagues. Though he's trapped behind slick-fielding shortstop PERSON on the ORGANIZATION' depth chart, PERSON's ability to play multiple up-the-middle positions, all while contributing at the plate, gives him a high floor as a big leaguer.",0
" When drafting high school pitchers, it's usually about projecting what they can be, rather than just looking at what they are at ORGANIZATION time. That's exactly what the ORGANIZATION did with the 6-foot-7 PERSON, and the early indications were that the ORGANIZATION' scouts' projections were right on the money. The A's saw his improvement and acquired him for reliever PERSON in advance of the ORGANIZATION Deadline.When PERSON first entered pro ball, he was throwing his fastball in the upper 80s, topping out at 90-91 mph. He's already taken a step forward, velocity-wise, throwing 90-94 mph last summer as a teenager in the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League and using his large frame to create a good downhill angle. He complements the improving fastball with a big curve, and he has shown an excellent feel to spinning the ball. While his changeup is behind, he's shown some feel for the offspeed pitch as well. His overall pitchability and consistency in finding the strike zone are better than you'd think for a young pitcher of his size. PERSON development of his secondary pitches will be key, but PERSON took another step in the right direction in full-season ball in 2015.",0
"Seen as a lock to stick at shortstop while he was an amateur, PERSON has been error-prone there for several years and saw more time at second in 2018. He projects there for most scouts. The movement in his batted ball profile has plateaued (PERSON began his career as an all-fields, groundball hitter but began pulling and lifting the ball more starting in 2016), but might still produce more power than is usual at second base right now, even if it's generally middling. (PERSON raps on the side under the alter ego 'G PERSON', which is also the name of an ASU-educated 'Artist Entrepreneur,' so one of the two of them may have a copyright issue on their hands.) PERSON's star seems to have fallen quite a bit, and instead of projecting as a shortstop with some pop, he'll now need to hit enough to play second everyday or risk being squeezed out of a roster spot. He began 2019 on the ORGANIZATION with a digestive issue.",0
"Long one of the more intriguing position prospects in GPE's system, PERSON missed all of 2013 following PERSON surgery but returned to make his big league debut the following year. However, his chances of securing a spot in the ORGANIZATION' outfield were diminished with the club's offseason trades for PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, and he spent the entire 2015 season back in Triple-A. In January, PERSON was acquired by the Brewers after being designated for assignment by GPE.PERSON is a multitalented player with at least average tools across the board and the versatility to play all three outfield positions. His bat speed gives him power to all fields, though it's mitigated by a free-swinging approach and a propensity to chase breaking balls that also depress his batting average.PERSON is a solid runner who knows how to steal bases and with the upside of a 20-20 player. Though he fits best in right field with his strong arm, PERSON presumably will have to compete with right-handed-hitting corner outfielders PERSON, PERSON and PERSON for playing time in GPE next season.",1
"After a promising 2014 full-season debut in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON held his own in the ORGANIZATION State League in '15 despite being one of its younger players. After the season, the ORGANIZATION dealt him to the ORGANIZATION in exchange for PERSON. The young ORGANIZATION infielder has largely played second base and it is his best position, with the chance for him to be an above-average defender there. But he's capable of playing shortstop as well, though his range -- thanks to his fringy speed -- is probably better suited for the right side of the diamond. PERSON isn't all glove, though, with a very good feel for making consistent contact. He doesn't walk very much, but he also doesn't strike out a ton. He's an advanced offensive player for his age, one who has a line-drive approach to all fields and has the chance to add a little pop as he matures.Along with top prospect PERSON, the ORGANIZATION could produce an interesting double-play combination in the coming years.",0
"PERSON could have been a third-round pick out of a GPE high school in 2011 had he been willing to turn pro, but he was set on becoming a Longhorn. The most highly regarded arm in a deep GPE recruiting class, he had PERSON surgery after his freshman season and missed all of 2013, when he also had a rib removed to alleviate thoracic outlet syndrome. He has come back strong as a closer as a redshirt sophomore this spring and should return to starting again in 2015.PERSON has regained the velocity on his fastball, which sits at 92-94 mph and peaks at 96, and he uses his 6-foot-5 frame to throw his heater on a steep downhill plane. He still can run his slider up into the 80s, though it can get slurvy and he battles his command with it. Pitchers who have their elbows reconstructed often need time to get back their consistency and command of their secondary pitches, so his slider should get better.Because he's working in relief, PERSON hasn't found much need for a changeup, which will require plenty of work when he joins the rotation. A potential No. 2 or 3 starter if everything comes together, he's also highly intelligent and graduated from GPE in three years with a double major in GPE and history.",1
"PERSON rave about PERSON and it's no surprise that the athletic switch-hitting shortstop is one of the top infielders in this year's class. At the plate, PERSON uses an upright stance with a short stride and a loose line-drive stroke to make hard consistent contact to all fields. His quick hands and bat speed generate some power now, and the belief is that he will even more power in the future. PERSON love the way he has a knack for barreling up balls and how balls fly off of his bat. He's been praised for his overall approach and knowledge of the strike zone.On defense, PERSON shows good instincts with a live and accurate arm. His defensive actions are sound and his footwork continues to improve. He's a confident player with a strong mental approach. He's an above-average runner.PERSON trains with PERSON in GPE Mayor, GPE. The ORGANIZATION are the favorites to sign the teenage shortstop.",1
"Selected by the ORGANIZATION in the fourth round of the 2011 Draft out of PERSON (Fla.) CC, PERSON spent the first three seasons of his career in GPE ball before a breakout 2014 full-season debut at ORGANIZATION A Quad Cities. After the ORGANIZATION acquired him last May in exchange for two international bonus slots, PERSON enjoyed success at both ORGANIZATION A Advanced PERSON and Double-A Bowie. Following the season, PERSON added him to its 40-man roster. He returned to the LOCATION in 2016 and won five of his seven starts before landing on the disabled list in late May with soreness in the muscle area of his left shoulder. The left-hander attempted to throw a bullpen in early July, only to have his session shut down due to ongoing discomfort.PERSON works in the 91-94 range with his fastball and can reach back for a few extra ticks, throwing the pitch down in the zone with late life and running action. The slider has two variations: one with short, tight action in the mid- to upper-80s; the other in the 82-85 mph range with more traditional sweeping action. PERSON's changeup lags behind the two offerings, which has caused problems against right-handed hitters throughout his career.That the ORGANIZATION adjusted PERSON's mechanics following the trade contributed to his success as starter in 2015, as it allowed the left-hander to make better use of his athleticism and repeat his delivery with more consistency. PERSON will need to continue to make strides with both his changeup and control to break through as a starter, but his strong track record against lefties could help him carve out a bullpen role in the coming year.",0
"The ORGANIZATION rolled the dice last offseason by not protecting PERSON from the Rule 5 Draft. The gamble paid off, as the big right-hander was deemed too far away to be taken, so he could go back to work with PERSON. There's a lot to work with. The 6-foot-8 PERSON has a ton of arm strength, with electric stuff. His fastball can touch triple digits, sitting in the 92-96 mph range. He uses his height very well and can get on hitters in a hurry as a result. PERSON has a breaking ball and changeup, both of which have the chance to be solid options, but they have been inconsistent for much of his career. So has his command, a big reason why his progress has been slow. The ORGANIZATION moved PERSON to the bullpen in 2015, where his power arm can play up, but a strained lat forced him out of action for an extended period of the Double-A PERSON season.",0
"The ORGANIZATION spent two of their first three picks in the 2014 Draft on offensive-minded catcher/outfielders from college: PERSON (first round) and PERSON (third). While PERSON accepted the challenge of trying to make it behind the plate, PERSON wasn't as committed and became a full-time corner outfielder a year later. The most disciplined hitter in the system, he started driving the ball more consistently while advancing to Triple-A in 2016.PERSON is an on-base machine because he's a gifted hitter who controls the strike zone and doesn't try to do too much at the plate. He mostly focuses on stroking line drives from gap to gap but did start attacking more pitches last year. He has average bat speed and his right-handed stroke lacks loft, but he could provide 12-15 homers per year because he barrels so many balls.While PERSON is a decent athlete, most of his value will come from his offense. His speed, arm and defensive ability all grade out as average, and his outfield instincts still need more refinement. He split 2016 between left and right field, and he's capable of filling in in center.",1
"PERSON was a raw, toolsy catcher when he was a high schooler in GPE. The level of competition he faced and opposing pitchers' predilection to pitching around him made it difficult for teams to scout PERSON and he wound up in college. He blossomed as an outfielder PERSON, breaking out in the ORGANIZATION in the summer of 2012. PERSON remains relatively raw and toolsy and some scouts wonder if he will be able to adjust to more advanced pitching, though he performed extremely well in the ORGANIZATION as a junior. PERSON creates good bat speed and has plenty of raw power, which he will tap into the more he can improve his approach. PERSON has average speed and is faster once he's under way. He has a strong arm and profiles as a potential five-tool right fielder.",1
"Signed in July 2012 out of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON spent his first three pro seasons in GPE ball before finally advancing to a full-season level for the first time in 2016. He scuffled a bit the following year, receiving a mid-season demotion from the Class A Advanced California League back to Class A PERSON, but rebounded with a breakout 2018 campaign in which he established career highs in most offensive categories. PERSON continued to perform well in the ORGANIZATION, and the A's added him to the 40-man roster after the season.PERSON makes a lot of contact from the left side of the plate, where he employs an open setup with a flat swing that enables him to spray the ball across the whole field. While it does limit his power potential, PERSON has a knack for finding the gaps and uses his plus speed to take extra bases when possible. That speed also makes PERSON a capable center fielder, and he has the requisite arm strength needed to play right field.With his left-handed bat, speed and defensive versatility, PERSON has the makings of becoming a future bench outfielder at the highest level. If he can make further strides as a hitter, and possibly add some power to his game, he could take on a greater role.",0
"PERSON PERSON surgery wiped out PERSON' first two college seasons at GPE, and he pitched sparingly on a loaded 2016 Gators staff that included five future first-rounder. But the ORGANIZATION saw enough to take him in the fourth round that June, and he has proven healthy and durable since. He led the Minors with 15 wins in 2018 and made a successful jump to Double-A this year before going to the Indians in a three-team trade in July that sent PERSON to Cincinnati.PERSON won't be a pitcher who wows people with his stuff because all three of his pitches grade as average. But he has a 91-92 mph fastball that gets on hitters quickly because he commands it well and gets excellent extension in his delivery. PERSON liked his slider more than his changeup in 2018, but the latter pitch has been more effective this year.Though PERSON struggled with his control early in the 2019 season, he settled down and resumed throwing strikes. His ceiling is somewhat limited, but he knows what he's doing on the mound and misses enough bats to eventually be a fifth starter or swingman in the big leagues.",0
"Even among a historically talented group of ORGANIZATION shortstops (PERSON, PERSON, GPE Turang), PERSON was clearly the most gifted defender of the group and the best defensive high school infielder a lot of scouts have ever seen. He has 80 hands, above-average range, a plus arm, and an intoxicating flare and confidence not typical of humans of this stature. PERSON's size, or lack there of, is why he fell to the draft's third round, as there was concern he would not have the requisite physicality to hit big league pitching. After a few years of pro ball, scouts think his wrists and forearms are strong enough to put viable contact in play, but probably not with enough force to truly profile as an everyday shortstop. 
Sources who have seen PERSON and other punchless leatherwizards think the likes of PERSON and PERSON had more thump than PERSON does at the same age. That's not to say that they don't think PERSON is a big leaguer, as everyone thinks he's going to have a very long big league career as an elite defensive shortstop and infield utility man a la PERSON or PERSON. That type of player is going away, but we think PERSON is exceptional.",0
"A 2013 international signee out of the ORGANIZATION, PERSON opened eyes the next year during his impressive professional debut in the ORGANIZATION. That success carried over into his first stateside action in 2015, when he slashed .344/.380/.469 in 45 games between the ORGANIZATION and GPE York-Penn Leagues. PERSON advanced to full-season ball for the first time in 2016, only to miss a portion of the first half with an ankle injury and appear in just 73 games.PERSON's quick hands from the left side of the plate fuel his game as a slap hitter who predominantly hits the ball on the ground and sprays it from line to line. He's also an adept bunter and gets out of the batter's box quickly, utilizing his above-average speed. PERSON will never offer much in the way of power, but he makes enough hard contact to accrue his share of doubles and triples.A raw defender when he signed, PERSON was one of GPE's more improved outfielders in 2016 after making strides with his routes and angles to the ball. He's capable of playing center field but profiles better in left, where his speed and average arm strength are cleaner fits.",0
"After yo-yoing back and forth between the bullpen and rotation since college, PERSON was finally 'penned in 2018 and had a two-inning sip of coffee with the GPE last June before he fractured his right fibula during a play at the plate. He would need season-ending surgery. PERSON's command has long foreshadowed an eventual permanent move to the bullpen, but he has the stuff to accrue big league outs. He can alter the shape of his mid-90s fastball to sink or cut, has a fine mid-80s curveball, and a power changeup that averages 90mph. He didn't throw his hard cutter/slider during his short appearances with the ORGANIZATION last year, but we're unsure if the pitch has actually be scrapped. It's an unusually deep repertoire for a reliever, probably one better suited for inducing ground balls than strikeouts, but is possibly enough for PERSON to go for four or more outs at a time.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION ORGANIZATION Player: PERSON is a two-sport star for PERSON, excelling on the gridiron as a wide receiver along with on the diamond as a middle infielder. He participated in ORGANIZATION's Breakthrough Series event this past year.A switch-hitter, ORGANIZATION has an athletic build and a medium frame which allows him to make consistent contact. He has a medium-length swing from both sides of the plate and boasts fair bat speed.",0
"One of the youngest players in the 2013 Draft, PERSON didn't turn 18 until three months after he signed for $159,700 as an eighth-round pick. He spent most of his first two pro seasons in GPE ball before making a strong impression during his full-season debut in 2015.PERSON has one of the purest bats in the ORGANIZATION system. He employs a compact left-handed swing that sprays line drives to all fields and has a knack for working counts. His approach doesn't result in a lot of power, though he can sting the ball into the gaps on occasion.PERSON has solid speed but still is learning how to apply it on the bases and in the outfield. A center fielder in 2013 and 2014, he has played mostly left field this season. His below-average arm precludes him from seeing action in right field.",1
"A 2017 PERSON breakout coincided with good health and a pair of prescription lenses. He walked more than he struck out across three minor league levels, and rose to Triple-A and into our overall top 100. He had a similarly strong 2018, which included a Futures Game invite, a .390 OBP at Triple-A, and then a strong 30-game big league stint in GPE and September, all reinforcing that PERSON's 2017 breakout was legitimate. A solid if unspectacular defender, PERSON's pop times were depressed during his big league cameo, hovering between 2.05 and 2.10, both below average for a catcher. But he's an average receiver and ball-blocker, and is a perfectly acceptable defensive catcher without a disqualifying shortcoming. 
Where PERSON shines is in the batter's box. His hands work in a tight loop, giving PERSON the capacity to catch velocity and still lift the baseball, and he's strong enough to muscle out balls to his pull-side, though to this point his approach has yielded more doubles than homers. He is a pull-only plodder and he'll likely always be a low ORGANIZATION guy, and it's possible major league pitchers will find ways to attack him in ways that limit his power output, but he's going to make a lot of contact and reach base, which, at catcher, could make him an All-Star.",1
"PERSON found a better slider in 2019 and went from a lefty with average stuff to one with an out pitch. His fastball command is crude, and he especially struggles to work fastballs to his glove side right now. When he can get it in there, the angle is tough on righties and it helps set up backfoot sliders, which PERSON locates pretty consistently. He has fastball-heavy starter stuff and repertoire depth, but below-average command will probably limit him to inefficient, five-ish inning outings, or perhaps move him to the bullpen. If his velo ticks up out of the 'pen then it could be a dominant pitch, as it already plays up due to extension and angle. ",0
"The ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON twice, in the 17th round out of an ORGANIZATION high school in 2008 and in the 25th round as a redshirt junior from GPE Tech four years later. In between, he spent a season each at LOCATION and GPE (Ariz.) CC and had PERSON surgery. Signed for $5,000, he made his big league debut in September 2014 and was sold to the Athletics a year later.PERSON somehow misses bats despite lacking a true plus pitch. He operates at 89-94 mph with a fastball that has some armside run, throws a downer curveball to left-handers and back-foots his slider against righties. He also mixes in a changeup that can be an average offering at ORGANIZATION's control and command never have been his strong suits. He did a better job of locating his pitches where he wanted in 2014, though his walk rate jumped back up in 2015. He's unusual as a situation lefty who's not easy prey for right-handed hitters.",0
"PERSON had a rough first season in pro ball as a 20-year-old in the ORGANIZATION. His bat was raw coming out of high school, especially for a hitter who was old for his class, but he was a second round pick because he already had big power and was likely to grow into more. He remains an archtypical right field prospect. There's power, a huge frame, and arm strength. He'd be a sophomore-eligible college player in 2019 had he gone to PERSON and the ORGANIZATION typically send newly drafted collegians to the ORGANIZATION York-Penn League. That means PERSON will likely begin 2019 in extended spring training and, since he'll essentially be repeating that level until June, he needs to start hitting while he's there.",0
"While shortstop PERSON was creating buzz running up ORGANIZATION boards as a superior college shortstop, PERSON was more than making a name for himself with as consistent a performance on the mound as any college starter in the country.PERSON has moved around during his college career, starting at ORGANIZATION, moving to PERSON as a sophomore, then moving to the ORGANIZATION and becoming their Friday starter as a junior. He might now have wow stuff, but what he has has been really good in 2015, all coming from an easy, simple delivery. He pitches off his fastball, which is a tick above-average sitting in the 92-94 mph range, and it plays up because of his feel for the strike zone. His slider has been a bit inconsistent, but he's shown it can be a solid breaking ball in the past. His changeup needs some refinement and looks kind of like a hybrid splitter-type pitch.PERSON will need to improve his third pitch to continue to have success at the pro level, but he's raised his stock this spring and has the makings of a solid, innings-eating starter.",0
"The biggest over-slot signing by the ORGANIZATION in the 2013 Draft, PERSON got $278,000 in the 18th round to pass up his commitment to PERSON. He has made steady progress, getting stronger and polishing his all-around tools to blossom into a potential five-tool player. A strong start in Triple-A this season earned him his first big league callup in late June, but he ruptured the patellar tendon in his right knee when he ran into an outfield wall in his first game with the ORGANIZATION and was lost for the year. Nearly a month after suffering the injury, PERSON was dealt to the A's with PERSON and PERSON at the ORGANIZATION for right-hander PERSON. PERSON makes repeated hard contact with a short, quick left-handed stroke. His bat speed, strength and plus speed give him 20-20 upside, though he's still learning to be an efficient basestealer. To reach his offensive ceiling, he'll need to get more selective at the plate because he walks infrequently and puts too many early-count pitches in play rather than waiting for one to drive.PERSON has made tremendous defensive improvement since turning pro. He has worked diligently with outfield instructor PERSON to refine his reads and routes, going from spending the majority of his time on the corners in his first two season to being a quality center fielder. He also has bolstered his arm strength to at least average.",1
"PERSON was one of the top two-way players available in the 2014 Draft, with the majority of teams believing he had a higher upside on the mound. PERSON bucked that consensus, however, by taking him as an outfielder and paying him $914,600 as a second-round pick.The ORGANIZATION winner at the Under PERSON All-America Game at FACILITY last August, PERSON combines bat speed, strength and feel for hitting, making it possible that he could develop into a .285 hitter with 20 homers per season. He broke into pro ball as a center fielder, but he eventually should move to right, where his plus arm will fit well. PERSON is an average runner.On the mound, PERSON's three-quarters delivery gives him good angle and movement on his fastball, which averages 89-91 mph and peaks at 94. He also features a promising curveball and a changeup with some life.",1
"GPE may have posted the second-worst ORGANIZATION (4.69) of his career in 2016, but his year didn't lack positives. He worked a career-high 134 1/3 innings, ranked third in the Triple-A PERSON in strikeouts (122) despite not arriving there until mid-May and would have placed second in whiff rate (10.2 per nine innings) if he hadn't fallen just short of enough innings to qualify. He continued to build on that progress in 2017 -- until he received a season-ending suspension on July 1 after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs.GPE's fastball sits at 91-94 mph and peaks at 96, but it's much nastier than its velocity alone would indicate. He's 6-foot-7 and his long levers give him great extension and create a difficult plane and angle when he keeps his delivery in sync. His secondary pitches lack reliability, though his mid-80s slider is solid at times and his fringy changeup is improving.San Francisco still envisions GPE as a starter, and he'll need to refine his changeup, control and command to succeed in that role in the big leagues. He could make for a very dynamic reliever, giving hitters an unusual look while theoretically adding more velocity in shorter stints.",0
"PERSON entered 2012 as a first-round candidate before a lackluster high school senior season and his commitment to PERSON dropped him to the ORGANIZATION in the 39th round. He has had a hard time staying healthy since, redshirting in 2013 after thoracic outlet and PERSON surgeries and pitching once in 2014 because of a stress fracture in his back. He pitched well in the ORGANIZATION rotation last year, though signability and health questions cause him to fall to the Cardinals in the 28th round, then missed the first three months of the 2016 season with a lat strain.In three truncated starts at the end of the regular season, PERSON showed why scouts have been tracking him for years. He sat in the low 90s and touched 96 mph with his fastball, which features run and heavy sink. His low-80s slider continued to show flashes of becoming a plus pitch, and he seemed to trust his developing changeup more than ever.Though he has three pitches and consistently delivers strikes, PERSON's lack of durability makes it hard to project him as a starter in pro ball. With his size (6-foot-7) and fastball/slider combination, he could become a high-leverage reliever if he can stay on the mound. Because he's already 22 and has such an extensive medical history, he's a wild card for the GPE.",0
"PERSON ORGANIZATION has had its fair share of draftees, PERSON being by far the most successful, but only a half-dozen have been taken in the top three rounds of the regular Draft in June. PERSON's size and stuff give him the chance to give the program a lucky No. 7 taken in the early rounds this year.A product of the ORGANIZATION high school ranks, PERSON's 6-foot-4 frame and plus fastball have gotten plenty of attention this spring. He's been touching 95 mph consistently throughout his starts. He throws two breaking balls, a fringy curveball and a slider that flashes above-average. He mixes in a viable changeup as well. PERSON's arm action can get a bit long, making it tougher for him to repeat his delivery. That, in turn, leads to command issues.PERSON's arm strength, durable frame and potential four-pitch mix could give him the chance to at least get sent out as a starter. But a team taking him in the top three rounds will also know that shortening him up and putting him in the bullpen could allow his fastball-slider combination to play up and get him to the big leagues more quickly.",0
"PERSON went through his redshirt sophomore season at Nevada-Reno without too much fanfare, though he did hit over .400. It was unbeknownst to anyone, it seems, that he was actually PERSON eligible. That fact was discovered as he was playing well for the GPE National Collegiate Team, with several teams expressing interest. The ORGANIZATION won out, signing him for $735,000 as a non-drafted free agent.PERSON is a fast-twitch athlete who went out in his pro debut and did what he had done all spring and early summer: hit. He has a solid approach at the plate, one that is geared to line drives and hitting the gaps. He does have some raw power, but he has a firm understanding of what his game is. That's getting on base and causing damage with his plus speed. That speed works in the outfield as well, where he covers a lot of ground and plays an above-average center field.PERSON might profile best as a fourth outfielder type, one who can play good defense at all three spots and impact the game with his speed. If he hits enough, though, he could end up being a table-setting regular in center field.",0
"The ORGANIZATION selected PERSON in the 14th round in 2016 out ORGANIZATION, where he had posted a career .355 average over three seasons. He continued to show an advanced bat during his pro debut, but opened his first full season behind schedule due to a wrist injury. When he finally took the field in mid-May, PERSON torched PERSON pitching at a .361/.431/.530 clip to earn a late promotion to Class A Advanced Lynchburg. PERSON is a toolsy college product with remaining upside. Hitting from an open stance, he creates leverage to the ball and keeps his barrel in the zone for an extended period of time. It in turn allows him to effectively cover both sides of the plate and use the entire field, something he has always done well. PERSON does have some pop in his bat, though it's mostly to the gaps right now. He's an above-average runner who gets out of the box well and finished fourth in the ORGANIZATION' system with 20 steals in 2017 despite limited action. PERSON's speed also plays well in right field, where he spent his entire full-season debut, and his above-average arm strength is a natural fit at the position. While his hit-over-power profile at a corner position might not hold up as well at higher levels, PERSON's broad set of skills and solid tools give him a solid chance to consistently outperform projections.",0
"Ever since PERSON signed out of the ORGANIZATION for just $90,000 in 2009, he's shown glimpses of very exciting tools. He's been as enigmatic as he's been productive, however, making it a bit tough to evaluate his future.The 2015 season was a microcosm of PERSON's development. The young infielder was hitting for average and decent pop, stealing bases and playing good second base. When he didn't get called up following injuries to PERSON and PERSON, PERSON wasn't happy, and it showed in his performance. PERSON continues to be the key to his inconsistencies. PERSON has the tools to be a top-of-the-order hitter with more extra-base power than you'd expect. He always had the range and hands to play shortstop, his original position, but the mental grind proved to be too much. PERSON is capable of playing good defense on the right side of the infield.PERSON has played second, the outfield and a little bit of third base in Triple-A during the 2016 season while continuing to take ground balls at short, and he did make his big league debut briefly in May. To stick, he might have to break in as a super-utility type. But he'll have to earn his way there and prove he can handle the bright lights of the big leagues.",1
" GPE finished runner-up at the 2014 College World Series, thanks in part to a lineup that featured four players drafted in the first seven rounds. The 2015 version of the ORGANIZATION won it all in 2015. ORGANIZATION, the ORGANIZATION' fifth-round pick, was supposed to be the team's top returning hitter, but back surgery in late January altered those plans. When healthy, ORGANIZATION is a pure hitter who controls the strike zone well and excels at getting on base. At 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds, he has the strength and leverage to produce above-average left-handed power. To do so, he'll need to get more aggressive, incorporate his lower half better in his swing and turn on more pitches, something he struggled doing when he first returned. ORGANIZATION moves better than most players his size, using his solid speed well on the bases and in the outfield. The only below-average tool in his arsenal is his arm, which relegates him to left field, a spot he played during his pro debut.",0
"Even though PERSON' frame hasn't filled out very much since he teenage days, his velocity has climbed. PERSON and spindly, the low-slot lefty now sports a fastball that sits in the low-to-mid 90s. PERSON uses his curveball to attack both left and right-handed hitters, and his lack of changeup development to this point is the chief reason why he may project to the bullpen, where he may throw even harder and turn into something resembling PERSON. We like lanky, athletic pitchers with feel for spin. Though there are clear things to work on, PERSON is one of those. He should spend 2019 at Hi-A.",0
" The ORGANIZATION were able to sign PERSON out of their own backyard with an over-slot deal that kept him from attending PERSON. Then they sent the big right-hander to full-season ball to make his debut in 2011 and pushed him up a level to the ORGANIZATION in year two. He finished fourth in the organization in strikeouts and batting average against while pitching nearly the entire season at age 20. PERSON has a terrific pitcherâs frame and flashes the stuff to go with it. His fastball can be above-average, up to 93-94 mph. Heâll show glimpses of an average curve and his changeup has the chance to be average as well. His secondary stuff can be inconsistent, particularly command-wise. If he can continue to find a level of consistency with his delivery, his stuff has the chance to take a leap forward. Heâs continuing to move up the ladder, still fairly ahead of the curve age-wise.",0
"After going undrafted out of high school, PERSON spent the 2016 season at ORGANIZATION (Fla.) JC, where he showed dynamic athleticism and tools but produced uneven results. The ORGANIZATION still made him their 11th round pick that June, and he signed for $400,000.Much like they did with 2015 second-rounder PERSON, the ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON with the intention of making him a switch-hitter. He's impressed the club with his aptitude in learning to hit from the left side, but, overall, he's a bit of a project at the plate. PERSON's elite speed is a weapon, both in center field and on the basepaths, but he needs to improve his basestealing technique. PERSON also has a well above-average arm, especially for center field. Team officials rave about PERSON's athleticism, speed and promising hitting ability, and the belief is that he'll eventually develop the necessary baseball skills.",0
"GPE, in GPE, is known more for producing wine than baseball players. PERSON, a strong, athletic right-hander from PERSON, could change all of that.PERSON has been on radar screens for a while, but really saw his stock soar as the spring progressed. While other intriguing prep arms in GPE have been inconsistent, PERSON has been impressive on a regular basis. The 6-foot-3 righty has some serious power stuff, headlined by a fastball that has consistently been up to 94-96 mph this spring. He throws two breaking balls, with the curve a bit ahead of the slider. Throwing from a higher slot, he gets under the slider at times, but when he stays on top of it, it can be a nasty out pitch. His changeup is a bit behind, but is a viable option. In addition to his stuff, scouts love the ORGANIZATION commit's competitiveness and the football mentality -- he was also his high school's quarterback -- he brings to the mound. That should help him maximize his formidable raw stuff and fly off the board as early as the first round.",0
"PERSON's velocity was up during the ORGANIZATION. Low-slot lefties who touch 96 and have an average breaking ball typically end up in someone's bullpen, and we thought PERSON had a shot to be picked in the Rule 5. He was hurt a few times during the spring and summer and his fastball has a hittable angle, so we're rounding down a bit on what otherwise looks like a fine middle relief piece if you just look at the stuff.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON MLB Player: PERSON has emerged as one of GPE's top recruits due to his success in 2015-16. He even made an All-Tournament Team with the ORGANIZATION at the 2016 ORGANIZATION World Championship. PERSON can hide his arm well with a quick delivery and thus has no problem holding runners on at first base. His fastball still sits just below average in terms of velocity, but it can sneak up on hitters, and he pairs the heater with a slow curveball.",0
"PERSON's broad, square, muscular shoulders look like they belong to a D1 high school football prospect. He has one of the better frames in the class and plenty of room to add power to a body that already produces a lot of it. PERSON has explosive hands and a natural uppercut swing. He hits many more balls out during BP than is typical for a hitter this age and has taken his peers deep in games, too. PERSON's feet and actions are workable on the infield but he struggles with throwing velocity and accuracy when he's forced to throw from a lower arm slot, as shortstops often are. If he can't correct it he'll need to move to the outfield. PERSON's power separates him from most of the rest of the class and he's a potential star if he can stay at short.",0
"In the not-too-distant past, a player like PERSON would have been overlooked by many teams because of his size. The combination of more organizations embracing analytics and the success of players like PERSON, not to mention the superb performance of the 5-foot-7 infielder, had PERSON poised to perhaps be the top college position player taken in the 2018 Draft. A broken wrist at the start of the season slowed him down, but he returned in April swinging a hot bat.While PERSON might have been more of a gut feel kind of player for scouts, he now has track record on top of being a scout favorite. Analytics departments love him because of his approach at the plate that led to more walks than strikeouts in 2017, and while he doesn't have a ton of over-the-fence power, he makes consistent hard contact and is a legitimate extra-base threat. His speed and instincts should allow him to continue to be a base stealer.While PERSON has played mostly second base in deference to PERSON at FACILITY, some feel he could handle shortstop if need be. If not, he has the chance to be a ORGANIZATION caliber second baseman in the future. Even with the injury, he should land squarely in the top 10 in June.",0
"Before the ORGANIZATION took PERSON in the 29th round of the 2011 Draft, no one had ever been selected from PERSON in GPE. It's been a long and winding path for the hard-throwing right-hander, but things appeared to start clicking a bit in 2015 as he reached Double-A for the first time. After a strong ORGANIZATION showing, he was added to the ORGANIZATION' 40-man roster.PERSON has always had premium velocity and a decent slider, but has been all over the place. He'll sit in the mid-90s and touch 97-98 mph regularly, throwing it with a ton of sink to get a lot of ground-ball outs. His slider is an out pitch at times and he'll mix in a splitter. In the past, he'd look like a world-beater one night and like he'd never pitched before the next. In 2015, he started to figure it out and find some level of consistency, though command is still an issue.Continued strike-throwing could raise PERSON's profile a bit, though he's likely never going to close games. A career as a seventh-inning guy might be his ceiling.",0
"GPE is a well-rounded prospect who has a chance to play everyday so long as he stays at shortstop as his bat, though competent, looks as though it will offer little impact. ",1
"PERSON's velocity was way down last year, often resting 91-93 and sometimes ranging to 89-93, after he had gone long stretches of high school starts where he'd sit 93-95. His violent head whack and arm action caused considerable consternation among amateur scouts who worried about his long term arm health, but the org attributes PERSON's 2018 velo decline to the rigors of pro ball, something it believes PERSON will be better prepared to deal with in 2019. The most electric version of PERSON has a high-leverage fastball/curveball combination, a two-pitch duo that could close games. If PERSON's changeup and command improve, he has mid-rotation upside. He made strike-throwing strides in 2018, but the changeup is still below-average. He should be ticketed for full-season ball and see a substantial innings increase, but the key variable to watch when camp breaks is his velocity.",0
"GPE was a two-way prospect in high school before a shoulder injury ended his future on the mound. It didn't hinder his ability in in the outfield, however, and his above-average speed and athleticism make him a prototypical center fielder. He covers ground well and has shown improving outfield instincts. At the plate, GPE has quick hands and a smooth left-handed swing. In order to reach his potential, he will have to improve his approach. He has surprising pop in his wiry frame but has a tendency to try to hit home runs too often. PERSON hasn't had an easy transition to the ORGANIZATION, his raw tools still give him the chance to develop into a solid everyday player.",0
"PERSON spent three years in the UNC-Greensboro rotation, but they were uneven seasons, at best. The ORGANIZATION, though, liked his size and his potential enough to take him in the third round of the 2014 Draft. He rewarded their faith with a strong full-season debut the following year and continued to climb the ladder in 2016, culminating with an impressive second-half showing in Double-A. But PERSON's time with the ORGANIZATION came to an end late in November, when PERSON dealt him and PERSON to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON uses his 6-foot-8 frame well to throw downhill, and while his four-seam fastball doesn't feature a ton of sink or life, that plane can help him get ground-ball outs. It will sit in the 92-93 mph range and can touch 95-96 on occasion. His changeup is his best secondary pitch and he also throws a true curveball, a breaking pitch that might improve if he can tighten it and add a little velocity to it.More athletic than you'd think given his gangly frame, PERSON fields his position well and repeats his delivery better than you might expect, translating in strong control and command and giving him the chance to be at least a back-end rotation guy in the future.",1
"PERSON was a huge standout player at the heavily-scouted ORGANIZATION showcase in the GPE in February. He didn't swing and miss in about a dozen swings (a rarity for the event) and made consistent loud contact while also displaying his above average speed and projectable power. PERSON is the ORGANIZATION got on him hard especially after this event and I was also at this event, so I buy the upside here, even if the swing is a little unique. PERSON has a chance to stick in center field, but at this age and body type, it's hard to predict the differnce between 50 and 55 and 60 speed at maturity, so you're buying more the well-rounded skillset than a particular position at this point.",1
"After hitting .240 in his first three seasons at LOCATION, PERSON batted .346 with 20 steals as a senior, won the PERSON as college baseball's best catcher and was named Pac-12 Conference defensive player of the year. He has continued to impress after signing for $100,000 as an eighth-rounder in 2015, batting .304/.391/.469 and reaching Double-A during his first full pro season.His 5-foot-10, 175-pound frame leads to a lot of questions about whether he'll be durable enough to be a big league starter, but that's the only real concern. His size also makes him the player he is, as he's much quicker and more athletic than the typical catcher. He receives and blocks well, and he enhances solid arm strength with fast footwork and impressive accuracy -- which allowed him to throw out 51 percent of basestealers in 2016.PERSON excels at making contact at the plate and has walked (64) more than he has struck out (53) in his first two pro seasons. He uses a simple left-handed swing but can drive the ball on occasions and improved his slugging percentage at each of his first four Minor League stops, so he might be able to provide double-digit homers on an annual basis.",0
"Five years after PERSON went No. 1 overall in the PERSON, PERSON has another hard-throwing right-hander poised to go in the first round. Unlike PERSON, PERSON was a prospect in high school, too, though signability knocked him down to the 41st round in 2011. He can light up a radar gun like no other college arm in this year's PERSON, as he's capable of working in the mid 90s and hitting 98 mph with his fastball, with triple-digits within reach in shorter stints. PERSON has a lot of moving parts in his delivery and still is learning to control his 6-foot-6 frame, so he lacks consistency with the rest of his pitches as well as his control and command. His low-80s slider has the most potential of his secondary offerings, and he also throws a curveball and a changeup. PERSON moved to the bullpen this spring and was throwing well as PERSON's closer. If he can't develop a reliable second weapon and do a better job of locating his pitches, that could be his long-term role at the next level.",0
"Signed for $1.1 million in mid-July, PERSON had an eye-opening instructional league. His range, hands, actions and arm are all easy fits at shortstop, and he could be a plus glove there at peak. His entire offensive profile depends on his frame filling out. PERSON's lack of strength is evident with the bat in his hands, but you can go kind of nuts projecting on much of his skillset, including the speed and arm strength, because PERSON so clearly has lots of physical growth on the horizon and is an above-average athlete. He's so young that he wasn't even eligible to sign on July 2nd because he was still 15. Were he a domestic high schooler, he wouldn't be draft eligible until 2020, when he'd be just shy of 18. His development may initially be slow, but he has significant literal and figurative growth potential and a non-zero shot to be a well-rounded shortstop at peak.  ",0
" Coming from the GPE Virgin Islands, PERSON obviously didn't have a ton of top-level baseball experience. But he may have found a home, and a way to move quickly, coming out of the bullpen. The ORGANIZATION initially wanted PERSON to get some time as a starter so he could build up some innings. That plan was scrapped heading into 2014 and his first taste of full-season ball. The ORGANIZATION decided to see how his stuff would play full-time out of the bullpen and it turned out to be a ridiculously good fit. Coming over the top in his delivery, PERSON' 93-95 mph fastball is deceptive, making it seem even harder. He has a plus changeup, with a 15-mph separation from his fastball, that hitters just can't see from that arm slot. His breaking ball is serviceable, but it's that fastball-changeup combination that has allowed him to miss so many bats.The ORGANIZATION added PERSON to the 40-man roster, sure someone would take a chance on him in the Rule 5 Draft, and he received a surprise callup to the big leagues for a game in June.",1
"PERSON was a mid-tier prospect in high school and took a big step forward as a freshman at ORGANIZATION, developing the raw power to be more than just a catch-and-throw type. He still didn't put up much in the way of traditional statistical production until the second half of his draft year, which amazingly occurred after a quick return from a broken hamate bone. PERSON' frame is compact and stout, and his bat's impact is a question mark, but he has everyday tools.",0
"PERSON had a breakout campaign on the Cape after his freshman year and, while he's lost a step since then, he still may be able to play second base and he has one of the most advanced bats in the draft.",1
"For the second time in five years, GPE PERSON could have a shortstop selected in the first round. PERSON isn't as tooled up as PERSON or the other top shortstops in a deep college crop, but he has a high floor as a steady up-the-middle defender with surprising power. He was one of four players to hit 10 or more homers in GPE Coast Conference games in 2018, joining PERSON. 2 overall pick PERSON, PERSON first-rounder PERSON and PERSON second-rounder PERSON Conine.Though he's not physically imposing, PERSON has quick hands and deceptive strength that give him at least above-average raw power. A right-handed hitter, he has a knack for putting the barrel on the ball. He shows the ability to hit for average and power, and he has done a better job of drawing walks this spring despite his aggressive approach.The biggest knock on PERSON is his below-average speed. Most big league shortstops run better than that, though some scouts think he can stay at the position because he has quick actions and hands. Others believe his speed and average arm will land him at second base, where he played as a freshman and still would profile well offensively.",1
"A small middle infielder with sparkplug type skills, GPE has shown a penchant for playing above his tools against very good competition.The high school shortstop was a standout for ORGANIZATION's 18 and Under team last summer on both sides of the ball. He handles the bat well putting the ball in play consistently; he didn't strike out once with PERSON. He's not particularly physical and power will never be a part of his game, leading to more PERSON comps than, say, PERSON or PERSON. He has plenty of speed and maximizes it as a base-stealing threat. The ORGANIZATION State commit has the tools to stay at shortstop thanks to his quickness and accuracy, though without pure arm strength. He's a natural leader and a coach on the field from short.Teams will have to look past GPE's size and project some added strength when deciding to take him. With his tools and plus makeup, he's the type who proves any skeptics wrong.",0
"PERSON (pronounced with a vowel sound like 'plow' or 'allow') was an under-the-radar, bat-first prospect at ORGANIZATION who the ORGANIZATION picked in the third round. He has always been a second baseman but was never the pedigree type given his position and average at best speed, defense, and arm. He also tore his ORGANIZATION as a freshman. His indicators were positive--plate discipline, contact skills, bat speed, enough power to profile--and we were high on PERSON entering the year, pegging him as a 45 FV. He went off in 2018, following a fine Double-A look in 2017 by demolishing the level in 2018, then performing even better at Triple-A, earning a big league look, where he put up almost 1.0 WAR in just 43 games. The offense has taken off even more than those highest on him internally had expected, with some chance for 50 hit and 60 game power with passable defense at second, along with versatility to play left field and possibly first base if needed. PERSON is now in the weird prospect spot where he isn't the highly-drafted, tooled-up brand name type you typically find in the middle of a top 100, but he's about as low risk of a bat as there is with prospect eligibility, and he can also play up the middle, so his six years of control have tons of value to a small market team like the ORGANIZATION.",1
"Walters State (Tenn.) CC had two early-round picks in the 2014 Draft, and both are off to promising starts in pro ball. Right-hander Brent PERSON became the second-highest pick in GPE history when the ORGANIZATION grabbed him in the second round, and PERSON became the third-highest when the ORGANIZATION took him in the fourth.PERSON's best pitch is his curveball, a plus offering when at its best with power and depth. He has added some fastball velocity since signing and now works in the low 90s and touches 95 mph with some cutting and tailing action when he keeps the pitch down in the strike zone. He also has improved his feel for a sinking changeup.PERSON has gotten stronger since signing and still has room for more projection on his athletic 6-foot-4 frame. He has made strides with his control and command as well and has the potential to blossom into a mid-rotation starter if he keeps getting better. Hitters have difficulty handling his pitches because his high-three-quarters delivery creates deception and plane.",1
"PERSON figured they would be spending a lot of time at ORGANIZATION in GPE to see lefty PERSON and his teammate PERSON this spring. PERSON went down with PERSON surgery and while PERSON has been healthy, his inconsistent performance at the plate has left some scouts scratching their heads.There have been times the ORGANIZATION All GPE has shown offensive ability, barreling up the baseball well and showing some power as well. But evaluators don't love the swing and aren't sure how it will play at the next level. A shortstop in high school, most see a move to third in his future, where he has a good chance to be an above-average defender.It will be a team that believes in the bat that will take PERSON in the top five rounds. It also might have to be a team with multiple picks and bonus pool creativity, as it might take an above-value deal to sign PERSON away from attending PERSON.",0
"Teams that like speed will certainly spend time in GPE at ORGANIZATION, alma mater of previous top Draft prospects like PERSON in 2012, PERSON in '09 and PERSON in '02.That's where PERSON currently patrols center field. He profiles as a top-of-the-order type, a guy who will use his speed on both sides of the ball to be a basestealing threat and an excellent defender in the outfield. He's a slashing slap-and-run hitter with a short stroke that sprays line drives at times.PERSON is an outstanding athlete who reminds some of a ORGANIZATION or PERSON Revere-type player who can become a tablesetter atop a big league lineup in the future.",0
"So conservative was PERSON' swing when he first arrived in the states that ORGANIZATION coaches were trying to make adjustments to his lower-half use in the middle of games in the hopes that it would unlock power that was clearly dormant in his hands. He has good control of the strike zone and feel to hit for a teenager but despite playing some second and third, he may ultimately wind up at first base. If that's the case, a change that enables the power is necessary.",0
"Since the ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON from his GPE high school, he's performed well with largely average stuff. That hasn't kept him from being in demand, as he's been traded twice, first from the M's to the ORGANIZATION following the 2016 season, then again from GPE to the ORGANIZATION in the ORGANIZATION deal for PERSON. In 2017, PERSON showed his feel for pitching would work at the upper levels, pitching well for both the ORGANIZATION' and ORGANIZATION' Double-A affiliates while topping 150 innings for the second straight season and finishing an astounding 19-1. His walk rate did spike a bit following the trade, but there's confidence he'll return to the guy who has walked just 2.2 per nine innings in his pro career. His fastball is average velocity-wise, in the low-90s, but it plays up because of his command and life. His curve flashes plus and is his best secondary offering and his changeup gives him a third at least average offering. PERSON mixes his pitches well and gets a ton of groundball outs.PERSON's ability to work ahead and command the ball is the key to his future success. The ORGANIZATION were excited to have PERSON, who has the ceiling of a No. 4 type starter, in their system for a full season and he received his first big league callup in June.",1
"GPE's stuff went from electric in the summer before his prep draft year to pedestrian in college, but ticked back up to it's highest levels in the last few weeks.",0
"Born in GPE, PERSON attended high school in GPE. His elbow blew out when he was a senior, just as he was experiencing an uptick in velocity. WHen he returned, so did his mid-90s fastball. PERSON was traded as part of a package for several good A's relievers. He's advanced from a stuff and pitchability standpoint, enabling him to succeed at Double-A already at age 20. He's a potential mid-rotatino starter.",0
"If not for suffering a left ORGANIZATION tear during a rundown in early May, PERSON, who had a 23-game hit streak at the time, probably would have debuted in 2018 due to PERSON's middle infield woes. Instead, PERSON missed much of the season and is on track for a likely 2019 debut. He'll be the first native GPE to play in the majors. PERSON was acquired (along with PERSON) as part of a lopsided package for PERSON. His elite hand-eye coordination and bat control drive a contact-oriented offensive profile. Since coming over from GPE, PERSON has thickened his once frail-looking frame and improved upon some of the things that limited his in-game power. He was rotating better early in 2018, with the timing of his hip/hand spearation being better, too, and he was no longer ditching his leg kick with two strikes. His 2016 GPE and 2017-2018 ORGANIZATION slugging outputs are probably cariacatures of his true talent level, but PERSON should at least have doubles power. Defensively, PERSON is passable at shortstop and second base. He saw time in center field during the 2016 Fall League but hasn't played there since. Lots of scouts like him as a super utility type, but PERSON will be 25 in July and he hasn't played anywhere other than the middle infield at any point in his career, save for that Fall League. It's more likely he gets a chance to be PERSON's everyday shortstop in 2019 and, provided he hasn't lost a step due to the ORGANIZATION tear, we like him as a low-end regular there. ",0
"The ORGANIZATION went high-risk, high-reward when they took PERSON, the GPE high school standout, in the second round, and gave him a well over-slot bonus of $2 million to keep him from heading to GPE PERSON. His pro debut showed there's much work to be done and he repeated the rookie-level ORGANIZATION in 2015.Right now, PERSON is a bit of an all-or-nothing hitter. He has tremendous raw power and a ton of bat speed, with a lot of force and explosion in his swing. He will have to improve his pitch recognition and overall approach considerably for him to be able to progress so he can make more contact and tap into that power. PERSON does have a right fielder's arm, but his below-average speed does limit his range somewhat. PERSON will be the key for PERSON and he's far from a can't-miss prospect. But if it clicks, he's the type of high-ceiling player who could have a huge impact in a lineup.",0
"PERSON is an exception to the rule that high school second basemen aren't usually highly regarded as top pro prospects. His stock soared right before the 2013 Draft, and the ORGANIZATION didn't let him get past their second-round pick at ORGANIZATION. 66 overall.PERSON continued to raise his profile in pro ball, leading the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League with six home runs and a .924 ORGANIZATION. He has struggled in low Class A in 2014, but his bat-on-ball skills and his plus speed should help hit for average as he climbs the ladder. PERSON also has wiry strength and good pop for a middle infielder.PERSON's high baseball IQ and athleticism make him a fine defender at second base. He has quick feet and turns the double play well. GPE may give PERSON a chance to show what he can do at shortstop.",0
"The ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON after his 2017 freshman season, but he went back to school, raised his stock, and was the first ORGANIZATION arm off the board the following year. He has power stuff -- 93-96 with cut action at times, and a plus curveball -- but is wild and may be a reliever, though probably a very good one.",0
"PERSON began his post-high school career on the junior college circuit, at ORGANIZATION State College in GPE. He transferred to PERSON and pitched in relief as a junior, albeit not with good results. The ORGANIZATION liked his stuff enough to take a flier on him in the 30th round of the 2017 Draft. After being sent out as a reliever during his pro debut, PERSON got a chance to start and ran with it, pitching his way across three levels and finishing the year in Double-A.PERSON relies heavily on a fastball-splitter-changeup trio to get hitters out. He'll throw his fastball in the low-90s with occasional life. His split-finger changeup is his out pitch, and it's a good one, thrown in the low-80s with tumble that can miss bats and get weak contact. He mixes in a breaking ball as well and has shown the ability to throw strikes, with all three pitches coming from a quick and repeatable delivery.In all likelihood, PERSON ends up back in the bullpen, where his fastball-split combination could play up. His success as a starter has opened some eyes, and at the very least, he has shown he could be a multi-inning reliever.",0
"The younger brother of GPE pitching prospect PERSON, PERSON might offer more arm strength than his older brother did at this age, but with less feel for pitching.There is a lot to like about the younger PERSON, starting with the flashes of his plus fastball. Early on, PERSON was throwing his heater in the 94-97 mph range, and with good movement at times. He would couple that with a decent breaking ball and even an occasional, albeit inconsistent, changeup. As the spring wore on, PERSON was throwing more in the 90-93 mph range. That, plus his spotty command caused by some delivery issues, likely didn't help his draft stock.At 6-foot-4, PERSON is ""what they look like,"" with room to fill out that ideal pitcher's frame. At some point, a team is going to want to take on that project and try to sign him away from the ORGANIZATION of GPE.",0
"When the ORGANIZATION made the decision to blow well past their international bonus allocation for the 2015-16 signing period, their four pool slots (used to determine their spending allowance) held little value to them. They traded all of them, sending three worth a total of $1,071,300 to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON and infielder PERSON and the fourth to the ORGANIZATION for right-hander PERSON and outfielder PERSON. A second-round pick in 2012, PERSON jumped to high Class A after the deal and helped PERSON win the GPE League title.PERSON is more about polish than power, with his downer curveball qualifying as his lone above-average pitch. He gets good downhill plane on his 88-92 mph fastball, but the pitch lacks life and may not miss many bats at higher levels. His fringy changeup shows some fade and could improve if he used it more often. PERSON has good feel for pitching and always has filled the strike zone. He's an extreme flyball pitcher with a career 0.69 groundout/airout ratio, a cause for concern now that PERSON is playing as one of the best home run parks in the ORGANIZATION. There's still room for some projection in his 6-foot-4 frame, but unless he adds some power to his pitches his ceiling will be limited to GPE. 4 starter.",1
"PERSON opted to return to PERSON for his senior year after being selected in the 18th round in 2016. He immediately improved his stock by hitting .374 to capture the ORGANIZATION batting title, and then followed it with a .315 average and 19 steals as a senior. He ended up signing with ORGANIZATION for $50,000 as their third-round pick in 2017, though a minor injury from PERSON's college season kept him from making his pro debut. After a solid if unspectacular first full season at ORGANIZATION A Hagerstown, PERSON advanced to ORGANIZATION A Advanced Potomac in 2019 and garnered midseason All-Star honors in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON is a sum of all parts player who knows how to get the most out of his modest tools. As an undersized right-handed hitter, PERSON focuses on making line-drive contact and putting the ball in play so as to utilize his plus speed. He has pop to the gaps but little-to-no home-run power. He shows instincts, range and soft hands at second base, and he's increased his versatility in 2019 with reps in center field, where his wheels make him a rangy defender. PERSON's lack of impact potential at the plate limits his overall ceiling, but he does enough things well to conceivably reach the Majors in a utility role.",0
"Signed as a skinny infielder at age 17 in July 2013 and immediately transitioned to the mound, PERSON has added size and strength to his 6-foot-1 frame over time. A big '17 that saw him go to the ORGANIZATION, lead the organization in strikeouts and get added to the 40-man roster put him more firmly on the map. He reached Double-A in 2018, but wasn't nearly as dominant in the process.Stuff-wise, PERSON has more than enough to get big league hitters out. He has a lively fastball that he throws consistently up to the mid-90s that can miss bats and get weak contact on the ground. He'll show a plus curveball that can be a true out pitch and a changeup that might be above-average when all is said and done. The premium stuff can play down at times because of his below average command and control. He walked just over four per nine innings in 2018, in line with his career rate, though he really struggled to find the strike zone when he moved up to Double-A.PERSON has some effort to his delivery and can fly open at times, leading to those control problems. There's long been talk about him being a reliever in the future, where his outstanding stuff would play up and his durability could allow him to handle multiple innings.",1
"GPE has tracked as well as scouts could have hoped when he was a gangly, unrefined amateur outfielder. He's shown an ability to make mechanical adjustments and has now performed up through Triple-A, reducing his once concerning strikeout rate as he has climbed the minor league ladder. He'll likely get plenty of playing time with PERSON in 2018 and, though he make take some time to adjust to big league pitching, hit for plus power while playing center field.",1
"GPE spent most of his 2019 junior season injured, but has average stuff when healthy.",0
"From a pure raw tools standpoint, there weren't many better players in the 2013 Draft class than PERSON. In terms of performance, well, that's a different story.PERSON has the tools to do just about everything on the baseball field, but they didn't play out too consistently during his career at ORGANIZATION. The ORGANIZATION felt the athleticism was worth taking a shot in the second round. PERSON was having a strong pro debut before a knee injury ended his season. The approach was to simply throw him out there defensively and free up his offense, which worked initially. PERSON saw most of his game time in center field, got reps at shortstop and he played shortstop exclusively while performing well in his full-season debut.Wherever he ends up, the ORGANIZATION think PERSON is an up-the-middle athlete. If they can unlock the toolbox, the dividends could be huge.",1
"The ORGANIZATION aren't strangers in GPE, signing players like PERSON and ORGANIZATION in the past. PERSON is just getting going in his pro career, making a strong GPE debut in 2012, when he hit .343 in the ORGANIZATION and he continued to hit with a move up to the GPE League in 2013. He has a good approach at the plate and makes consistent contact, avoiding strikeouts, albeit without much power to date. PERSON played both shortstop and third in 2012, but has focused almost entirely at the middle infield spot in 2013. He has good actions and a strong arm and he'd have more value if he can stick at short.",1
"  Known as a heady player who gets the most out of his tools, PERSON made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in 2013. He wasn't able to break into the ORGANIZATION crowded outfield in 2014, instead spending the whole season with Triple-A Gwinnett, where he finished in the top 10 in the ORGANIZATION in hits and batting average, but he was back in GPE in 2015. PERSON's first move as general manager of the ORGANIZATION was to claim PERSON off waivers from the ORGANIZATION.A switch-hitter, PERSON makes consistent contact from both sides of the plate. He has minimal power, instead using his above-average speed to get on base and make things happen. He's a solid defender, capable of playing all three outfield positions. PERSON was able to break through into a less crowded outfield in 2015 and showed the ability to fill a role as a fourth outfielder type at the big league level.",1
"A bit of a late bloomer, PERSON didn't make the varsity team at GPE (Calif.) PERSON until his junior year. Despite his slow start, he established himself as an elite hitter in high school, and that carried over to the professional ranks, where he excelled as an 18-year-old in the ORGANIZATION before heading to the ORGANIZATION in the big December three-team deal that made PERSON a GPE Diego Padre.PERSON earns some comparisons to PERSON, a fellow GPE alumnus. He barrels up balls well with his short compact swing. PERSON has shown some power already, and scouts believe he'll be able to unlock more as he physically matures.PERSON is an excellent defender at first base, though he doesn't have the tools to play elsewhere. That means he'll have to keep hitting as he moves through the ORGANIZATION.",1
"GPE and pure stuff wise, ORGANIZATION looks like a top-notch pitching prospect at times. It's the ""at times"" part that has held him back. With really good pure stuff, ORGANIZATION has shown the ability to miss bats, striking out more than a batter per inning in each of the last two seasons. His fastball is a tick above-average, and he throws it downhill from his 6-foot-4 frame, but it's his changeup that is his out pitch. He also throws a slider, though it's behind the other two pitches. ORGANIZATION's biggest enemy has been his fastball command. When he can throw the pitch for strikes, with that changeup, he has the chance to excel. It just hasn't happened with any consistency as of yet. As a result, ORGANIZATION could end up in a bullpen, and he showed signs of it being a good fit in the ORGANIZATION. For now, though, he'll stay in a rotation and work on his fastball command.",0
"PERSON is a former hockey defenseman who brings that mentality to the mound, attacking hitters with three above average pitches and command. He attacks the zone with a low-90s sinker down in the zone and is a pitch efficient starter who isn't gunning for the strikeout. He's also a shorter strider so his velocity plays down a bit, making his command and offspeed pitches even more important. PERSON's changeup went from rarely used to a pitch that flashes plus in the last year or so, and his high-spin hybrid breaking ball has always been a trusted secondary pitch. He missed much of 2018 with a muscular issue in his shoulder, but was ready to pitch in the big leagues in September, hitting the mid-90s in simulated games and only staying out of competitive contents because of the ORGANIZATION' cautious approach to his rehab.",1
"The ORGANIZATION have a number of young and intriguing pitchers from PERSON, and PERSON features the best combination of stuff and polish. Signed out of the ORGANIZATION in December 2014, he made his GPE debut last season and struck out 70 in 56 innings across three levels. PERSON has a strong arm that routinely delivers 93-95 mph fastballs and can hit the upper 90s. He does a nice job of locating his mid-80s slider, which is a plus pitch at times but slurvy at others. His changeup doesn't have enough separation from his fastball yet, but he isn't afraid to throw it and it figures to develop into an average offering.PERSON likes to challenge hitters and shows signs of being able to command his secondary pitches. He had trouble maintaining his stuff while pitching out of the stretch last summer, so PERSON had him address that problem by working solely out of the stretch during instructional league play -- and his fastball topped out at 99 mph. He has yet to reach full-season ball but the makings of a No. 3 starter are there.",0
"Despite hitting 98 mph with his fastball and flashing a hammer curveball as a high school senior, PERSON lasted 67 picks in the 2012 Draft because he lacked consistency. That same scouting report is true five years later, as he'll look like a frontline starter on some days and a middle reliever on others. He totaled just 315 innings in his first five pro seasons, missing time in 2015 and 2016 with elbow and forearm inflammation.When he's at his best, PERSON can display a double-plus fastball and a plus curveball and changeup. His fastball can sit at 93-95 mph and touches 97 with late life that generates ground balls, though he still has to prove he can hold that velocity deep into games and over a full season. His secondary pitches can be as erratic as they are promising, and he also has added a hard cutter that GPE may have him turn into a true slider. PERSON's control regressed last year and he gets hit more than his stuff indicates he should because his command is unreliable. His dedication to his conditioning and his rehab has frustrated the ORGANIZATION at times, and they're hoping that renewed focus will help him stay healthy and make improvements in 2017. He's still young and they haven't given up on him as a starter, but it's becoming increasingly likely that he'll wind up in the bullpen.",1
"In a year where a lot of the best college catching prospects are skewed heavily in favor of offense (PERSON's PERSON, GPE's PERSON) or defense (ORGANIZATION's PERSON), PERSON is one of the better all-around backstops available. He's a quality defender who has upped his offensive game as a junior.PERSON stands out most for his work behind the plate. He has solid arm strength and such a quick transfer that he consistently records pop times of 1.9 seconds or less and opponents rarely try to run on him. He's a good receiver who has more athleticism and agility than most backstops.After batting a combined .235 in his first two years at ORGANIZATION, PERSON has been one of the ORGANIZATION' most productive hitters this spring. He has a compact right-handed swing that lends itself to contact and getting on base, if not much power. He has at least average speed and can steal a base on occasion.",1
"Initially recruited by the ORGANIZATION of GPE as a third baseman, PERSON blossomed on the mound and some clubs thought PERSON was the best pitcher available in the 2012 Draft. The ORGANIZATION were delighted to grab him with the fifth overall selection and a $3 million bonus. They hoped he could contribute to their big league club by 2014 at the latest, but elbow, biceps, lat and shoulder woes limited him to 152 2/3 innings in his first three pro seasons, including just 4 2/3 last year. When healthy, PERSON fits the ace profile. He usually works at 93-97 with his fastball, which has reached triple digits, and his hammer curveball can be equally as devastating. Both his slider and changeup show the makings of becoming solid options as well.PERSON is also an outstanding athlete who repeats his delivery well, so he has no trouble throwing quality strikes. The ORGANIZATION hoped offseason arthroscopic surgery to clean up his shoulder would return him to full health, but he had a setback and didn't appear in a game until late May. PERSON opted to ease him back into action as a reliever but still envisions him as a starter in the long run.",0
"GPE went undrafted as a GPE high school outfielder in 2012 and couldn't get on the field as a Duke freshman the following spring. He transferred to PERSON (Fla.) CC because he wanted to pitch and immediately attracted scouts when he showed arm strength similar to that of his older brother PERSON, who's now with the ORGANIZATION. The second juco player drafted (third round) in 2014, GPE dominated PERSON A hitters when he became a full-time reliever last year but has seen his control disintegrate in 2017.After operating with an 88-92 mph fastball in his two seasons as a pro starter, GPE recaptured the velocity he flashed at PERSON when he moved to the bullpen. He now works at 94-97 mph and can hit 99 with some natural cutting action. He has scrapped an ineffective changeup in favor of a splitter that shows potential and is better than his soft curveball.There's a lot of effort in GPE's delivery, which hampers his control but does bolster his deception. He'll always be much more about power than finesse, but he'll have to find the strike zone much more consistently to realize his upside of a set-up man.",0
"PERSON was seen as a football-first prospect until late GPE 2018. He played at a couple of showcase events in the summer of 2017 and had some raw tools, but wasn't yet under consideration for the top few rounds of the baseball draft. He was, however, a top 100 football recruit, set to head to GPE to play wide receiver, where his father was on the coaching staff. Then in GPE, PERSON had a coming out party at the heavily-scouted ORGANIZATION tournament near his high school, fulfilling the rosiest hopes some had of him eventually putting it together on the baseball field, as multiple scouts from all 30 teams watched him against strong competition for a few days. Scouts were hesitant at first, worried they might be overreacting, but eventually came to think that PERSON' only athletic peer in recent draft history was PERSON. 
PERSON is a true 80 runner with raw power who projects to be a 60, and who flashed body and bat control that reminded scouts of PERSON. All of this excitement came with almost zero track record, and PERSON didn't face much strong competition after ORGANIZATION, meaning drafting him would be based purely on old-school scouting, as there weren't years of video of and performance from this flourishing incarnation of PERSON. Once teams became enthused enough that multiple millions of dollars were in play, it appeared clear that baseball could overtake football. Several ORGANIZATION, including the ORGANIZATION' GM PERSON, were in after ORGANIZATION to see PERSON for themselves, and after ORGANIZATION and PERSON were their top pick in consecutive years, rival executives now view this risk/upside kind of prospect as GPE' type. That trend appears to be more the result of opportunistic good fortune than a deliberate strategy, since there's an argument to be made that PERSON (who went to GPE sixth overall in 2017) had less upside and a similar performance record to PERSON; if the industry had simply seen PERSON play in an ORGANIZATION-style setting for a couple more weeks, he could have been a top five pick candidate, just like PERSON or PERSON were after a strong summer of performance. This is all to say that the sky is the limit for PERSON, and if he performs well in Low-A in 2019, he'll shoot up this list.",0
"After an exciting showing during minor league spring training, PERSON struggled throughout the summer as he made swing change after swing change after swing change. It makes much more sense to tinker and find the right swing sooner rather than later, but PERSON hit just .199 as he was asked to bring his side work onto the field during the summer. He had no fewer than four different cuts during 2018, and at times seemed so out of whack that pro scouts in GPE began to actively steer clear of PERSON to avoid falling out of love with a player they were so enamored with during the spring. That player took your breath away when he'd hit his stride going from first to third, looked like he might be a black hole defender in center field because of his range, and was going to have power once the swing was refined. 
If evaluating purely on physical ability, PERSON belongs up near PERSON and PERSON in this system, but his 2018 was a bit of a red flag and he's probably going to be a long-term developmental project.  ",0
"The ORGANIZATION surprised other clubs by selecting PERSON eighth overall in 2013, a move designed to save money to afford PERSON in the supplemental first round, but also made because they believed he was a legitimate first-round talent. He advanced to Double-A midway through his first full pro season, but floundered there for the rest of 2014 and all of 2015 when he messed up his swing by trying to hit home runs. He stopped selling out for power in 2016 -- and he made his big league debut after leading PERSON farmhands with 23 homers.PERSON has more than enough strength and loft in his right-handed stroke to deliver at least average power without swinging for the fences. He finally realized that last year, when he shortened his swing and used the entire field instead of trying to pull most pitches out of the park. Not coincidentally, he cut his strikeout rate from 29 percent in 2015 to 23 percent in 2016.A shortstop at PERSON, PERSON moves well for his size, has an arm that delivered low-90s fastballs when he pitched in college and is a capable third baseman. Because PERSON already has PERSON and PERSON at the hot corner, PERSON began seeing time on the outfield corners last year and could become a decent defender there with more experience. He hasn't gotten much of a chance to play anywhere in 2017, missing most of the first two months with an oblique strain and then sustaining a hamate injury two weeks after his return.",0
"Had he been considered signable, PERSON could have been a top-five-rounds pick as a GPE high schooler in 2013. He turned down the ORGANIZATION as a 25th-rounder and headed to GPE, a move that looked like it could pay off with him being selected as high as No. 1 overall in 2016. Instead he has become the biggest enigma in the GPE, still showing ace-level pure stuff but also an utter lack of control that got him banished to low-leverage relief for five weeks and resulted in an overall 3-5, 5.40 record.PERSON still can light up radar guns like few pitchers in this GPE crop, sitting at 94-97 mph and reaching 99 with some running life. He throws both an upper-70s curveball and a mid-80s slider, with the latter more formidable and featuring late tilt. He even has the makings of at least an average changeup.PERSON has exciting raw stuff, but his red flags are daunting. He has little history of throwing strikes because he struggles to repeat a delivery in which his upper and lower halves are often out of sync and he doesn't stay online toward home plate. There also are worries about his long-term health after he took the summer off and then was shut down in the fall with forearm tightness.",0
"Selected in the fifth round of the 2011 Draft out of GPE (GPE) High, PERSON made a steady climb through the ORGANIZATION before breaking out between Double-A PERSON and Triple-A Colorado Springs in 2015. The ORGANIZATION rewarded the athletic outfielder with an unexpected callup in September, though he was back in Triple-A to begin the 2016 season. PERSON stands out for his contact skills and advanced plate discipline, as he's piled up walks and posted high on-base percentages at every stage of his career. Though he struck out quite a bit at the outset of his career, PERSON was able to reduce his strikeout rate last season in the high minors. He has a short, compact swing from the right side that yields lines drives and consistent gap power, and some evaluators believe that, based on his physicality, he'll eventually show more over-the-fence pop. An above-average runner, PERSON has good instincts on the bases and has proven to be a legitimate base-stealing threat, swiping at least 25 bags in each of the last three years.PERSON is fast enough to play center field and has the necessary arm strength for right, but his lack of power might keep him from regular playing time. Whether he can put it all together and achieve an everyday role remains to be seen, but PERSON has a solid floor of a productive fourth outfielder to fall back on.",1
"Though PERSON entered 2015 as the top position-player prospect among ORGANIZATION high schoolers, PERSON has passed him this spring. While PERSON offers more power, PERSON is a better hitter and has a significantly better chance at remaining at third base.With his sweet left-handed swing and sound approach, PERSON has the tools to hit for average. While he doesn't drive the ball consistently yet, he should in the future because he has a quick bat and plenty of room to add strength to his 6-foot-3 frame.A good athlete who has seen time at shortstop and pitcher and also played basketball and football, PERSON profiles well at third base. The ORGANIZATION recruit has a solid arm and a quick first step, though he'll need to refine his footwork at the hot corner.",0
"Coming into the 2014 season, scouts were split on whether PERSON was a better prospect as a pitcher or a third baseman. By the end of the spring, he stood out more on the mound, and he became the third first-round pitcher out of the Harvard-Westlake School in GPE, GPE, in the past three Drafts -- following PERSON (ORGANIZATION) and PERSON (ORGANIZATION). The 34th overall pick in June, PERSON gave up a GPE scholarship to sign for $2 million.PERSON translates his excellent athleticism into a smooth delivery that he repeats well and allows him to throw strikes with four pitches. He projects to add more velocity as he fills out and he focuses on pitching, so he could have three plus offerings down the road. PERSON's changeup is his best pitch. He also has a fastball that reaches 93 mph, an improving slider and a get-me-over curveball.As a third baseman, PERSON projected as a quality defender with gap power. He has a ceiling as a No. 2 or 3 starter on the mound, and he could move quickly given his advanced feel for pitching.",1
"PERSON made a name for himself on the national stage last summer, winning the junior portion of the All-Star Game ORGANIZATION by bashing 13 homers with a metal bat at ORGANIZATION in July. A month later, he won the ORGANIZATION at the Under PERSON All-America Game at FACILITY. PERSON has tremendous power and bat speed, not to mention quality athleticism and arm strength. The best-case scenario is that he develops into an annual 30-homer hitter as a big league shortstop. Whether he realizes that upside depends on how much he develops at the plate and how much weight he'll eventually pack on his lean 6-foot-5 frame. Concerns about his hit tool were impacting his ORGANIZATION stock a bit as the spring progressed.The LOCATION recruit has a busy setup at the plate and can struggle with his timing. He definitely has the arm for shortstop, but his speed and defense may not be more than average, which could eventually lead to a move to third base.",0
"When you're a slightly undersized infielder who is known as a gamer in the ORGANIZATION system, chances are you're going to be compared to PERSON. PERSON, of course played 10 years in the big leagues and while it's too early to predict a similar outcome with the ORGANIZATION' sixth-round pick from 2015, he headed in the right direction by making it to Double-A in his first full season.PERSON didn't start out well at all as he tried to play through multiple injuries, particularly a wrist issue he didn't want to disclose was bothering him as much as it was. After he missed more than a month, things started to click and he had a very strong second half that carried him up to the ORGANIZATION. PERSON has very good contact skills and a patient approach at the plate, putting the ball in play, albeit without much power, and rarely striking out. His arm at shortstop is average at best, but it's accurate, while his instincts and quick hands allow him to stay at the position. He'll have to prove at every level that he can play there, though he's also shown he can handle second base without too much difficulty.Now in the upper levels of the system, PERSON isn't too far off from contributing to the big league roster. It might be as a valuable utilityman, but don't be surprised if he carves out a regular role at some point.",1
"  PERSON had a productive college career at GPE and helped the ORGANIZATION to a runner-up finish at the 2014 College World Series. PERSON viewed him as an advanced hitter, and the GPE agreed, sending him to low Class A Lake County for his professional debut after he signed for $1.25 million as a supplemental first-rounder. At GPE, PERSON was one of the best hitters in college baseball. He showed excellent plate discipline and pitch recognition, hit line drives to all fields with a balance left-handed swing and displayed promising power potential. Outside of drawing walks, he hasn't looked like the same guy as a pro, striking out more than expected and often making weak contact when he puts the ball in play.PERSON primarily played first base as a junior, but the GPE returned him to the outfield, where he played earlier in his career. His arm and athleticism are both good enough to make him a capable corner outfielder.",0
"Â As a starter at UMass-Lowell in 2011, PERSON struck out 12.7 batters per nine innings, the second-best mark in GPE II. A move to the bullpen in the ORGANIZATION has only helped his strikeout numbers, as he averaged 14.8 strikeouts per nine innings in his first two full professional seasons.Â PERSON's delivery makes it difficult for left-handers and right-handers alike to pick up the ball against him, rendering his fastball-curveball combination nearly unhittable. His low-90s fastball has enough tailing life to generate swings and misses, and his hard curveball gives him a good second pitch. PERSON also occasionally mixes in a changeup.Â While PERSON's stuff is good, his below-average control can get him in trouble. If he can tighten it just a bit, he'll soon be ready for the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON has hit everywhere he's gone since the ORGANIZATION drafted him 37th overall in 2010. PERSON hopes that will continue in its system after the club acquired him as part of the trade that sent PERSON to GPE in July.PERSON doesn't have any real standout tools; instead, he is a steady all-around performer. He has a knack for putting the bat on the ball, despite an unconventional timing mechanism in his swing. PERSON is an aggressive hitter, and he has developed solid power as he has matured.PERSON is a below-average runner, limiting his range defensively. Still, he has the hands and footwork necessary to be an average defender at second base. PERSON earns praise for his makeup, and he knows how to get the most out of his tools. He profiles as an offensive-minded second baseman.",0
"PERSON had more offensive upside than most of the high school catchers in the 2017 Draft, but the ORGANIZATION product resisted seven-figure overtures from big league clubs in order to stay home and attend ORGANIZATION. He still is known more for his bat, though he has gotten better behind the plate this spring after spending most of his freshman season at ORGANIZATION. Whether he'll be signable this time around as a sophomore-eligible remains to be seen.PERSON stands out as a lefty-hitting catcher with the ability to handle the bat. He regularly puts the barrel on the ball, uses the entire field and manages the strike zone well. He has more strength than bat speed and possesses solid raw power, though he's more concerned with making quality contact than swinging for the fences.If PERSON can continue to improve his defense, he has a chance to become a big league regular. He looks quicker and more agile than he did in high school, though his receiving skills are fringy and need more work. He has similar arm strength but his quick release helps him keep the running game in check.",0
"The FACILITY Sox have been rebuilding their Latin GPE program since a bonus-skimming scandal ruined it in 2008, and their biggest move since then came in July 2013. PERSON landed PERSON, ORGANIZATION's ORGANIZATION. 2-ranked international prospect, for $1.6 million. He's still just 18, and scouts inside and outside the organization speculate that he could have been the ORGANIZATION. 1 overall pick in the 2015 Draft if he were a GPE high school senior.Adolfo has immense power potential that results from bat speed, long levers, good loft in his right-handed swing and projectable strength. He's still learning at the plate, as evidenced by his Rookie-level ORGANIZATION League-leading 85 strikeouts in 46 games in his pro debut. He'll need to improve his pitch recognition to fully tap into his all-fields pop.Adolfo's arm strength is nearly as impressive as his raw power, making him a natural for right field. That's where he played in his debut, though he showed the aptitude for center field during instructional league and will get time more there in 2015. Presently a solid runner, he figures to lose a step once he matures physically.",0
"For whatever reason, hitting prospects in the ORGANIZATION organization tend to struggle when they first get to Triple-A Louisville. PERSON, for instance, hit under .200 his first two months of his first full year at the level in 2010. PERSON suffered the same fate in 2012 but recovered and made his Major ORGANIZATION debut in 2013. While he's a fringy hitter, there's no doubting his right-handed power, notably to the opposite field. His bat could get him to the big leagues, though he's limited to first base and is blocked in GPE by that PERSON fellow.",1
"GPE had the chance to join the pro ranks when he was coming out of high school in GPE, but instead opted to head to GPE. He threw just four innings as a freshman in 2016, so he transferred to the ORGANIZATION of GPE to be PERSON eligible this June.GPE pitched very well in the ORGANIZATION this summer and has continued to show premium velocity in junior college this spring. He was touching 97 mph in fall ball and has kept that up during the regular season in GPE. He complements it with a true 12-to-6 power curve which flashes plus on occasion, and he'll also show some feel for his changeup, though it's behind the other two pitches. While he has a very quick and clean arm delivery, his command comes and goes and his fastball can be flat at times, though that hasn't kept him from missing a ton of bats this spring.The lack of track record, as well as the inconsistency with his delivery and command, might concern some, with scouts wondering if he's a starter or a reliever long term. This kind of arm strength from the left side is hard to find, so teams won't too long to take him off the board.",0
"ORGANIZATION registered on the national scene in 2014 when he threw a complete-game shutout in the ORGANIZATION World Series, capping off two years of effective starting for a top-notch GPE program. His junior season was not as effective, but the ORGANIZATION thought enough of him to take him in the fifth round and watched him turn in another gem in GPE before signing in mid-July. He handled an assignment to the Class A Advanced PERSON to begin his first full season without difficulty, earning a promotion after just five starts. Double-A initially proved to be a stiffer challenge, but the left-hander appeared to be making adjustments as the year progressed. ORGANIZATION is the quintessential pitchability college lefty. When he's on his game, he's a master strike-thrower with a solid three-pitch mix. He'll throw his fastball in the 89-91 mph range and do a very good job of mixing in his slider and changeup to keep hitters off balance. His command suffered as a junior, partially because of pitch selection and partially because of a blister issue that bothered him on and off throughout his college career. Part of his problems in Double-A revolved around difficulties finding the strike zone. There is some projection to ORGANIZATION and his 6-foot-3 frame. Even with his inconsistencies, his track record says he has every chance to start at the big league level, albeit with the ceiling of a No. 4 or 5 starter.",0
"PERSON was old enough to turn pro in 2008, yet no one signed him out of GPE until the ORGANIZATION handed him a meager $7,500 bonus at the relatively advanced age of 20 four years later. He has earned league all-star recognition in each of his two pro seasons and led the low Class A GPE ORGANIZATION with a 2.45 ERA when he made his full-season debut in 2014. His transition to high Class A in 2015 did not gone well, however, and PERSON traded him to the ORGANIZATION for PERSON de Aza at the end of August.PERSON slings the ball with a lot of effort from a low slot, which doesn't look pretty but generates plenty of velocity. He works at 91-94 mph and can hit 97 with his fastball. Both of his secondary pitches show solid-or-better potential, with his changeup more reliable than his slider at this point. His delivery leads to questions about durability and makes it tough to repeatedly stay on top of his pitches, costing PERSON some control and command. He has seen time as both a starter and reliever in 2015, and the latter role could be his future. He could be a devastating specialist because his power and arm slot make him tough on lefties.",0
"PERSON was nearly 21, ancient by international amateur standards, when he signed for $50,000 out of the ORGANIZATION in 2015. Despite his advanced age, the ORGANIZATION have had to bring him along slowly, and he didn't reach full-season ball until last year. He's still very raw but made some progress in transitioning from thrower to pitcher.PERSON has an electric fastball that parks at 95-98 mph when he starts, touches 102 when he relieves and features quality running life. His upper-80s slider has more velocity than bite but operated as a solid second pitch more often in 2017. His changeup has a chance to become an average offering.Though the ORGANIZATION have deployed PERSON as a starter to give him innings and make him develop his secondary pitches, he'll almost certainly be a reliever in the long run. He's still learning to repeat his mechanics and may never have average control or command. It would be easier to keep his delivery in sync in shorter stints and he'd likely sit in the upper 90s with his heater.",0
"The decision to sign free agent PERSON kept the Brewers from drafting in the first round in 2013. When it came time for them to make their first pick in the second round, they took the ultra-projectable PERSON. The right-hander spent two seasons in GPE ball before making his full-season debut in 2015, when he recorded a 3.44 ERA and struck out an even 9.0 batters per nine innings at ORGANIZATION A Wisconsin. He began 2016 in extended spring training as the result of a minor shoulder injury before picking up where he left off in the ORGANIZATION. PERSON may still be in the early stages of development, but he has as much upside as any arm in the system. He will sit in the low 90s with his fastball but can touch 95 mph at times, and with added strength to his frame, he could add a tick or two velocity-wise. Both his mid-80s slider, which can be a little slurvy at times, and his deceptive, sinking changeup have the chance to be at least PERSON average. PERSON made strides with his control in 2014 only to regress in that department last season, when he walked 3.6 batters per nine innings and paced the ORGANIZATION with 19 wild pitches. However, given his overall athleticism and loose arm, he should be able to learn to repeat his delivery well enough to develop solid command.With a clean and easy delivery, a projectable body, and a potential three-pitch mix, PERSON has the look of future a mid-rotation starter.",0
" The fact Stripling didnât sign with the ORGANIZATION as a junior and returned to PERSON A&M for his senior year looks like it could really work in the ORGANIZATIONâ favor. Though heâs âoldâ for a recent college senior, he hasnât been pitching for that long, only focusing on it beginning his senior year of high school. As expected, he absolutely dominated the ORGANIZATION, even though he was used sparingly. He has a three-pitch mix that he should be able to command well. His fastball can be above-average, touching plus at times, and his overhand curve is a future out pitch. His changeup gives him the chance at having a third average offering. He has a very good feel for pitching. He wonât be coming off a strenuous college season like he was in the summer of 2012, so the ORGANIZATION wonât hold him back. He could, as a result, move very quickly.",0
"PERSON was a standout in both baseball and hockey at ORGANIZATION (Conn.) Prep before he turned down the ORGANIZATION as a 23rd-round pick in 2014 in favor of his commitment to GPE. A three-year starter for the ORGANIZATION, he was ORGANIZATION's best hitter as a junior -- he led the team in all three slash categories (.354/.475/.602) and hit 12 homers -- and the A's made him their fourth-round pick that June. PERSON was in the second half of his first full season with PERSON when he was sent to the ORGANIZATION in GPE's PERSON trade. Promoted to Double-A upon joining GPE's system, he made a greater impact at the plate in the LOCATION than he had in the hitter-friendly GPE. PERSON controls the strike zone very well and shows power potential in his left-handed swing. He improved his walk and strikeout rates each year at ORGANIZATION and hit for more power than ever in 2017. He's been an on-base machine, but hasn't shown that pop as a pro, though the ORGANIZATION believe he'll develop more game power by incorporating better use of his lower half in his swing. While his power plays best to his pull side, PERSON hit his most impressive home runs to left-center field last season -- an encouraging sign for a player whose big league profile at the hot corner depends on his power output. Though he's a fringy runner, PERSON provides above-average defense and plus arm strength at third base.PERSON receives comparisons to PERSON as a left-handed-hitting third baseman who plays quality defense, gets on base consistently and has untapped potential with the bat. There is some question about whether he will hit for the average and power demanded of third basemen at higher levels, but even those who question his tools give him credit for his ability to process the game, his makeup and his competitiveness.",0
"Discovered in the ORGANIZATION after he slipped under draft radars for various reasons (including an early-career TJ), PERSON was signed as an undrafted free agent and, a year later, has reached theupper-levels of the minors. He has your typical, two-pitch middle relief look.",0
"GPE PERSON produced just three first-round picks in the first 49 Drafts, but the ORGANIZATION might have the first college pitcher (PERSON) and first college position player (PERSON) selected in 2014. Though PERSON stands out most for his top-of-the-scale speed, he's more than just a burner. With his wheels and ability to make contact and control the strike zone, he has the tools to become a quality leadoff hitter at the ORGANIZATION level. The key will be toning down his swing, which can get long, and his approach, which can get a little out of control. He can get home run-conscious and would be best served by focusing on getting on base, where his speed and instincts make him a prime basestealing threat. A third baseman as a freshman, PERSON moved to shortstop in 2013. He has the quickness and arm strength to stick at shortstop, something few college players do, though he needs to improve his defensive consistency.",1
"PERSON succeeded PERSON Series legend PERSON as GPE's No. 1 starter in 2013-14, pitching his way into the fourth round of the 2014 Draft. He has been as polished as advertised, meriting a promotion to high Class A two months into his first full pro season.PERSON is throwing a little bit harder in pro ball than he did in college, working at 88-92 mph and reaching the low 90s more often. His fastball never will be overpowering, yet it's quite effective because it runs and sinks, and he can locate it wherever he wants.His best pitch remains his changeup, and PERSON also mixes in a cutter and a curveball. He's a good athlete for his size and has clean mechanics, so he throws strikes with ease. While he may not be more than a back-of-the-rotation starter, he's a safe bet to reach that ceiling.",0
"PERSON came almost out of nowhere at a low-profile GPE junior college, going from unknown to a first round pick in less than a year, fueled by a dazzling pre-draft bullpen for scouts where he sat in the high-90's and hit 100 mph. At his best, PERSON looks like a front-of-the-rotation monster, with a strudy frame, long stride, powerful delivery and triple digit heat, to go with a slider and changeup that have flashed 60 at their best. On the other hand, there's risk with hard throwers, especially those with new velocity and PERSON has had control issues ever since his velocity spiked. He's trending in the right direction, though with his best appearances coming in May and June just before the draft, then a strong pro debut. PERSON has possibly the widest variance of potential outcomes of any player on this list.",0
"PERSON sat out for all of 2016 as a result of his decision to transfer from GPE, where he had appeared in 12 games out of the bullpen as a freshman, to PERSON & Mary. Though his numbers were uneven in his first season with The ORGANIZATION, PERSON's arm strength and deep arsenal caught the attention of the ORGANIZATION, who selected the redshirt sophomore in the third round. A physically strong and durable left-hander, PERSON operates in the low-to-mid 90s with his fastball and can reach back for 98 mph, all while maintaining his velocity deep into games. His changeup is his best secondary offering, one that receives above-average grades from scouts, and he also features a pair of average breaking balls in a curveball and a slider.PERSON has a knack for missing bats, evidenced by his 95 strikeouts in 77 1/3 innings during the spring, but he's currently a below-average strike-thrower. Learning to repeat his delivery as well as harnessing his stuff would bode well for his chances of remaining a starter, although there's little doubt among scouts that PERSON could move quickly in a bullpen role.",0
"With all of the exciting arms in the ORGANIZATION system, it was actually PERSON who led the organization in ORGANIZATION in 2014 and finished in the top five in a host of pitching categories. He wasn't able to replicate that success in Triple-A in 2015, though a move down to Double-A might have righted the ship.PERSON didn't even start at ORGANIZATION until his junior year, and now he's perhaps the most durable starter in the ORGANIZATION system, topping 150 innings in two of his first three full seasons. He relied on his fastball early in his career but used his three-pitch mix more consistently in 2014. His fastball grades out as just average, and he doesn't miss a ton of bats, but he does create angle using his 6-foot-6 frame. He has a decent breaking ball and a good feel for his changeup. He's generally around the strike zone but does need to be careful because without any plus pitches, he can be hittable. The ORGANIZATION added PERSON to the 40-man roster this past offseason and he has the chance to be a back-end starter or a lefty out of the 'pen.",0
"There are a good amount of college middle infielders who can hit in this year's PERSON class. While PERSON' progress in the field was held up by a labrum injury, he showed this spring that his ability to swing the bat generated plenty of interest.Originally a shortstop, PERSON had to DH for much of 2015 as he recovered from his shoulder issue. His return to the field has come at second base, where he has the chance to be a fair defender. His arm continues to come back, but will likely play no better than average. It will be PERSON' bat that will get him drafted and carry him up an organizational ladder. He has a very good approach at the plate, making consistently hard contact. More of an extra-base hit guy now, there is enough strength for some power in the future. As he's gotten bigger and stronger, he's slowed down to an average runner.College bats who perform always tend to do well in June, and a team seeing PERSON as an everyday offensive-minded second baseman could take him in the top few rounds.",0
"PERSON signed with GPE for $125,000 in the 10th round in 2016 out of a southern GPE high school. The report then was an explosive, quick second baseman with some tools who could use some refinement. That's still mostly the report, but PERSON's 2018 full season debut was excellent, hitting above league average in the ORGANIZATION as a 19-year-old most of the year, despite a .270 ORGANIZATION.  Some players naturally have a lower ORGANIZATION, but PERSON is a player who should have a higher-than-normal ORGANIZATION given his plus speed (44 stolen bases in 2018), solid plate discipline (11% BB to 19% K), and surprising game power for his size and age (nine home runs and 32 doubles). 
PERSON can still make a boneheaded play defensively, use improper footwork at the keystone, or try to do too much at the plate, but the tools are here for a low-end everyday second baseman if things continue progressing.",0
"His $185,000 bonus may have ranked just eighth among ORGANIZATION international signees during the 2013-14 period, but PERSON quickly established himself as the best prospect from that crop. After he made a strong GPE debut in 2015 and successfully navigated low Class A last year, the ORGANIZATION acquired him and fellow righty flamethrower PERSON in exchange for PERSON in November.PERSON's fastball has jumped from 87-91 mph when he turned pro to 93-98 these days, peaking at 100 and eliciting ground balls as well as swings and misses thanks to its sink and run. There's not much consensus on which is his best secondary pitch, because they all show potential yet also lack consistency. He throws two distinct power breaking balls as well as a fading changeup.PERSON has the potential to become a frontline starter, but he also gave a glimpse of his upside as a reliever by recording a 0.65 ORGANIZATION and a .481 opponents' OPS in eight bullpen appearances last year. GPE plans on keeping him in the rotation, and his quick arm and sound delivery fit in that role. To stay there, he'll need to improve his control and command while refining his secondary offerings.",0
"PERSON didn't begin pitching until his junior year at ORGANIZATION (Ill.) High, but he hit 94 mph as a senior in 2009 and touched 98 mph after transferring from GPE to GPE (GPE) JC in 2010. Ultimately signed for $50,000 as a 16th-round pick out of GPE in 2012, he struggled to harness his stuff in his first three years as a pro. He cleaned up his delivery and broke out at high Class A in 2015, earning a spot on the ORGANIZATION' 40-man roster. Strictly a reliever, PERSON works with two pitches. His fastball sits in the mid 90s and can reach triple digits, featuring good life to go with its plus-plus velocity. His mid-80s slider can be a wipeout pitch at times, but it lacks consistency and gets slurvy.PERSON's mechanics still aren't pretty, but he's doing a better job of taking a direct path to home plate and finding the strike zone. He walked just 2.5 batters per nine innings in 2015 after averaging 7.6 in his first three pro seasons, and he could advance quickly if he continues to throw strikes.",0
"  PERSON's first full professional season saw him start the All-Star Game for the GPE League before moving up to Double-A Pensacola for the second half. After his breakout year, the ORGANIZATION traded him to the Phillies in exchange for PERSON. None of PERSON's pitches jump off the page, but he does have four of them that he can throw for strikes. His fastball can touch 93-94 mph, and his slider has the potential to be an above-average pitch, as well. PERSON mixes in his curve and changeup well to keep hitters guessing. All of his stuff plays up because of the deception his unusual delivery creates, making it tough for hitters to pick up the ball.When he was a member of the ORGANIZATION system, PERSON was often compared to PERSON for his stuff and deception. It didn't take long for PERSON to get to the big leagues, and PERSON could be on a similar track.",0
"Because he hails from GPE, PERSON is going to draw the too-easy comparison to PERSON, who was signed by the ORGANIZATION back in 2007. The ORGANIZATION would love to see the middle infielder follow a similar path as the current ORGANIZATION shortstop.PERSON is similar to his fellow countryman in that he's an athletic infielder with very good defensive actions. He doesn't quite have PERSON' arm, but he has enough to stay at short, though he made multiple trips to the disabled list in 2016 with right shoulder issues.. The ORGANIZATION actually feel he has a better feel to hit and is a bit more consistent than PERSON was at the same stage of his career. A right-handed hitter, PERSON makes consistent contact and sprays the ball to all fields. He runs well enough to steal some bases once he gets on.The biggest key for PERSON, especially as he reaches the upper levels of the system, is to add strength. He's put on good weight as he's developed, but more needs to come if he's going to hit enough to be an everyday player at the big league level.",0
"A bat-first high school catcher who was considered a long shot to stay behind the plate, PERSON has made sufficient developmental progress as a defender and now projects to stay back there. Always in possession of a strong throwing arm, his once thick frame is now learner and more agile, enabling him to better handle the athletic burdens of catching. He also has huge raw power that he doesn't often get to in games because PERSON's bat path causes him to drive the ball into the ground at a 50% clip and he's also prone to swing and miss. Now that PERSON's defensive future is more in focus, he may just be a swing tweak away from a statistical breakout. ",0
"An Ontario native, PERSON signed with the ORGANIZATION for $25,000 as a 10th-rounder from ORGANIZATION in 2014, but he blew out his elbow shortly thereafter and missed the entire 2015 season following PERSON surgery. When he returned, PERSON made him a starter, a role he hadn't filled since he was a sophomore at ORGANIZATION State (Okla.) JC in 2013. Though he performed well in that role over the next three seasons, the ORGANIZATION didn't protect him on their 40-man roster and lost him in the Rule 5 Draft to the FACILITY, who sold him to the ORGANIZATION.PERSON's fastball sits comfortably at 92-94 mph, with good life and some run, and reaches 96 mph. His power slider gives him a second above-average pitch capable of missing bats, especially against right-handed hitters. Neither his curveball nor his changeup is particularly advanced, and he'll need to make the latter a viable offering to be successful against lefties at higher levels. Most scouts think that PERSON will eventually return to the bullpen given the proven effectiveness of his fastball-slider combo against same-sided hitters. The ORGANIZATION plan on giving him a chance to win a relief role in GPE Training. If he doesn't stick with the big league club, he has to clear waivers and get offered back to the ORGANIZATION for half of his $100,000 Draft price before he can get sent to the Minors in 2019.",0
"PERSON mostly played shortstop in GPE, but the ORGANIZATION liked his potential behind the plate and moved him there as soon as they signed him for $1.3 million in 2012. Many of GPE's top catching prospects in recent years have been offense-first players, but PERSON profiles as a solid defender who can contribute with the bat. He'll miss the entire 2015 season after surgery to repair a torn labrum in his shoulder in January, but he'll still be 19 when he returns in 2016.He has a strong arm and has had no problems figuring out the quick footwork and transfer he needs as a catcher, throwing out 41 percent of basestealers in his first two pro seasons. PERSON' receiving is still a work in progress but he has the hands and athleticism to improve in that regard.PERSON has a mature approach at the plate, showing patience and using the whole field. He has a quick bat and should provide double-digit home run power once he gets stronger. He may lack PERSON's potential impact bat but has a better chance of remaining a catcher.",1
"PERSON was a 45 FV on last year's ranking, evaluated as an MLB-ready utility infielder or low-end regular at shortstop. During the offseason he was shot in the hip during a robbery in GPE and required surgery. The initial surgery was botched and PERSON needed a second operation during the summer, which ended his regular season. When he returned to action in the ORGANIZATION, he had clearly lost a step overall, but it was most obvious when watching PERSON play defense. There's a chance this was just rust and that PERSON will go back to doing the things that placed him in the ORGANIZATION' offseason infield conversation before he was shot; average range and plus actions at short, a plus arm, some speed, and feel for contact. He'll bounce back into the 45 FV tier if those things return in the spring, but he looked like a fringe bench piece last fall.",1
"The ORGANIZATION have a knack for finding and developing tremendous pitching talent and PERSON is no exception. The former high school standout from the ORGANIZATION has thrown very well at two rookie levels since joining the organization in 2011 as the ORGANIZATION try to protect his impressive left arm. PERSON will touch 94-95 mph with his fastball now and there might be more in the tank as he matures. His changeup is the better of his two secondary offerings right now and it might be a consistently plus pitch for him. His slider might project to plus as well, though it's just average right now. He generally throws strikes and he should have at least average command in the future. The ORGANIZATION are great about being patient with their pitching prospects, so PERSON will start moving more quickly when he's ready.",1
"Some college catchers have excellent bats while the jury is out about whether they can stay behind the plate. PERSON is the opposite, a sure-fire backstop defensively who will have to prove he can hit at the next level. A hamate injury that kept him out for a chunk of the 2017 season didn't help matters, though he did return as the ORGANIZATION approached and showed enough that the GPE felt comfortable taking him in the sixth round.PERSON has serious defensive skills behind the plate. He's the kind of take-charge player teams like to see from the position. He works with pitchers well, has good hands and catch-and-throw skills. There's a reason he was chosen to catch for the GPE National Team both as a high schooler, when he hit well, and last summer for the ORGANIZATION, where he didn't swing the bat effectively. There is some pop in his bat, but it is definitely behind the defensive tools.When healthy, PERSON pushed teammate JJ Schwarz from behind the plate because of his superior defensive skills. He profiles as a future defensive-minded backup, though it's fair to believe there might also be some untapped potential in his bat.",0
"  After signing PERSON out of GPE in 2010, the ORGANIZATION sent him to the ORGANIZATION League the next season to make his professional debut as a 17-year-old. The ORGANIZATION acquired him two years later in exchange for PERSON. PERSON has been young for his level throughout his career but has developed a solid reputation as a hitter. He has a good feel for the barrel, leading to high batting averages and low strikeout totals. His swing mostly produces line drives instead of home runs, but there might be some more power waiting to be unlocked in his projectable frame. PERSON is a below-average runner, limiting him defensively. He has improved in left field, but his bat will have to continue to produce as he advances through the ORGANIZATION.",0
"PERSON spent two summers in the ORGANIZATION after signing out of the GPE in 2011. The slightly undersized right-hander didn't disappoint in his highly anticipated stateside debut in 2014, when he showed the ability to miss bats with electric stuff en route to recording 10.1 strikeouts per nine innings in the Rookie-level PERSON. The ORGANIZATION expected big things from him in 2015, though he was unable to take the next step as an avulsion fracture in his elbow limited him to just 20 innings. He finally made his full-season debut in 2016, pitching as part of a loaded piggyback starting rotation at ORGANIZATION A Wisconsin. In December, he was selected by the Twins with the first pick in the Rule 5 Draft, only to be traded to GPE.  When healthy, PERSON's lightning-quick arm generates a fastball in the mid-90s with late movement from a high three-quarters slot. His slider, thrown in the 75-77 mph range with good lateral action, has the chance to be an out pitch if he can throw it for strikes. His changeup lags behind his two other offerings, but club officials believe it will become an effective third pitch for him once he creates better velocity separation relative to his heater. He has the ability to miss bats naturally, though his control and command require refinement, as does his mechanics. PERSON's elbow injury required subsequent surgery, but he was not limited by the injury in 2016. Although the ORGANIZATION may continue to develop him as a starter, his fastball-slider pairing gives him undeniable upside in a late-inning bullpen role.",1
"A relative veteran of the amateur showcase circuit, PERSON has been a prospect for quite some time. With his size and stuff, he has the chance to make an even bigger name for himself at the next level.PERSON has room to add strength to his 6-foot-4 frame, and that might allow him to add to his fastball that often touches 93 mph and features a ton of heavy sink. Both his changeup and his breaking ball have the chance to be at least PERSON average. He has a good feel for pitching overall and has improved his command thanks to some refinement to his delivery. PERSON may not light up radar guns to the extent some of this year's Draft prospects do, but his ground-ball ability, feel for pitching and room for growth still make him very intriguing.",0
"That the ORGANIZATION were unable to sign 2013 first-rounder PERSON is more and more looking like a blessing in disguise, as it gave the club the financial freedom to give ORGANIZATION an $850,000 bonus as a 30th-round pick. He has established himself as one of the best all-around hitters in the system in 2015 and made a smooth transition to Double-A last year, hitting a career-high 23 home runs and finishing second and third in the LOCATION in on-base percentage (.387) and slugging (.530), respectively.ORGANIZATION's robust raw power has been on display since his days at ORGANIZATION (Calif.) High, but it wasn't until 2015 that he began tapping into it in games with consistency. A physically strong left-handed hitter, ORGANIZATION possesses the requisite bat speed to turn on premium velocity as well as the barrel control to drive the ball out of the park the other way. A more consistent and confident approach resulted in vastly improved strikeout and walk rates in his first Double-A exposure, and he also showed more utility against same-side hurlers. Though a fringy defender at first base, ORGANIZATION has worked hard to upgrade his defense to where it should at least be serviceable. Meanwhile, ORGANIZATION officials rave about ORGANIZATION's work ethic and makeup, citing his determination to improve his body and defense as examples.While the emergence of All-Star first baseman PERSON doesn't bode well for ORGANIZATION cracking the ORGANIZATION' lineup anytime soon, it will provide him with as much time as needed to develop in the ORGANIZATION. The first-base-only profile is a notoriously difficult one to achieve, but he has the hitting ability and power to make it happen.",1
"We're undeterred by PERSON's childlike measurables because, for a 5-foot-8 guy, he actually has a good frame and lots of present baseball skill that should start yielding on-field results as he gets stronger. He's a plus athlete and runner with a high baseball IQ, switch-hits, and is going to stay on the infield. Unlike his prototypically-sized peers, whose attributes are more obvious in showcase environments, it takes longer to get a feel for and appreciate skillsets like PERSON's. We think it's why skills-over-tools infielders like this tend to sneak up on us, and we're trying to suss out this profile earlier than we have in the past. If PERSON's strength never materializes, he's probably just a utility guy, at best. If it does, he could be a well-rounded every day player.",0
"After a strong showing in the ORGANIZATION in 2013, PERSON was well on his way to being a top-five pick in the 2014 GPE before undergoing PERSON surgery in May. Despite his injury, he didn't fall far on GPE day, as the ORGANIZATION grabbed him ninth overall.PERSON hasn't fully grown into his lanky 6-foot-4 frame, yet at times he works in the mid 90s and hits 98 mph with his fastball. His big-breaking curveball can be equally devastating and his changeup can be a plus pitch at times. He throws a decent amount of strikes but will need to refine his command to become a frontline starter in the big leagues.As long as he's healthy, PERSON gives the ORGANIZATION farm system another impact arm. He'll have a chance to prove that when he makes his professional debut in 2015.",1
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON for $2 million just before the clock struck midnight on the 2015-2016 ORGANIZATION Agent signing period, then traded him to PERSON for PERSON a few weeks later, before PERSON had even played a pro game. PERSON took things slow for the first year 10 months, and left PERSON in the ORGANIZATION in 2016 and in GPE Spring Training to start 2017, but he has moved very quickly since then, climbing to a new minor league level every half season. And he has performed. PERSON is a career .301/.381/.507 hitter in the minors, has always been young relative to his level, and reached Triple-A last year shortly after he turned 21. He has big, all-fields raw power, and balls he mis-hits will often still find their way to the warning track. While PERSON has good natural timing in the box and isn't often fooled by breaking stuff, he does have limited bat control and we anticipate his batting averages will be lower in majors than they have been thus far. 
ORGANIZATION for his size, PERSON has mostly played left field as a pro and he's a 40 runner underway, but he appeared to stiffen last year and most teams have him projected to first base or DH. That will limit his overall value and makes his lack of bat control a little scary, but we still think PERSON will become an average regular, and possibly get an opportunity quite soon.",1
"The ORGANIZATION gave seven-figure bonuses to three high school pitchers in the 2014 Draft: $1.1 million to PERSON in the fourth round, $1 million to PERSON in the fifth and $1.5 million to since-traded PERSON in the sixth. All three have had elbow surgery since turning pro, with PERSON succumbing to PERSON surgery last August. He had been enjoying his best pro season, ranking second in the ORGANIZATION with a 2.92 ERA when he blew out his elbow.PERSON began to make the transition from thrower to pitcher in 2017. He did a better job of commanding his fastball, which ranges from 91-97 mph with groundout-inducing sink. He got more consistent depth and missed more bats with his curveball, and he also showed more trust in his changeup.PERSON also made progress with his control and command, though both need further improvement. More athletic than physical, he has started to create hope that he could become a mid-rotation starter. He returned to the mound earlier than expected in mid-2018, showing the same stuff that began to get GPE excited before he got hurt.",0
"One of the better two-way talents in the 2018 Draft class, GPE has a fastball that peaks in the low 90s and a promising breaking ball. He shows even more promise as a hitter, enough to get selected as early as the third round. Whether that will be high enough to lure him away from a ORGANIZATION commitment remains to be seen.GPE's quick right-handed swing with loft and his strength combine to generate impressive raw power, which he showed off by finishing second in the home run derby at the ORGANIZATION All-American Classic last August. He lets his pop come naturally and uses the entire field, showing the potential to hit for average as well. He has a track record of performing well against top competition on the showcase circuit, starring on the loaded PERSON travel team.While GPE is a well below-average runner, he moves well enough to make plays at third base. His hands and arm strength are assets, and he could become a solid defender if he can improve his agility. He'll have to maintain the conditioning of his thick frame to remain at the hot corner.",0
"ORGANIZATION Premier Event: Feb. 5, 2017 - ORGANIZATION MLB Team: PERSON ORGANIZATION MLB Player: PERSON took part in the 17U ORGANIZATION Development Program in 2016, going 2-for-8 over three games with the ORGANIZATION team.PERSON has an upright stance and was impressive in batting practice, barreling several balls out of an upright stance. In game action, PERSON struggled to adjust to offspeed pitches but has a chance to improve with maturity.The catcher has the arm strength to play the position, but he presently lacks accuracy throwing to second base.",0
"GPE's top prep prospect in 2015, PERSON was best known for his speed but wowed the Cubs by driving the ball to all fields during a pre-PERSON workout at FACILITY. He became one of their four seven-figure bonus babies in that PERSON, passing on a ORGANIZATION commitment to sign for $1.3 million in the fourth round. He made adjustments after a slow start at short-season Eugene last summer and one club official compared his upside to that of PERSON has some of the best all-around tools in the system, starting with well above-average speed that drew him football recruiting interest from PERSON and PERSON as a wide receiver. His quickness enhances his ability to get on base and he knows how to use it once he does. It also makes him an asset in center field, where he displays fine instincts and has an average, accurate arm.While PERSON will need time to develop at the plate, he could become a .275 hitter with 15 homers and 30 steals on an annual basis. He has a compact left-handed swing and generates sneaky power with his ability to backspin the ball from center to right field. He makes a lot of hard contact but is still in the process of solving left-handed pitching.",0
"GPE ORGANIZATION has three right-handers who could go in top three rounds of the 2017 Draft in PERSON, PERSON and PERSON. PERSON was as good as any pitcher in the talent-laden LOCATION during the first half of the 2016 season before tiring down the stretch and taking the summer off. He put up better numbers than ever as a junior despite pitching through an oblique injury, though his chances of going in the first round took a hit when he blew out his elbow in late April and required PERSON surgery.PERSON relies heavily on a 92-94 mph fastball that can reach 96 and features power sink. Both his slider and curveball can be plus pitches at times but also lack consistency, and he also mixes in a decent changeup. He generally throws strikes but can be vulnerable if his pitches wander up in the strike zone.PERSON isn't the most physical pitcher but got stronger as a sophomore after working around 90 mph as a freshman. He maintained his improved velocity until he got hurt this spring, but scouts don't love his delivery and now have even more questions about his durability.",0
"The ORGANIZATION shocked other teams when they gave PERSON $4.95 million to sign out of the ORGANIZATION in 2011, a record that should stand for a while thanks to bonus limitations established in the latest ORGANIZATION Agreement. The ORGANIZATION saw him as a prospect with a tremendous body and power potential, and they believe he's on the verge of a breakthrough.PERSON still is growing into his 6-foot-4 frame and is raw at the plate, yet he managed to hit 13 homers as an 18-year-old in low Class A last year. He has the bat speed and loft to provide plenty of home runs, though like many of GPE' top position prospects, he'll need to tone down his aggressiveness.With his power and solid arm strength, PERSON profiles easily in right field. He's a below-average runner but has improved his reads in the outfield and gets the job done defensively.",1
"Since the ORGANIZATION drafted PERSON in the fourth round of the 2013 Draft and went above slot to sign him away from the ORGANIZATION of GPE, he's looked like the prototypical pitchability lefty, one who was poised to contribute to the big league rotation in 2018. When he did get the chance in GPE, however, he really struggled to find the strike zone. His command in the ORGANIZATION regressed a bit as well, but he didn't get hit en route to finishing second in the organization in ORGANIZATION. An elbow injury kept him from making any progress in 2019.Outside of an inflated walk rate in the ORGANIZATION, PERSON wasn't hittable and posted low ORGANIZATIONs in both Double-A and Triple-A when healthy, using his typical feel for pitching and deception to allow his largely average stuff play up. His fastball will sit in the low 90s, though he can reach back for more on occasion, and he throws it with good life. His sinking changeup is his best pitch, a plus offspeed offering that he keeps down in the zone. He mixes in his average curveball effectively.The ORGANIZATION hope the adversity PERSON faced in his brief big league stint will help him move forward in the long run. He worked with pitching coach PERSON, focusing on the mechanics with his lower half, to streamline his delivery. The combination could help the 6-foot-5 southpaw be ready to contribute in a bigger way once he is 100 percent healthy.",1
"A product of PERSON (PERSON, Ga.), PERSON has a similar profile to former ORGANIZATION. He turned down the ORGANIZATION as a 28th-rounder in 2013 to attend PERSON, and he impressed last summer in the ORGANIZATION, where he was one of the fastest players and ranked fifth with five homers. His ORGANIZATION stock has suffered because he hasn't hit with as much authority since a ball tipped off his glove and broke three bones in his face right before the season started, though he should go in the first three to five rounds.PERSON still brings well above-average speed to the table, with some evaluators giving him double-plus run grades. Though he's an obvious basestealing threat, he doesn't swipe as many bags as he could and needs to refine his technique. His quickness makes him a fine defender in center field, where he has a playable arm.PERSON is still searching for his identity at the plate. His speed could translate into on-base ability at the top of the order, but he also has shown the potential for at least gap power in the past and has the strength to pull some home runs to left field. He sometimes gets caught in between the two approaches and doesn't control the strike zone particularly well, though scouts do rave about his makeup and believe he may figure it out in pro ball.",0
"PERSON looked like an elite international prospect when he dominated the 18-and-under World Championships in September 2012, but his stuff and delivery regressed significantly by the time he pitched for GPE as an 18-year-old in the World Baseball Classic the following spring. Undaunted, GPE signed PERSON for $1.625 million last July.The early returns on that investment have the ORGANIZATION optimistic that they could have a future No. 3 starter on their hands. PERSON was so impressive in Spring Training this year that GPE sent him to Class A for his pro debut, and he got off to a terrific start at ORGANIZATION County.PERSON's stuff has bounced back to where he's pitching with a consistent 90-95 mph fastball. He also can get swings and misses with his curveball. PERSON has advanced feel for his changeup and for finding the strike zone with all three of his offerings.",1
"The son of former big leaguer PERSON, and brother of ORGANIZATION farmhand PERSON, PERSON clearly has some serious baseball bloodlines. Though he didn't come off the board as early as his brother did back in 2011, when the ORGANIZATION took him 51st overall, PERSON's impressive bat still got him drafted by ORGANIZATION in the second round (ORGANIZATION. 66 overall), not to mention an above-slot singing bonus of $1,100,000. Like the others in his family, PERSON does things in an unconventional way, but he has had some success against good competition. Over the summer, PERSON showed the ability to square up quality pitching, and his raw power was on display when he won the Under PERSON All-American Game Home Run Derby in GPE. This spring, he was still hitting the long ball but also was getting tied up on mid-range fastballs inside. While he doesn't have the same exact leg kick setup as his father and brother, there are a lot of moving parts to his swing, which concerns some scouts. He does have more bat speed than his brother did coming out of high school. A below-average runner, PERSON may continue to see time at shortstop, but, in the long run, he's probably best suited defensively for second base, or perhaps even left field.PERSON immediately rewarded the ORGANIZATION by raking during his pro debut in the ORGANIZATION. There will continue to be questions surrounding his unorthodox setup and swing mechanics, but he's well on his way to becoming a productive, offensive-minded player at the highest level.",1
"A 33rd-round pick by the ORGANIZATION in 2012 out of the ORGANIZATION prep ranks, PERSON was a two-way player at the ORGANIZATION of LOCATION in 2013 before signing with the GPE for $120,000 as a ninth-rounder. He took off after making some delivery adjustments last year, and then continued to climb the ladder in 2017, moving up to Double-A and becoming an LOCATION All-Star. PERSON's progress caught the eye of the ORGANIZATION, who acquired him and second baseman PERSON for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION. PERSON can run his fastball up to 92-93 mph but usually sits more in the 88-91 mph range. Though not overpowering, PERSON's heater plays above its velocity on account of his deception, allowing him to induce whiffs inside the zone. He has good feel for his curveball, showing the ability to throw it for a strike and also bury it in the dirt when vying for whiffs, and he's adept at adding and subtracting with the pitch as needed. His changeup gives him a third average-or-better offering, albeit one he uses sparingly, and he has good command of all three pitches.Because he lacks a plus pitch and thrives based on deception, PERSON will have to prove himself at each level. He has handled every challenge so far, and while he's not a top-tier prospect, the left-hander has a legitimate floor as a backend starter in the ORGANIZATION.",1
"Throwing out of the bullpen ever since he signed back in 2012 out of GPE, PERSON has moved steadily through up the ORGANIZATION' ladder as a two-pitch short reliever. After a 2016 season that saw him reach Double-A at age 21 and go to the ORGANIZATION, PERSON was added to the 40-man roster to be protected from the Rule 5 Draft. He's rewarded the organization's faith in him by pitching well enough to make his big league debut in 2017.PERSON gets swings and misses on both his fastball and slider, striking out 10.5 per nine innings in his ORGANIZATION career heading into the 2017 season. He throws his fastball in the 92-95 mph range and it plays up because of its plus run, sink and spin. His slider is more slurvy than anything else, but it has a lot of depth to it. He's not a sidearmer by any means, but he does employ a low and short arm slot that provides a lot of deception. Hitters do not pick the ball up well coming out of his hands. He's done a very nice job in his career of staying in the strike zone.PERSON has closed games throughout his ORGANIZATION career, saving 32 over the last two seasons combined. His stuff is probably a little short to keep doing that in the big leagues, but he's looking like he'll be able to fill a bullpen role there in the near future.",1
"A small-ish infielder with above-average bat speed, PERSON has good pull-side pop for an 18-year-old. His swing is geared for contact at the top of the strike zone, which is where more and more pitchers are starting to work. He's a bit over-aggressive and needs to get stronger as he ages, but there are power-hitting components here if he can, as well as a good shot to stay on the infield at either second or third base.",0
"PERSON appeared to be on his way toward becoming a first-round pick in the 2016 GPE after a strong start to his junior season at GPE, only to miss most of April and May with a shoulder injury. But he was able to get back on the mound and prove that he was healthy in the weeks before the GPE, and the A's felt good enough about his medicals to take him in GPE Round A with the 37th overall pick. They assigned him to Class A Advanced Stockton for his first full season, but PERSON made just two starts before it was announced he would need season-ending PERSON surgery. PERSON can add and subtract from his heater, sitting comfortably in the low 90s but also reaching back for 95 mph, with feel for locating to both sides of the plate as well as down in the zone. His changeup is his best secondary pitch, a mid-80s offering thrown with fastball-like arm speed and late fading action, and he has the makings of a slider that projects to at least Major League-average. A consistent, over-the-top release point allows him to create plane towards the plate, and everything he throws plays up due to his advanced control and command. Meanwhile, scouts expect PERSON to miss more bats with improvement to both his changeup and slider. PERSON is a good athlete with clean arm action and a repeatable delivery, though as an undersized righty, he'll need to prove he can physically handle the rigors of a full season on the mound. He'll miss the remainder of the 2017 season, as well as some of the following year, but PERSON possesses the stuff and pitchability to become a No. 4 starter in the big leagues.",0
"In 2015, ORGANIZATION set the single-season strikeout record at LSU-Eunice, a junior college that produces a lot of pro baseball talent. He transferred to GPE and spent his junior year pitching mostly out of the ORGANIZATION bullpen. He signed for $100,000. GPE has tried him in the rotation and in long relief and ORGANIZATION has been fairly successful at both, but he projects as a two-pitch reliever long-term. His low-90s fastball has flat plane and lives in the top of the strike zone. It's hard to differentiate between it and his 12-6 curveball, which is effective against both-handed hitters.",0
"Traded from GPE in exchange for PERSON, PERSON was a heavy-bodied, power-hitting prospect with no position. Since the trade, he has remade himself physically, and now has a physique similar to PERSON O'Neill. GPE term, PERSON still projects to first base and he may lack the approach and contact skills to produce at the level necessary to profile there.",0
"GPE was viewed as one of the more advanced college hurlers in the 2015 Draft following an impressive career at ORGANIZATION that included a national championship (2013). The ORGANIZATION took GPE 16th overall, making him the highest-drafted college pitcher in franchise history, and then signed him for $2.65 million. Unfortunately, injuries have subsequently derailed GPE's development, as a strained flexor muscle in his forearm limited him to just three starts in is first full season, while PERSON surgery the following spring wiped out his entire 2017 campaign. It will now be up to the A's to get GPE back on track after they acquired him, PERSON and PERSON for PERSON at the ORGANIZATION Deadline.After working at 88-92 mph in college with a fastball that stood out more for its sink and command than it did for velocity, GPE saw his velocity jump to 93-96 mph while touching 99 upon entering pro ball. He possesses a deep secondary arsenal, including a curveball, slider and changeup that all grade as at least above-average pitches when they're on. GPE controls and commands his pitches very well, doing a good job of delivering all of them from the same arm slot.Considered more of a pitchability right-hander with a ceiling of a No. 3 starter when the ORGANIZATION drafted him, GPE has shown frontline stuff when healthy. He's fallen well behind the development curve and will have his workload monitored carefully moving forward, but the overall ingredients are there for GPE to still move quickly once he finally returns to the mound, likely in mid-2018.",0
"Scouts have praised PERSON's athleticism and they like his projectable body. In the batter's box, PERSON has gained a reputation for making good contact, especially in the inner half of the plate. Like most prospects his age, PERSON still needs to improve on his hitting mechanics and approach at the plate. He's expected to be able to drive the ball to all fields once he improves on the minor flaws in his batting technique.On defense, PERSON has shown decent footwork and good hands. He has the range to make the routine plays and his overall skill set on defense is expected to improve once he is placed into an academy and receives more instruction. He has also shown a strong arm.PERSON has displayed the ability to use his skill set in games. The ORGANIZATION teen racked up five hits and scored four runs in three games during PERSON's ORGANIZATION in February. He also walked twice.PERSON is trained by his father, PERSON.",0
"The ORGANIZATION signed PERSON, the top-rated pitcher on MLB.com's Top 30 international prospects list in 2013, for $1.3 million only to trade him to the Brewers the following offseason part of the ORGANIZATION trade. He made the jump to full-season ball with promising results, as the right-hander emerged as one of the better young hurlers in the low minors, earning All-Star honors at ORGANIZATION A Wisconsin, en route to a promotion to the ORGANIZATION State League in July. While he's taken a step back in 2017, PERSON remains one of the more electric and projectable hurlers in GPE's system.PERSON's big-time arm strength belies his undersized, slender frame, as he'll produce a fastball that can reach 98 mph and sits at 92-96 mph with late movement. And with remaining physical projection, many scouts expect the right-hander to sit in the mid-90s at maturity. PERSON complements his heater with a plus slider, and he has surprisingly advanced feel for throwing a changeup. After showing solid control of his entire three-pitch mix in 2016, PERSON's feel for the zone has been inconsistent, resulting in elevated pitch counts and too many abbreviated outings.PERSON is adept at missing bats and generating weak contact with his two plus pitches, giving him the ceiling of a No. 3 starter or a high-leverage reliever if he can regain his control and command. ORGANIZATION officials are quick to praise the young righty for his makeup and overall aptitude, qualities they believe will help him stay the course as a starter.",0
"PERSON has proved to be the advanced hitter the ORGANIZATION hoped he'd become when they signed him out of the ORGANIZATION in December 2013. After advancing to full-season ball in 2015, PERSON saw his stock skyrocket last season in the Class A Advanced California League, where, as the circuit's youngest everyday player on Opening Day, he won the batting title and ORGANIZATION award at age 19. Moved up to Double-A in 2017, PERSON has reaffirmed why scouts view him as one of the ORGANIZATION' more advanced hitters with an All-Star campaign in the ORGANIZATION League.With an approach that belies his age, PERSON demonstrates an advanced feel for the strike zone and has excellent pitch recognition, the combination of which netted him more walks (40) than strikeouts (36) in 2016. The right-handed hitter's bat-to-ball skills are equally impressive, as his short, level swing produces line drives across the entire field. And while he may never offer much over-the-fence power in games, PERSON should be a consistent source of extra-base hits thanks to his knack for pounding the gaps. An average defender at second base with an above-average arm, PERSON has made a smooth transition to shortstop in 2017.PERSON' advanced approach and innate feel for hitting has him poised to become an impact player in the big leagues, while his successful transition to shortstop only increased his value.",1
"PERSON powered GPE to its first PERSON Series appearance and first outright Big Ten Conference regular-season championship since 1932 last year, slugging a school-record 18 homers and ranking third in ORGANIZATION Division I in that category. Undrafted and relatively unknown coming out of an Ohio high school, he has since established himself as the premier power hitter in the 2014 college PERSON class. He offers lots of strength and bat speed from the left side of the plate, and he's not a one-dimensional hitter either. PERSON controls the strike zone well and repeatedly barrels balls, so he should hit for a high average as well. His offensive ability could make him a star as a catcher -- provided that he can stay behind the plate. While he moves well for his size, his throwing and receiving both grade as below average and could prompt a move to the outfield, where he has seen time for the ORGANIZATION.",1
"PERSON spent two years at ORGANIZATION in the GPE, GPE., area before switching his academics to the online PERSON and his baseball to the ORGANIZATION. He finished his coursework to graduate last fall, giving him months to focus on baseball full-time to prepare for life as a pro or as another talented arm at the ORGANIZATION of Florida.The work allowed PERSON to get his body in shape and helped him show off his arm strength more consistently. He's capable of running his fastball up to 96-97 mph, especially in shorter stints. His breaking ball will flash average, but it will often get caught between a curveball and a slider with a 10-to-4-type break, though at times he'll go to a more conventional slider, and he does have some feel for a changeup. While he throws strikes with his heater, its lack of movement makes it play down a bit. He can be inverted in back during his delivery, impacting his plane.As a result, some see a future reliever profile, though he has shown the stuff and control to start. The biggest thing that might keep PERSON from going in the top six rounds is a rumored price tag, with him donning a Gators uniform in the fall a distinct possibility.Prospect Development PERSON - PERSON, GPE.",0
"There were several things the ORGANIZATION knew PERSON would have to work on when they signed him in the summer of 2013. He was coming from a relatively non-baseball playing country in GPE, he had been an infielder, and he was almost painfully thin, so there wasn't much of a foundation of any sort to build from.PERSON has made strides on all those fronts, though forearm strains have limited his ability to take the mound. He's added a lot of strength and now tops 200 pounds, a far cry from the 155 he weighed when he signed. The right-hander throws what's best described as ""easy gas"" that gets up to 95-96 mph consistently, coming from a very quick arm. He shows he can spin an improving breaking ball, but both his curve and his changeup are inconsistent and need to be refined. PERSON can get too amped up on the mound and needs to learn to manage his effort level, with an understanding that his stuff will still be there when he does so.It's possible PERSON's high energy style to go along with his fastball-curve combination, might be best suited coming out of the bullpen. For now, he'll keep starting so he can get more reps to continue making progress on building that foundation.",1
"Back in 2015, the ORGANIZATION spent a Draft-record $17,865,000 on bonuses. That included shelling out $900,000 for PERSON in the 11th round, when signability concerns drove his stock down. It's been extremely slow going for the left-hander, though he was gaining some traction and pitching well in 2018 when he was sent to the ORGANIZATION in a deal for catcher PERSON's best pitch continues to be his curveball, a slow deep breaking ball that flashes plus. He'll throw his fastball in the 88-92 mph range and will mix in an average slider and will show good feel for an average changeup as well. As PERSON has progressed, particularly in 2018, his command has improved and he throws a ton of strikes with all four of his pitches.PERSON's ceiling is somewhat limited to that of a back-end starter. He'd never thrown more than 62 innings in a season before the 2018 season, with the ORGANIZATION perhaps getting him right when he's starting to figure things out.",1
"PERSON PERSON made a name for himself in GPE and international baseball circles. Now, he has his eyes set on fulfilling his Major League dream.PERSON, 21, is a 5-foot-10, 185-pound center fielder with a good mix of power and speed, and lots of potential. The left-handed hitter starred on GPE's 18U junior team in 2014 and '15, and later hit .333/.469/.498 in the ORGANIZATION during the '16-17 season, with six home runs and 24 stolen bases in 264 plate appearances over 61 games.PERSON is known for his speed on the bases and in the outfield and his above-average power. PERSON also like his makeup.PERSON defected from GPE last year and later established residency in GPE. He was cleared by PERSON on Feb. 20 and will be eligible to sign on March 6. Because of his age and experience, PERSON will be subject to the international signing guidelines. PERSON, who is considered to have the talent to start in Class A Advanced or Double-A once he signs, has been training in GPE. The ORGANIZATION are the favorite to sign him.",0
"GPE has a big frame, smooth arm action and has run it up to 97 mph along with an above average curveball, so the starter traits and solid health indicators are there, but the lack of a plus secondary pitch has him in the second tier of prep arms.",0
